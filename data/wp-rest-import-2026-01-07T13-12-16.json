      "content": "<p>Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to £100…<br />\nIf they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this…</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.<br />\nThe fifth would pay £1.<br />\nThe sixth would pay £3.<br />\nThe seventh would pay £7..<br />\nThe eighth would pay £12.<br />\nThe ninth would pay £18.<br />\nThe tenth man (the richest) would pay £59.</p>\n<p>So, that’s what they decided to do..</p>\n<p>The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve ball.</p>\n<p>“Since you are all such good customers,” he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by £20”. Drinks for the ten men would now cost just £80.</p>\n<p>The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.</p>\n<p>So the first four men were unaffected.</p>\n<p>They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men?<br />\nThe paying customers?</p>\n<p>How could they divide the £20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?</p>\n<p>They realised that £20 divided by six is £3.33. But if they<br />\nsubtracted that from everybody’s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.</p>\n<p>So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man’s bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.</p>\n<p>And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).</p>\n<p>The sixth now paid £2 instead of £3 (33% saving).</p>\n<p>The seventh now paid £5 instead of £7 (28% saving).<br />\nThe eighth now paid £9 instead of £12 (25% saving).</p>\n<p>The ninth now paid £14 instead of £18 (22% saving).</p>\n<p>The tenth now paid £49 instead of £59 (16% saving).</p>\n<p>Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.</p>\n<p>“I only got a pound out of the £20 saving,” declared the sixth man.</p>\n<p>He pointed to the tenth man,”but he got £10!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth man. “I only saved a pound too. It’s unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!”</p>\n<p>“That’s true!” shouted the seventh man. “Why should he get £10 back, when I got only £2? The wealthy get all the breaks!”</p>\n<p>“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in unison, “we didn’t get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!”</p>\n<p>The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.</p>\n<p>The next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn’t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!</p>\n<p>And that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works.</p>\n<p>The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction.</p>\n<p>Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore.</p>\n<p>In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.</p>\n<p>David R.

For those businesses whose income comes from the Great British Summertime, you’ll be looking to spread your summer takings over the leaner months. Other businesses may be gearing up for the Christmas season, and most likely have plenty of outgoings at the moment as you buy stock ready for the seasonal rush.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Research from <a href=\"http://www.santandercb.co.uk/businessupclose/promotion/seasons-of-change\">Santander Corporate &amp; Commercial</a> suggests that 61% of UK SMEs are affected by seasonality, so you are not alone! Here are our top tips for managing your cash flow if you have a seasonal business:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Planning: </strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">Cash flow forecasting</a> is essential for all businesses, but for a seasonal business it is critical. Surprisingly Santander found that smaller companies were less likely to plan for seasonality than larger organisations. 36% of those with annual revenues between £50,000 and £100,000 fail to prepare. A detailed plan combining your sales forecast, stock levels and business costs is the only way you can implement any financial strategy for seasonal fluctuations.</li>\n<li><strong>Invoice Promptly:</strong> Do you know how much money is currently owed to your business? Across the UK SMEs are currently carrying £39.4 billion in late payments! For any seasonal business it is imperative that you can bank what is owed to you and therefore invoicing should be a top priority. In fact it has been shown that invoicing promptly is more likely to result in a prompt payment; if your client receives your invoice while your business is still fresh in their mind, they are more likely to settle it than if you leave it to the end of the month.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Stock Lean:</strong> Keeping large amounts of stock means your money is tied up in goods that are not earning for you. You may also be paying for storage facilities on top. Stock control will help you manage this as will sales forecasting, so that you can ensure your stock levels remain at an optimal level.</li>\n<li><strong>Negotiate With Suppliers</strong>: If you need to buy in stock or services then make sure you are getting the best possible deal. You may be able to drive down the cost of goods by negotiating a sale-or-return arrangement or discounts on bulk orders (although be mindful of your stock levels). Also try to come to a favourable payment arrangement, perhaps spreading payments over a period of time, or so that they fall during your cash-rich period.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce Your Costs During Slow Periods</strong>: 1 in 20 UK businesses temporarily close during leaner periods. And these are not just small businesses; companies with a turnover in excess of 20 million are more likely to close to reduce costs. Whether this is appropriate for your business will depend on the structure of your organisation. However there could be other ways to reduce your spending during a seasonal lull; employing flexible or remote workers, reducing your overheads by working from home etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Short Term Finance</strong>: Invoice or supply chain finance is an option many small businesses use to bridge the gap between high seasons. Cash flow facilities can also be employed to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/payslip-calculator/\">pay wages</a> and suppliers when income has decreased. Of course many businesses use credit cards to manage their seasonal dip.</li>\n<li><strong>Save For A Rainy Day</strong>: Of course we all know that we should be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">saving a percentage of our earnings</a>, although how many of us do? Seasonal businesses can really reap the rewards of putting something aside in a business savings account during their high season, and using this to help them through the quieter months. If profits allow this is a much preferably course of action than taking out loans or finance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can keep up-to-date with our news and advice pages by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blackandwhiteacc\">following us on Facebook</a>.

      "content": "<p>For many businesses Christmas is the time of year when bells are ringing and tills are jingling! If your business is one of these, then you probably don’t even have time to read this blog post as you hit your busiest period! But for others, Christmas is the time of year when things begin to slow down and certainly for many businesses (including those currently enjoying the Christmas rush), trading can be very slow in January.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Managing your cashflow over quieter periods is essential, and now’s the time to get a financial plan in place to ensure your business survives the lull. Additionally, you may have extra expenditure over the Christmas period (Christmas parties, corporate gifts, staff bonuses), as well as factoring in Bank Holidays and any annual leave staff may take. Having a comprehensive overview of your business cashflow is therefore vital.</p>\n<p>10 Tips For Small Businesses To <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/financial-director-and-non-executive-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Manage Finances</a> Over Christmas</p>\n<p>Here are my tips for managing your business finances and having a healthy start to the New Year:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Financial Planning</strong> – have a clear idea of finances going in and coming out over the Christmas period. Look at past history to predict when business is likely to pick up and by how much.</li>\n<li><strong>Negotiate Favourable Terms</strong> – try to spread or defer bills and other expenses so that your outgoings are minimised while your incomings are low. However, remember you will have to pay these at some point!</li>\n<li><strong>Be Proactive With Invoicing</strong> – if you generally leave your invoicing until the end of the month, get the money in earlier by invoicing promptly. Make it easy for clients to settle their invoices by BACS, Direct Debit etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Set Your Own Payment Terms</strong> – with new clients or one-off jobs negotiate more favourable payment terms for the Christmas holiday.</li>\n<li><strong>Conduct A Credit Check Against New Clients </strong>– unfortunately it can only take one bad debt to seriously upset your business finances, so although new custom will be welcome during a slow period it’s wise to make sure they are creditworthy.</li>\n<li><strong>Chase Late Payments </strong>– with potentially more time on your hands (or staff with a reduced workload) there’s no reason to allow debtors to fall behind. Put a plan in place to chase outstanding payments and ensure you’ve banked all money owed.</li>\n<li><strong>Review Your Banking Requirements</strong> – have a look at whether you could be getting a better deal on borrowing or charges elsewhere. Speak to your bank to see whether they can recommend ways or products that can help reduce your banking costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce Stock </strong>– keep your stock at a minimum so you are not paying out unnecessarily for items you are unlikely to shift. Old lines may benefit from being put on sale: take advantage of Black Friday (28 November), Cyber Monday (1 December) if your product lends itself to pre-Christmas sales, or Boxing Day where once again record numbers of people are expected to take advantage of sales on the High Street and online.</li>\n<li><strong>Take A Holiday</strong> – many employers give staff the days in between Christmas and New Year as holiday. This may seem like a generous gesture but it may also make financial sense. Although the cost savings of closing your premises may not cover your staffing bill, they can contribute to some savings. And if staff are not working at capacity anyway, it may be the best route for your business.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Relationships With Clients And Suppliers</strong> – spread some seasonal cheer by taking the opportunity to build on your existing business relationships, so ensuring that you have the foundations for a successful 2015. Whether you send cards or gifts, make an effort to thank them for their business and support over the past 12 months.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, if you are currently rushed off your feet fulfilling Christmas orders you’ll appreciate a rest in the New Year but don’t spend your earnings all at once! For businesses that rely on Christmas for a boost in their income, and those who also benefit from the New Year sales, financial planning for the rest of the year is crucial to make sure you are ready for Christmas 2015.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black &amp; White Accounting</a> we want our clients to make a success of their business and this can only start with sound financial planning.

      "content": "<p>We’ve all read articles about common accounting mistakes, in fact there are so many out there you might expect everyone to be wise to these errors. But for one reason or another people still make them and therefore, at the risk of clogging up the Internet with even more dos and don’ts, here are the 5 accounting mistakes I would like to see banished to Room 101.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Why Do People Make These Accounting Mistakes?</strong></p>\n<p>Before sharing my top five, let’s consider why business owners make these accounting blunders. I would surmise that many are a result of a hang up from previous accounting systems, before the business started to grow. Generally these are made in an attempt to reduce costs, but if they result in an incorrect tax return they could cost you instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #1 – Mixing personal and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/why-diy-accounting-is-dangerous/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"216\">business expenses</a></strong></p>\n<p>My first no-no is common with many self-employed individuals. You start <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">working in a freelance capacity</a> with minimal expenses and business overheads. Invoices to clients pretty much equate to a salary after you’ve paid tax and NI contributions. Because there is no legal reason for a self-employed <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader to open a separate bank account</a>, money can be paid into a personal account: the one that household expenses are paid from.</p>\n<p>This works perfectly well when the freelancer does not have many work-related outgoings. But problems occur when work changes. For example, perhaps a new project involves some additional outlay, or the client requires you to buy in materials or stock and invoice them for this. Whether it’s a one-off or a gradual <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-easy-is-it-to-change-accountants/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"120\">change in accounting</a> the self-employed individual finds themselves managing more business expenses through their personal bank account.</p>\n<p>This increased volume is what creates problems and potential error as you are forced to reconcile both your business and personal expenses. It also makes it more difficult for you to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">hand over your accounts to a bookkeeper</a> or accountant, as you are the only one who knows what is business and what is pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #2 – Doing it all yourself</strong></p>\n<p>Filing an annual tax return is not difficult if your accounts are fairly straightforward. If you’re earning a modest amount with few expenses and variables, DIYing is a viable thing to do. However, as your business grows and your offering changes your accounts may not be quite as straightforward, and here you could benefit from some outside help.</p>\n<p>Remember that although it will cost you to get an accountant to do this job for you, it can save you money too; and of course time. Instead delegate this job to someone who can help reduce your tax and free up your time to concentrate on other areas of your business.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #3 – Don’t hire family or friends</strong></p>\n<p>Keeping business in the family is great if your family (or friends) have the right skills, qualifications and attributes to do the job required. But just getting your spouse to do the books because it’s a cheap solution can cause personal and professional problems.</p>\n<p>Even if your friend or family member is qualified to do your accounts, be wary of favours and “mates rates”. Even with the best of intentions your friend may struggle to prioritise your accounts over their higher paying clients, and therefore you might not be getting such a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">great service</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #4 – Not keeping receipts</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s another reason you shouldn’t mix your business and personal accounts: receipts. If you’re guilty of having receipts stuffed in your wallet, handbag or pocket and no idea whether they are business expenses or your weekly supermarket shop, it’s time to get organised! Losing receipts costs you money. Without them you cannot claim for expenses you have incurred through your business. The solution is simple. Separate your finances so you have a dedicated business account (for the self-employed this can still be a personal bank account) and use your “business account” exclusively for that. Keep an envelope in your car / bag to put all business receipts in and weekly, or monthly, go through and file them.</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to store paper copies a digital scan/photo of both sides of the receipt is allowable, and if you are using Xero, or any other Cloud accounting system, you can attribute the receipt to the relevant expense online.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #5 – Not keeping an eye on the VAT threshold</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, another accounting mistake that is common with start-ups and the self-employed – not registering for VAT. Currently the VAT registration threshold stands at £81,000, this is based on your VAT taxable turnover – the total value of everything you sell or supply that isn’t VAT exempt. What people often forget is this is a rolling 12-month threshold, not based on your tax year. Therefore, you could find that an invoice dated for December pushes you over the threshold in the period December 2013 to December 2014. Checking your rolling turnover regularly is essential, especially if you are close to the threshold.</p>\n<p>I think the overriding lesson to be learnt from all these accounting mistakes is to be professional about your accounts from the start. However, all is not lost if you have started off on the wrong foot. An accountant can help you consolidate your accounts and put in place systems to enable you to manage your accounts efficiently.</p>\n<p>If you would like to speak to a member of the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black &amp; White</a> team about your accounts, tax returns or VAT, please get in touch.
