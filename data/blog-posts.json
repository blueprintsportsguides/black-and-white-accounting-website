      "content": "<p>Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to £100…<br />\nIf they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this…</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.<br />\nThe fifth would pay £1.<br />\nThe sixth would pay £3.<br />\nThe seventh would pay £7..<br />\nThe eighth would pay £12.<br />\nThe ninth would pay £18.<br />\nThe tenth man (the richest) would pay £59.</p>\n<p>So, that’s what they decided to do..</p>\n<p>The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve ball.</p>\n<p>“Since you are all such good customers,” he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by £20”. Drinks for the ten men would now cost just £80.</p>\n<p>The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.</p>\n<p>So the first four men were unaffected.</p>\n<p>They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men?<br />\nThe paying customers?</p>\n<p>How could they divide the £20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?</p>\n<p>They realised that £20 divided by six is £3.33. But if they<br />\nsubtracted that from everybody’s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.</p>\n<p>So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man’s bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.</p>\n<p>And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).</p>\n<p>The sixth now paid £2 instead of £3 (33% saving).</p>\n<p>The seventh now paid £5 instead of £7 (28% saving).<br />\nThe eighth now paid £9 instead of £12 (25% saving).</p>\n<p>The ninth now paid £14 instead of £18 (22% saving).</p>\n<p>The tenth now paid £49 instead of £59 (16% saving).</p>\n<p>Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.</p>\n<p>“I only got a pound out of the £20 saving,” declared the sixth man.</p>\n<p>He pointed to the tenth man,”but he got £10!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth man. “I only saved a pound too. It’s unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!”</p>\n<p>“That’s true!” shouted the seventh man. “Why should he get £10 back, when I got only £2? The wealthy get all the breaks!”</p>\n<p>“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in unison, “we didn’t get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!”</p>\n<p>The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.</p>\n<p>The next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn’t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!</p>\n<p>And that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works.</p>\n<p>The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction.</p>\n<p>Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore.</p>\n<p>In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.</p>\n<p>David R.

For those businesses whose income comes from the Great British Summertime, you’ll be looking to spread your summer takings over the leaner months. Other businesses may be gearing up for the Christmas season, and most likely have plenty of outgoings at the moment as you buy stock ready for the seasonal rush.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Research from <a href=\"http://www.santandercb.co.uk/businessupclose/promotion/seasons-of-change\">Santander Corporate &amp; Commercial</a> suggests that 61% of UK SMEs are affected by seasonality, so you are not alone! Here are our top tips for managing your cash flow if you have a seasonal business:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Planning: </strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">Cash flow forecasting</a> is essential for all businesses, but for a seasonal business it is critical. Surprisingly Santander found that smaller companies were less likely to plan for seasonality than larger organisations. 36% of those with annual revenues between £50,000 and £100,000 fail to prepare. A detailed plan combining your sales forecast, stock levels and business costs is the only way you can implement any financial strategy for seasonal fluctuations.</li>\n<li><strong>Invoice Promptly:</strong> Do you know how much money is currently owed to your business? Across the UK SMEs are currently carrying £39.4 billion in late payments! For any seasonal business it is imperative that you can bank what is owed to you and therefore invoicing should be a top priority. In fact it has been shown that invoicing promptly is more likely to result in a prompt payment; if your client receives your invoice while your business is still fresh in their mind, they are more likely to settle it than if you leave it to the end of the month.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Stock Lean:</strong> Keeping large amounts of stock means your money is tied up in goods that are not earning for you. You may also be paying for storage facilities on top. Stock control will help you manage this as will sales forecasting, so that you can ensure your stock levels remain at an optimal level.</li>\n<li><strong>Negotiate With Suppliers</strong>: If you need to buy in stock or services then make sure you are getting the best possible deal. You may be able to drive down the cost of goods by negotiating a sale-or-return arrangement or discounts on bulk orders (although be mindful of your stock levels). Also try to come to a favourable payment arrangement, perhaps spreading payments over a period of time, or so that they fall during your cash-rich period.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce Your Costs During Slow Periods</strong>: 1 in 20 UK businesses temporarily close during leaner periods. And these are not just small businesses; companies with a turnover in excess of 20 million are more likely to close to reduce costs. Whether this is appropriate for your business will depend on the structure of your organisation. However there could be other ways to reduce your spending during a seasonal lull; employing flexible or remote workers, reducing your overheads by working from home etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Short Term Finance</strong>: Invoice or supply chain finance is an option many small businesses use to bridge the gap between high seasons. Cash flow facilities can also be employed to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/payslip-calculator/\">pay wages</a> and suppliers when income has decreased. Of course many businesses use credit cards to manage their seasonal dip.</li>\n<li><strong>Save For A Rainy Day</strong>: Of course we all know that we should be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">saving a percentage of our earnings</a>, although how many of us do? Seasonal businesses can really reap the rewards of putting something aside in a business savings account during their high season, and using this to help them through the quieter months. If profits allow this is a much preferably course of action than taking out loans or finance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can keep up-to-date with our news and advice pages by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blackandwhiteacc\">following us on Facebook</a>.

      "content": "<p>For many businesses Christmas is the time of year when bells are ringing and tills are jingling! If your business is one of these, then you probably don’t even have time to read this blog post as you hit your busiest period! But for others, Christmas is the time of year when things begin to slow down and certainly for many businesses (including those currently enjoying the Christmas rush), trading can be very slow in January.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Managing your cashflow over quieter periods is essential, and now’s the time to get a financial plan in place to ensure your business survives the lull. Additionally, you may have extra expenditure over the Christmas period (Christmas parties, corporate gifts, staff bonuses), as well as factoring in Bank Holidays and any annual leave staff may take. Having a comprehensive overview of your business cashflow is therefore vital.</p>\n<p>10 Tips For Small Businesses To <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/financial-director-and-non-executive-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Manage Finances</a> Over Christmas</p>\n<p>Here are my tips for managing your business finances and having a healthy start to the New Year:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Financial Planning</strong> – have a clear idea of finances going in and coming out over the Christmas period. Look at past history to predict when business is likely to pick up and by how much.</li>\n<li><strong>Negotiate Favourable Terms</strong> – try to spread or defer bills and other expenses so that your outgoings are minimised while your incomings are low. However, remember you will have to pay these at some point!</li>\n<li><strong>Be Proactive With Invoicing</strong> – if you generally leave your invoicing until the end of the month, get the money in earlier by invoicing promptly. Make it easy for clients to settle their invoices by BACS, Direct Debit etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Set Your Own Payment Terms</strong> – with new clients or one-off jobs negotiate more favourable payment terms for the Christmas holiday.</li>\n<li><strong>Conduct A Credit Check Against New Clients </strong>– unfortunately it can only take one bad debt to seriously upset your business finances, so although new custom will be welcome during a slow period it’s wise to make sure they are creditworthy.</li>\n<li><strong>Chase Late Payments </strong>– with potentially more time on your hands (or staff with a reduced workload) there’s no reason to allow debtors to fall behind. Put a plan in place to chase outstanding payments and ensure you’ve banked all money owed.</li>\n<li><strong>Review Your Banking Requirements</strong> – have a look at whether you could be getting a better deal on borrowing or charges elsewhere. Speak to your bank to see whether they can recommend ways or products that can help reduce your banking costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce Stock </strong>– keep your stock at a minimum so you are not paying out unnecessarily for items you are unlikely to shift. Old lines may benefit from being put on sale: take advantage of Black Friday (28 November), Cyber Monday (1 December) if your product lends itself to pre-Christmas sales, or Boxing Day where once again record numbers of people are expected to take advantage of sales on the High Street and online.</li>\n<li><strong>Take A Holiday</strong> – many employers give staff the days in between Christmas and New Year as holiday. This may seem like a generous gesture but it may also make financial sense. Although the cost savings of closing your premises may not cover your staffing bill, they can contribute to some savings. And if staff are not working at capacity anyway, it may be the best route for your business.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Relationships With Clients And Suppliers</strong> – spread some seasonal cheer by taking the opportunity to build on your existing business relationships, so ensuring that you have the foundations for a successful 2015. Whether you send cards or gifts, make an effort to thank them for their business and support over the past 12 months.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, if you are currently rushed off your feet fulfilling Christmas orders you’ll appreciate a rest in the New Year but don’t spend your earnings all at once! For businesses that rely on Christmas for a boost in their income, and those who also benefit from the New Year sales, financial planning for the rest of the year is crucial to make sure you are ready for Christmas 2015.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black &amp; White Accounting</a> we want our clients to make a success of their business and this can only start with sound financial planning.

      "content": "<p>We’ve all read articles about common accounting mistakes, in fact there are so many out there you might expect everyone to be wise to these errors. But for one reason or another people still make them and therefore, at the risk of clogging up the Internet with even more dos and don’ts, here are the 5 accounting mistakes I would like to see banished to Room 101.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Why Do People Make These Accounting Mistakes?</strong></p>\n<p>Before sharing my top five, let’s consider why business owners make these accounting blunders. I would surmise that many are a result of a hang up from previous accounting systems, before the business started to grow. Generally these are made in an attempt to reduce costs, but if they result in an incorrect tax return they could cost you instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #1 – Mixing personal and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/why-diy-accounting-is-dangerous/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"216\">business expenses</a></strong></p>\n<p>My first no-no is common with many self-employed individuals. You start <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">working in a freelance capacity</a> with minimal expenses and business overheads. Invoices to clients pretty much equate to a salary after you’ve paid tax and NI contributions. Because there is no legal reason for a self-employed <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader to open a separate bank account</a>, money can be paid into a personal account: the one that household expenses are paid from.</p>\n<p>This works perfectly well when the freelancer does not have many work-related outgoings. But problems occur when work changes. For example, perhaps a new project involves some additional outlay, or the client requires you to buy in materials or stock and invoice them for this. Whether it’s a one-off or a gradual <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-easy-is-it-to-change-accountants/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"120\">change in accounting</a> the self-employed individual finds themselves managing more business expenses through their personal bank account.</p>\n<p>This increased volume is what creates problems and potential error as you are forced to reconcile both your business and personal expenses. It also makes it more difficult for you to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">hand over your accounts to a bookkeeper</a> or accountant, as you are the only one who knows what is business and what is pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #2 – Doing it all yourself</strong></p>\n<p>Filing an annual tax return is not difficult if your accounts are fairly straightforward. If you’re earning a modest amount with few expenses and variables, DIYing is a viable thing to do. However, as your business grows and your offering changes your accounts may not be quite as straightforward, and here you could benefit from some outside help.</p>\n<p>Remember that although it will cost you to get an accountant to do this job for you, it can save you money too; and of course time. Instead delegate this job to someone who can help reduce your tax and free up your time to concentrate on other areas of your business.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #3 – Don’t hire family or friends</strong></p>\n<p>Keeping business in the family is great if your family (or friends) have the right skills, qualifications and attributes to do the job required. But just getting your spouse to do the books because it’s a cheap solution can cause personal and professional problems.</p>\n<p>Even if your friend or family member is qualified to do your accounts, be wary of favours and “mates rates”. Even with the best of intentions your friend may struggle to prioritise your accounts over their higher paying clients, and therefore you might not be getting such a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">great service</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #4 – Not keeping receipts</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s another reason you shouldn’t mix your business and personal accounts: receipts. If you’re guilty of having receipts stuffed in your wallet, handbag or pocket and no idea whether they are business expenses or your weekly supermarket shop, it’s time to get organised! Losing receipts costs you money. Without them you cannot claim for expenses you have incurred through your business. The solution is simple. Separate your finances so you have a dedicated business account (for the self-employed this can still be a personal bank account) and use your “business account” exclusively for that. Keep an envelope in your car / bag to put all business receipts in and weekly, or monthly, go through and file them.</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to store paper copies a digital scan/photo of both sides of the receipt is allowable, and if you are using Xero, or any other Cloud accounting system, you can attribute the receipt to the relevant expense online.</p>\n<p><strong>Accounting Mistake #5 – Not keeping an eye on the VAT threshold</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, another accounting mistake that is common with start-ups and the self-employed – not registering for VAT. Currently the VAT registration threshold stands at £81,000, this is based on your VAT taxable turnover – the total value of everything you sell or supply that isn’t VAT exempt. What people often forget is this is a rolling 12-month threshold, not based on your tax year. Therefore, you could find that an invoice dated for December pushes you over the threshold in the period December 2013 to December 2014. Checking your rolling turnover regularly is essential, especially if you are close to the threshold.</p>\n<p>I think the overriding lesson to be learnt from all these accounting mistakes is to be professional about your accounts from the start. However, all is not lost if you have started off on the wrong foot. An accountant can help you consolidate your accounts and put in place systems to enable you to manage your accounts efficiently.</p>\n<p>If you would like to speak to a member of the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black &amp; White</a> team about your accounts, tax returns or VAT, please get in touch.

There are three main professional qualifications that are awarded by professional bodies, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en.html\">ACCA – Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</a> – offers the ACCA Qualification, which focuses on business issues.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.icaew.com/en/qualifications-and-programmes/aca\">ACA – The Associate Chartered Accountant</a> – the professional qualification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales (ICAEW).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cimaglobal.com\">CIMA – The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Professional Qualification in Management Accounting</a> – specialises in accounting for business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Look for the term “chartered accountant” or “certified accountant”, and then the professional body they are registered with. As you can see some of these bodies award more specialist qualifications, for example CIMA, and therefore when looking for an accountant you need to find one who has relevant qualifications and experience for your business needs.</p>\n<p>Here at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black &amp; White</a> we are Chartered Certified Accountants regulated by ACCA, which focuses on business accountancy issues. Accountants who are registered with a professional body, are not only qualified but they also have to maintain their skills and knowledge through continued professional development (CPD). This means that they are update with changes to legislation, development of ethical practices and HMRC. They also have to have professional indemnity insurance in place and, should you not be happy with the service you receive, the professional body are responsible for the regulation and the discipline of its members.</p>\n<p><strong>Look For An Accountant With Relevant Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Having identified accountancy companies who have the appropriate qualifications and are members of a professional body, we would advise you to find out whether they have any practical experience in your sector or with your particular business model.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-start-ups/\">Business start-ups</a> have very different accounting needs to large corporations, and so it makes sense to use a company who understand your requirements. This will also have an implication on cost. For example accountants who work with self-employed individuals will appreciate that you may not want to outsource all your accounting needs in the interest of saving money, and will help you to achieve a balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Accounting</strong></p>\n<p>To this end it is also worth seeing whether an accountancy firm have embraced cloud accounting. Software like <a href=\"https://www.xero.com\">Xero</a> enables accountant and businesses to have instant access to the accounts, and allows both parties to collaborate on them. This can save both time and money.</p>\n<p><strong>Talk To Them About Fees</strong></p>\n<p>Typically accountancy fees are either a fixed fee, variable or a combination of the two. It is very important to have a conversation about fees from the offset and to find an accountant who offers the ideal financial package for you. This also includes payment terms. The good news is accountancy fees are tax deductible!</p>\n<p><strong>Be Specific About What You Want</strong></p>\n<p>When speaking to a potential accountant about your business and finances, be really clear on what you hope to achieve. Are you just <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">looking for someone to do your tax returns</a>, or do you want financial advice too? Any reputable accountant will be transparent about the level of their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">services</a> and whether they can provide what you are looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Recommendations!</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, a great way to find an accountant is to ask for recommendations, particularly if you are looking for a local firm. Speak to friends and family, or ask other business owners in your area and find out what their experience has been. You can also ask the accountant for testimonials and recommendations; we’re always happy to provide these, give us a call if you like!</p>\n",

Today we delivered a presentation to members of the Institute of Directors on Auto-Enrolment, but it is important to acknowledge the elephant in the room; the UK&#8217;s future lies outside the EU.</p>\n<p><!--more--><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/auto-enrolment-pension-rates/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"27\">Auto Enrolment</a> is one of the biggest current opportunities for accountants, with over 570,000 small companies reaching their staging date over the next 12 months. However, only 3% of those surveyed by Pension PlayPen self-identified themselves as accountants, with the largest single group being Financial Advisors, at 51%. So why are Accountants missing out on this opportunity?</p>\n<h2>What is Auto Enrolment?</h2>\n<p>In a world of ageing populations and budget deficits, the emphasis is shifting from state pensions and provisions onto the individual and their employer.</p>\n<p>Auto Enrolment is a Government initiative making employers legally required to help employees save for retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Employees need to be enrolled on a scheme if: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are aged between 22 and state pension age</li>\n<li>Earning more than £10,000 a year and</li>\n<li>Working in the UK.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every company who has a PAYE scheme with eligible employees is obliged to register a pension scheme, and if it is not done by the staging date there will be an automatic penalty of £400.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that even when no employees appear to be eligible, it is still necessary for a pension scheme to be in place in advance of the staging date, in case employees are eligible at a later date.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum employer contributions are qualifying earnings of: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1% until September 2017</li>\n<li>2% October 2017 until September 2018</li>\n<li>3% October 2018+</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Different types of contracts </strong></p>\n<p>We note that the process is similar for both temporary and permanent staff, with even zero hours contracts potentially eligible.</p>\n<p><strong>Opt-out </strong></p>\n<p>Eligible employees can opt-out and current opt-out levels are estimate to be 10-12%, the key is for the employees to have the choice. The majority of our Director-only clients have already been opted out as they seek to make personal arrangements instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Postponements </strong></p>\n<p>This is an additional flexibility for employees to postpone for a period of up to three months. Our clients are generally opting to do this as it gives them more time. This can take place from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The employer’s stage date</li>\n<li>The employees first day of employment</li>\n<li>When employee becomes eligible</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Qualifying Schemes </strong></p>\n<p>The pension scheme must meet certain minimum standards. There are literally thousands of options here, each of which offers different rates and ongoing costs.</p>\n<p>We offer our clients two solutions, one which is payable by the employer annually and one which is “free” to the employer as the fee is taken from the employee funds. They fully integrate into our payroll software.</p>\n<p>The Government schemes, such as NEST and NOW appear to be popular as they are also “free” to the employer, but from what we have heard, they are proving to be an administrative nightmare.</p>\n<p>To find out more get in touch with us if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your existing payroll provider doesn’t have a solution</li>\n<li>You have clients, without a solution yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are available on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

Not necessarily.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’ve paid a large enough amount of rent to a landlord, which is quite possible if you’re leasing a large commercial property, you could owe HMRC stamp duty. Our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax advisers</a> take you through when you may have to pay and how much you could owe. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Ignorance is no defence</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Many tenants are unaware of their tax obligation and, since the end of 2003, the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/stamp-duty-and-land-tax/\">responsibility for paying stamp duty</a> rests with you, the tenant. If you don’t comply, you could receive a fine from HMRC.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is stamp duty and why do we have to pay it?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax-calculator/\">Stamp duty is a tried and trusted way for government to raise tax revenue</a> whenever certain legal documents are officially ratified. In the case of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-ated-and-stamp-duty-land-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">stamp duty land tax (SDLT)</a>, whenever a property is bought, the tax is paid by the buyer to cover official legal costs for transferring the ownership title of the property and making a search to make sure you’re buying from the legal owner.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So what’s SDLT got to do with renting?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Most people only associate stamp duty with buying and selling houses but if the cumulative rent that a tenant pays during the total length of their tenancy exceeds a threshold figure, they must also pay stamp duty at the rate of 1% on any amount above that threshold.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Paying Stamp Duty on rental properties is not as bad as it sounds</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For residential properties, that threshold is £125,000 while for commercial lets, the 1% threshold is £50,000. There is also a 2% SDLT rate for rental costs that exceed £5 million.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To put things in perspective, if the cumulative rent payments over the period of your tenancy of an office comes to £200,000, you will pay 1% on the £50,000 excess, or £500. If the cost of your lease is below £50,000 then you’re exempt altogether.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In fact, the most painful part of the process may be the fines HMRC levy for non-payment, so check your rental agreement and, when your tenancy period is coming to an end, make sure you have all the correct receipts to hand and factor in the extra tax. If keeping track of all of your payments and incomes is proving too difficult, consider <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">outsourcing your book keeping</a> to a certified accountant.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any doubts about what taxes you should be paying, then contact <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Black and White Accounting</a> or call one of our tax experts on 0800 140 4644.

This can open up a whole new minefield of tax obligations and benefits which could take a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax accountant</a> to help clear for you. Here&#8217;s our advice on childcare business expenses.</span></p>\n<h2>Are Nursery Fees and Childcare Tax Deductible?</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re one of those entrepreneurs who’s paying for a nursery place in order to free up time to work on your business, you may be recording all of your nursery costs to claim as legitimate business expenses. Unfortunately, nursery fees aren&#8217;t legitimate business expenses and aren’t tax deductible.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you at risk of prosecution?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though child care eats into your profits, as far as the taxman is concerned, nursery fees paid by a sole trader aren’t exclusively for the purpose of your business, so they’re not tax deductible. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At Black and White Accounting we’re concerned that many <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> could be falling foul of tax regulations because of this misunderstanding, putting themselves at risk of prosecution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>However, the taxman can help you</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paying for childcare is a real issue for the parents going self-employment. However, there are ways to get help with child care costs, so keep hold of your receipts.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Child tax credits</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a sole trader, if you’re income is low enough and you work enough hours, you may meet the criteria to apply through the Working Tax Credit system for help with your child care costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tax-free Childcare</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From 21</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>st</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> April 2017, the government introduced a new scheme called Tax-free Childcare, under which parents can apply for payments to cover 20% of their childcare costs. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s called the Tax-free Childcare Scheme because this is effectively a tax rebate for anyone who pays the basic 20% band of income tax.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Parents pay money into an account with a childcare voucher provider and the government will top it up, so if you put £80 into your account, the government puts in another £20.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The government contributes up to a maximum of £2,000 per year per child, or up to £4,000 if the child is disabled.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The scheme covers the whole UK and is open to parents of children under the age of 12, or under 16 if they’re disabled. The scheme will be expanded to include children up to the age of 12 by the end of this year. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To be eligible for Tax-free Childcare, you must:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Be working, and if you have a partner they must be working too. However, if your partner can’t work because they’re disabled or caring for a disabled person, you are still eligible.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Be employed or self-employed basis and have an income of at least £120 per week, though an exception is made for a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-start-ups/\">business start-up</a> period.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not earn more than £100,000 a year, neither must a partner.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can apply by setting up an account on the government’s <a href=\"https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk/\"><span class=\"s4\">childcare choices website.</span></a> If you have problems with your Tax-Free Childcare account, call the childcare service helpline on 0300 123 4097.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What if I’m in another scheme?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re already using Employer Supported Childcare schemes, you can continue using it but you can’t use both childcare vouchers and Tax-free Childcare together.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you get tax relief on the costs of childcare at a workplace nursery, this won’t change.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can’t use the Tax-free Childcare Scheme if you’re already receiving Tax Credits.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Need more advice?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re working for yourself, you’ll have your own unique circumstances, so if you’d like more advice about your tax liability and how the Government could be helping you, contact <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Black and White Accounting</a> on 0800 140 4644.</span></p>\n",

If you set up in business on, say, on 1 March 2017, your first trading year ended on 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> April 2017, so 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> October 2017 is in your second year of trading and it’s your deadline to declare the fact to HMRC.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if you started self-employment in August 2017, your first trading year ends on 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> April 2018, so you have until 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> October 2018 to tell HMRC.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, you can register with HMRC at any time before these dates and there’s no advantage in putting it off &#8211; you’re just more likely to forget, in which case you could face a fine or prosecution because you’re not paying <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">tax on your income</a>. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why do I need to declare that I’m self-employed?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You are responsible for paying tax and National Insurance on your self-employed income. For HMRC to calculate how much you owe, you need to fill in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax return</a> form<a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\"> SA100</a>, recording all of your earnings and expenses for the year. HMRC will allocate you a 10-digit Unique Taxation Reference and you can set up an online account to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">file your tax returns</a> and pay what’s due via the internet.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Am I self-employed?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There are lots of terms to describe the self-employed: <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a>, contractor, partner, trader, but you’re considered self-employed if you sell services or products for a profit, taking full responsibility for your venture’s success or failure. You aren’t paid through PAYE, and you don&#8217;t have the employment rights and responsibilities of employees.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">You may employ other people but it’s not necessary. You may also be working with a business partner, in which case both of you must register with HMRC as self-employed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">You can be both employed and self-employed at the same time, for example if you work for an employer during the day and run your own business part time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Self-employment can include trading goods directly, by mail or over the internet. Even selling at a car boot sale counts if you do it regularly and for profit. However, selling a few unwanted items on eBay probably doesn’t count, but you should seek advice. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Strangely, if you own a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> you’re not classed as self-employed by HMRC because you’re considered to be both an owner and employee of your company.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re not sure whether what you do counts as self-employment then contact <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/income-tax-enquiries-for-self-employed\"><span class=\"s4\">HMRC</span></a> for advice.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do I register for self-assessment?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">You must visit the HMRC website to <span class=\"s4\">register as self-employed</span>. You need to give them your personal details and decide on a trading name for your business, which must follow some basic, common sense rules. There is more advice about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/set-up-sole-trader\"><span class=\"s4\">naming your business</span></a> on the website.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>National Insurance – for now</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">As a sole trader you currently need to pay Class 2 NI Contributions (NIC) on your income, £2.85 a week, unless your profits are less than £6,025 a year. However, Class 2 NIC will be abolished in April 2018 so you won’t have to worry about them after that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">Self-employed workers also need to pay Class 4 NICs. For the tax year 2017/18 you pay nothing on annual profits below £8,164, 9% on profits up to £45,000 and 2% on any profits above £45,000.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do I need to register for VAT?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">You must register for VAT if your business has an annual turnover of £85,000 or more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If in doubt seek expert advice</b></span></p>\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-fiqxt-79elbk h-full\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-fiqxt-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col text-sm gizmo:pb-9 dark:bg-gray-800 gizmo:dark:bg-transparent\">\n<div class=\"w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 bg-gray-50 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-[#444654] gizmo:dark:bg-transparent\" data-testid=\"conversation-turn-27\">\n<div class=\"p-4 gizmo:py-2 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 gizmo:gap-3 gizmo:md:px-5 gizmo:lg:px-1 gizmo:xl:px-5 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] gizmo:md:max-w-3xl gizmo:lg:max-w-[40rem] gizmo:xl:max-w-[48rem] xl:max-w-3xl } group final-completion\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gizmo:w-full lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)] agent-turn\">\n<div class=\"flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full gap-3 gizmo:gap-0\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message peer flex flex-col items-start gap-3 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words peer-[.text-message]:mt-5 overflow-x-auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"cdcee049-eca3-411b-98c6-c637c1c6c7dd\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<p>For personalized advice on taxation, National Insurance, and VAT tailored to your unique circumstances, it&#8217;s recommended to consult with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">qualified self-assessment accountant</a>.

But while you’re buying your last minute presents or carving the turkey on Christmas Day, is there a niggling thought that you should be doing something important?</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, ‘tis the season for completing your 2016-17 self-assessment tax return and making payment of any tax due before the 31 January deadline.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether you’re an experienced owner/manager of a small to medium sized enterprise (SME), a sole trader facing <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your first tax return</a>, or a retiree with multiple forms of income, it’s always tempting to put the chore off until the last minute. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, like many chores, it’s never as bad as it seems and you’ll get a warm pre-Christmas glow when you’ve hit the “submit” button and the job’s done.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, we like to help people with their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>, so here are our seasonal thoughts on the subject.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Who needs to complete a self-assessment tax return?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re an employee on Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and with no other sources of income, you don’t need to worry about <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment</a> forms. However, if you have any other income, perhaps from a buy-to-let property, bank interest or dividends from investments, then you must submit a tax return. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For more information, you can refer to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/who-must-send-a-tax-return\">Gov website</a> for Self Assessment Tax Returns. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many of our customers are SME owners or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> and they all have to declare their earnings so that HMRC can work out how much tax they owe each year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Congratulations, you’re paying more tax – now get an accountant</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you suspect your tax bill is going to be significant this year, then well done &#8211; it looks like your business is really taking off and you’re making money.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In that case, it&#8217;s time to hand over to an accountant. You may not like the idea of paying for a professional accountant but here are a few things to consider:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A good accountant can save you more than they cost;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your time is valuable and better spent making money, not digging out old receipts;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">You have peace of mind knowing the job is done in plenty of time and correctly; and</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">An accountant has a wealth of business experience and can advise you on your business strategy.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We pride ourselves on the long term relationships we build with our clients, getting to know their businesses inside out so we can offer a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">full range of business services</a>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Filing your tax return late</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last year, seven per cent of self-assessment tax payers, that’s 840,000 people, were late submitting returns. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If, for some compelling reason such as a computer failure or a personal tragedy, you do miss the 31 January deadline, contact HMRC as soon as possible and explain your circumstances. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HMRC deals with appeals on a case-by-case basis and we find they can be reasonable so long as you communicate. The thing to avoid is putting off the problem in the hope that it disappears; this just leads to a bigger fine:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">£100 penalty for the first 3 months;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">5% of tax due if more than 30 days late;</span></li>\n<li>£10 penalty per day, if more than 3 months late (£900 max)</li>\n<li>5% of tax due if more than 6 months late, or £300 if greater</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230;and it just gets worse!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">31 January is also the deadline for paying tax and if you’re more than 30 days late with that, you’ll be charged 5% interest and could face court action – that’s a letter from HMRC no one wants to receive. Don&#8217;t wait for that brown envelope to come through the door!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if you’ve already missed the 31 October deadline for posting your paper tax return, do not send it in late and incur a fine. There’s still time to register for self-assessment online to meet the 31 January electronic deadline.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Filing online</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you haven’t converted already to using HMRCs online tax platform, we’d recommend you do so, for a number of reasons:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">More time to send in your return;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instant <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">tax calculation</a> before you hit the “submit” button;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Work on your return over a period of time, collecting the information you need;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mistakes are easy to correct; and</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make corrections to previous tax returns.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To set up a self-assessment account online, register on the <span class=\"s3\">HMRC website</span>. For this you need your unique tax reference, a ten-digit number you can find on any letter from HMRC, and to answer a few basic questions about you and your business.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Would you like some help meeting the self-assessment tax deadline?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No one wants to be a Scrooge: we all have to pay our fair share of taxes if we want to enjoy the services we expect in a civilised society. But there’s no need to pay more than the government asks for. </span>If the looming self-assessment tax deadline is causing stress, consider reaching out to Black and White Accounting for professional assistance; as an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">experienced local self-assessment accountant</a> can help ensure a smooth and timely submission, allowing you to enjoy the festive season with peace of mind.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you feel that you or your business is at the right stage for you to hand over the accounts, and the stress, to a professional, then, please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s3\">contact Black and White Accounting</span></a> or ring 0800 140 4644.</span></p>\n",

We started with an office party at our Herriard HQ, with Secret Santa, sandwiches and cake and everyone wearing the obligatory Christmas jumper to raise money for our favourite charity. The day raised £80 for Save the Children.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">And the fun just continued; we then channelled our inner child for a trip to the panto. We saw Peter Pan in Basingstoke before b</span><span class=\"s1\">umping into the entire cast in the pub afterwards, so we spent the rest of the evening having a giggle with them. It was all a great change from the usual (grown-up) dinner and drinks we’ve had in the past.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The day was also a chance to welcome Zonay to the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White</a> team, which has now expended to seven permanent members and seven sub-contractors. I hope Zonay doesn’t expect this every week.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Employee party tax allowance – the conditions</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We may not have seen Pinocchio at the panto but he’s not the only thing with strings attached. HMRC’s seasonal generosity for office parties also comes with a few conditions:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The party must be an annual event, so you’re going to have to promise one next year too.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The party must be for all employees, so you can’t use the allowance to reward your top performing team.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The allowance is for any annual staff party, so you could have a Halloween do, or an Eid feast after Ramadan instead, or as well, so long as the cumulative total for the year comes in at less than £150 per attendee. </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The money isn’t an expenses claim. If you spend more than £150 per person on parties, you can’t claim any of it back. Simply divide the total cost by the number of attendees to find out whether you can claim.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The majority of the people attending must be employees, but they can bring guests, who you can include when you’re claiming against tax. </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs includes everything to make the party go with a swing, including food, drink and entertainment. If you’re not into parties, it even covers trips out, perhaps go-karting, paintballing or a visit to the panto.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">We’re looking forward to a Christmas break but we’ll be back in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">office</a> on Tuesday 2nd January 2018, when we’</span><span class=\"s1\">ll be gearing up for a busy month, especially with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax returns</a> due for our smaller businesses and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">sole traders tax returns</a>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To help our clients, we&#8217;ve streamlined our systems and procedures and introduced E-signers to ensure January is as painless as possible.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But until then, we wish all our clients, and our amazing staff, a merry Christmas and a happy new year!</span></p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The 31 January deadline is fast approaching for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">submitting self-assessment tax returns</a> and paying income tax and National Insurance owed to HMRC.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the vast majority of us, and certainly, for all of my <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">accounting and tax</a> clients, the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">annual completion of tax returns</a> is an affirmation of integrity and honesty. Few people enjoy paying their taxes but we generally recognise it’s a price worth paying for living in a civilised society.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And yet HMRC calculates that deliberate fraud costs the taxpayer around £11.5 billion in evaded tax every year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, our duty is to ensure our clients only pay the tax that’s legally due and, if they plan to make any decision that could have tax implications, we ensure they have the full facts before they take it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, our duty does not stretch to doing anything we consider dishonest, unethical or illegal.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Professional accounting ethics</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We are members of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA)</span><span class=\"s2\"> which has a <span class=\"s3\">code of ethics and conduct</span> </span><span class=\"s4\">that is binding on all members. Its five fundamental principles are:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s4\">Integrity</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s4\">Objectivity</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s4\">Professional competence and due care</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s4\">Confidentiality – except where there is a legal duty to disclose information</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s4\">Complying with relevant laws.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, while we always respect our client confidentiality, <strong>all accountants are required to report illegal activity to the authorities</strong>. It is a corporate criminal offence to fail to prevent tax evasion, therefore we are obliged to report any suspicion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, the government has introduced legislation requiring professionals to declare <strong>historic tax evasion</strong>. Anyone who has not owned up to past evasion by 30 September 2018 could face new penalties.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is tax evasion?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While tax avoidance is not necessarily illegal, its ethics are often debated whenever a celebrity is caught in a scheme to reduce their tax liability in the UK. But tax evasion is a criminal act, covered by the Theft Act 1968. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tax evasion encompasses VAT, excise duty and NI, as well as income tax, and can lead to up to seven years in prison, a large fine or both.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to the National Criminal Intelligence Service, 60% of tax evasion requires accountant or solicitor participation, so HMRC is encouraging professionals to act as whistle blowers. The Taxes Management Act, 1970 imposes a duty on anyone knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of income tax by another person and covers solicitors and accountants and the employees of businesses.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tax evasion can include failure to declare all income, non-payment and deliberate under-paying of the tax due. A HMRC investigation may find that a genuine mistake has been made but the most serious level of tax fraud involves deliberately providing false documentation to HMRC to cover up a non-payment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tax evasion hotline</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A tax evasion hotline has also been set up to make it easier for anyone to report a suspicion of tax evasion to HMRC.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Make sure you’re paying the right tax</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Accountancy in the UK works to the highest professional and ethical standards and, if you’re open and honest about all income and expenses, you can enjoy the peace of mind of knowing you are paying the right amount of tax.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whether you require guidance on tax accuracy or seek to avoid HMRC scrutiny, Black and White Accounting, with its team of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">professional self-assessment accountant</a>s, stands ready to assist you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you would like more information to ensure your tax bill is correct and to avoid a visit by HMRC investigators, then please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">contact Black and White Accounting</span></a> or ring 0800 140 4644.</span></p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How many kings have been toppled, or bloody wars fought, because of income tax?</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I don’t mean that wars have been fought over income tax (though there has been the odd riot). I mean that many of history’s longest and bloodiest wars were only made possible because governments introduced levies on people’s incomes, primarily to pay for ships, weapons and men.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Ancient Greek tax rebates</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This trend started in ancient Athens, which imposed the eisphora on its free citizens in times of war. However, not only would those freedom loving Athenians repeal the eisphora when the fighting was done, they also refunded their tax payers out of the spoils of war.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The people who invented the term barbarian for foreigners also imposed a monthly poll tax on anyone who didn’t have two Athenian parents; one drachma for men and half a drachma for women. Xenophobic but also progressive?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In England before the modern era, kings and parliaments tended to tax things, such as wool, land, trade, even windows. And taxes were generally raised for specific purposes like relieving the deserving poor or equipping the navy, rather than for general running costs.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tax rebellions</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taxation has always been controversial; King Charles I lost his head after a civil war that started as a tax-raising dispute with parliament, and we lost 13 of our North American colonies over a tea tax, but <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">taxing personal wealth</a> was considered too intrusive and dangerous, especially since the poll tax rebellion of 1381. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But when war comes, governments face two “taxing” problems; wars are very expensive and they disrupt trade, which means there are fewer things to tax.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A temporary tax &#8211; honest</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That’s why, at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain’s Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, bit the bullet and introduced <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax</a> in 1799, purely as a temporary measure, mind.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The original income tax ranged from two old pennies in the pound (0.008%) on incomes over £60, to a maximum of 2 shillings (10%) for annual earnings of more than £200. He raised £6 million in 1799 which paid for the world’s largest navy and armies spread from the Caribbean to Egypt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The government was true to its word and abolished the tax in 1802 when the Peace of Amiens was agreed, although it was re-established briefly from 1803 to 1816 in order to finish off Napoleon Bonaparte once and for all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Only in 1842 was income tax as we know it introduced by Sir Robert Peel. All those great ideas for public services, like a police force and a postal service, had to be paid for somehow.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The USA followed suit in 1861 when their Congress imposed its first personal income tax, at the rate of three per cent for incomes over $800, to help pay for the American Civil War.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And there we have it; tax on income is probably here to stay, with just the occasional tweak; rates going up and down, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> being introduced at the birth of the welfare state and companies being moved out of the frying pan of income tax and into the fire of corporation tax in 1965.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Need help with your tax self-assessment?</b></span></h2>\n<p>For comprehensive assistance with self-assessment <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>, reach out to Black and White Accounting.

What if we are about to be targeted for Tax Enquiries!</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>If you haven’t already been targeted by HMRC for a tax enquiry you may dread the idea, but it need not be as bad as you imagine.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Tax Enquiries: Why me?</strong></h2>\n<p>Don’t worry, HMRC isn’t picking on you because they think you’ve done something wrong. Since 2009, businesses have been selected by an automated system which analyses returns.</p>\n<p>A proportion of enquiries are purely random, possibly to make sure that no-one feels too secure, but HMRC may also be using ratio analysis software to target companies that have filed figures that are significantly difference from historic records</p>\n<p>This may trigger an aspect enquiry, rather than a full inspection, to look at a particular aspect of your figures, for example unusually large expenses.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, there has been a significant increase in VAT, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax returns</a> and corporation <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax enquiries</a> since the system was brought in, after the coalition government pledged to clamp down on tax cheats to reduce the black hole in its public spending.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this has resulted in an increase in costs and inconvenience for business.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tax Enquiries: What happens during an investigation?</strong></h2>\n<p>HMRC has powers to enter and search premises. A team will take away all your records for examination and may then come back with questions, so you will need your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">accountant on hand</a> to answer any detailed queries.</p>\n<p>Since self-assessment and online returns have been brought in, HMRC has an increased amount of information at its fingertips, which means the number of issues the taxman can raise is increasing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tax Enquiries: What if there’s a problem?</strong></h2>\n<p>Hopefully, HMRC won’t fine anything wrong, because you’ve kept careful accounts and you have a diligent and professional accountant helping you. However, even in this best case scenario, you will put up with weeks of worry, waiting for the enquiry to be completed.</p>\n<p>If the enquiry does find a problem, a company can be fined up to 100% of the tax they should have paid. However, if HMRC judges that you’ve made a genuinely honest mistake, this can be reduced.</p>\n<p>Although only the latest year’s accounts are normally inspected, if the taxman finds evidence of deliberate deceit or fraud, inspectors may go back another five years into your records, with all the inconvenience, lost time and expense that incurs. That’s why yo need to keep accounting records for at least five years and VAT records for six years.</p>\n<h2>What are VAT inspections?</h2>\n<p>VAT officers can also visit your business to inspect VAT records to make sure you’re paying or reclaiming the right amount.<br />\nAlthough the taxman can visit without making an appointment, or ring up with a query, they usually gives you seven days’ notice before a visit and will confirm what information they want to see and whether they need to inspect your premises. You do have the right to request they delay a visit.</p>\n<p>During the visit, if inspectors find a problem they will work with you to correct it as well as inform you of any additional tax you owe or penalty you have to pay.</p>\n<p>After the visit, HMRC will write to you to confirm measures to take to improve your VAT record keeping; any corrections you must make to your VAT account; if you’re overpaying or underpaying your VAT and any penalty you have to pay. You have the right to appeal an HMRC decision within 30 days.</p>\n<h2>What can I do to avoid Tax Enquiries?</h2>\n<p>While there are no guarantees you can avoid a tax query, there are measures you can take to reduce the odds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep good accounts. An accountant can only work with what you give them.</li>\n<li>Don’t be late filing returns</li>\n<li>Make sure you highlight any problems or significant differences in your figures on the tax return form.</li>\n<li>Never keep anything from your accountant; treat them like a business partner and they will be able to help you make tax filing as painless as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your first and most important step to reducing the chances of a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-enquiry-contact-page/\">tax enquiry</a> is to get on board with a professional and diligent accountant who has a good track record with HMRC.</p>\n<p>To minimise the risk of tax enquiries, maintaining meticulous records and timely filing are crucial. Having a professional and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">diligent self-assessment accountant</a>, like those at Black and White Accounting, can significantly reduce the likelihood of issues.

Many people look on professional accountancy and book keeping services as a cost burden and see DIY accounting as an instant saving.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>However, if you have the right accountant, you should consider them as an investment. Getting rid of them to do your own accounts could cost you pain, grief and money in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Are you claiming for every business expense?</h2>\n<p>Whenever someone tells me they’re getting a relative or a spouse to do their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">book keeping</a> and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax return</a> for them, it fills me with dread.</p>\n<p>Now, I do have some clients that this works well for, but is your relative or spouse going to know tax legislation and case law inside out and be aware of every business expense or allowance you can claim for? Probably not, in which case you could be paying much more tax than you’re saving through DIY accounting.</p>\n<p>Even if they have a good grasp of this, tax is ever changing and you need to keep up to date!</p>\n<h2><strong>Staying under the radar</strong></h2>\n<p>A bigger danger is if your amateur accountant fails to fill in the right boxes or puts the wrong information in the wrong place. You could attract unwanted attention from HMRC, which could lead to a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-enquiry-contact-page/\">tax enquiry</a>.</p>\n<p>If they get really excited they may even delve into your last 20 years of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> and that can seriously make your life difficult.</p>\n<h2>DIY accounting takes up your time</h2>\n<p>There are only so many hours in the day, accounting and tax returns can be completed and if you are not a specialist, and only do them once a year, it can be very onerous on your time, not to mention stressful. Ask yourself whether this is the best use of your time?</p>\n<p>There are better tools and software now available, so you can do more yourself &#8211; but they are not necessarily the answer. Your time has a cost to it. It might simply be cheaper to get someone else to do these jobs for you!</p>\n<h2>DIY Accountants miss out on proactive advice</h2>\n<p>As an accountant, when we look at someone&#8217;s accounts or tax returns, it is a unique look into their world. We can use that to identify opportunities to grow your top line and reduce costs, in order to grow your bottom line. We can ensure you are getting the right structure, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-planning-and-structuring-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">identify tax planning opportunities</a> and help ensure you are set up for the future.</p>\n<h2>The impact of Making Tax Digital on DIY Accounting Requirements</h2>\n<p>More and more of our dealings with HMRC are done online. While HMRC thinks this is being helpful, going online doesn’t suit everybody, especially if you’ve been using <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">paper forms</a> for years.</p>\n<p>Things are going to get even more complicated when <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mtd-is-here/\">Making Tax Digital</a> is rolled out, requiring filing every quarter. Even when your long-suffering relative or spouse is IT-literate, will they want to spend even more time working on your books?</p>\n<p>Even if they are able to embrace the change and utilise cloud-based software they still won&#8217;t be specialists and it takes time to complete the learning curve of software.</p>\n<p><strong>Call in the professional accountants</strong></p>\n<p>I’m pretty sure you didn’t set up your own business so you could spend more time in the office going through receipts. I’m even more certain that you don’t want more stress in your life.</p>\n<p>So why not let an accountant take the weight off your shoulders. A good one will pay their way through savings and sound business advice, so you can focus on what you do best.</p>\n<p>Treat your accountant like your secret business partner, not a cost burden, and you will reap the rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>The next step</strong></p>\n<p>To find out how we can tailor our accounting services to your business&#8217;s needs and budget, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contact Black and White Accounting</a> today, or ring us today on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

Yet many businesses are acting as if <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/making-tax-digital-starts/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"58\">Making Tax Digital</a> (MTD) has been kicked into the long grass!</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Tax Return Accountants</a>, we thought it was time to have an update on HMRC’s campaign to make us all <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">file our tax returns online</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>A slow roll-out for MTD</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s true, MTD is slow in coming. HMRC’s <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"143\">plans to become the most digitally advanced tax</a> administration in the world has taken a bit of a knock thanks to the extra workload placed upon staff by BREXIT and delays in having the technology in place to impose MTD! HMRC announced earlier this year that the aspiration to transfer completely to MTD by 2020 won’t happen.</p>\n<p><strong>However, there are several reasons why businesses should not ignore MTD.</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, anything that makes life easier and cheaper for HMRC will probably happen sooner or later! After all, MTD is still due to be rolled out for all <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">VAT registered businesses</a> with turnover over the VAT threshold for April 2019, and for income tax, and Corporation tax from April 2010.</p>\n<p>Secondly, MTD offers a number of advantages that businesses should embrace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying quarterly avoids a big lump sum sitting in your accounts for long periods, and the temptation to spend it.</li>\n<li>MTD will help ensure every business keeps on top of its book keeping and accounting practices. (And, from our experience, that’s a good thing!)</li>\n<li>Businesses can enjoy the extra functionality of accounting software, especially Cloud-based packages, for producing real time financial information to support key decision making, what can be accessed anywhere in the world, with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>Doing things on a computer is quicker and easier, honestly!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The downside is that MTD will mean more frequent contact with HMRC, which can be scary, and will over time inevitably make new demands on business; Government initiatives often do!</p>\n<h2>What should I be doing to prepare for MTD?</h2>\n<p>The first thing to do is to adopt a change in behaviour. It will become important to stay on top of your book keeping if you’re to file returns every quarter, and maybe the days of customers coming in to the office with 12 months-worth of receipts will finally come to an end.</p>\n<p>Then you should be thinking about converting your current book keeping and accounting systems to a software package approved by HMRC. The government offers guidance <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t just mean recreating your hard copy ledgers onto an Excel spreadsheet. You need to choose and start using a professional accounting package such as <a href=\"https://www.xero.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xero</a>, <a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QuickBooks Online</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sage.com/en-gb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sage One</a>.

      "content": "<p>It’s taken three Autumn Statements from the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, so I bet Philip Hammond’s been bursting to make the announcement that austerity is coming to an end. With an economic forecast better than expected and receipts from taxes also increasing, the Chancellor was feeling confident enough to increase spending.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Even with Brexit looming ever closer, growth for 2019 is predicted to be 1.6%, an improvement on this year’s 1.3%. It’s predicted to be at 1.4% in 2020 and 2021 and then rise again in 2022 to 1.5%.</p>\n<p>I’m never entirely sure where the Treasury gets these figures from, however the belief that public finances are approximately £1.2bn better off than expected has let the Chancellor announce some significant new spending that could benefit businesses, public services and you as individuals.</p>\n<p>There is some positive news from the Autumn Statement, but I wouldn’t say it’s a vote winner, so it’s lucky the Government is in the middle of their current fixed term.</p>\n<p><strong>The Budget for individuals</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the highlights the Chancellor announced will affect us personally. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">income tax personal threshold allowance</a> will rise from £11,850 to £12,500 in April 2019. This is a year earlier than previously announced.</li>\n<li>The higher rate income tax threshold will rise from £46,350 to £50,000 in April.</li>\n<li>National living wage will increase from £7.83 to £8.21 an hour, an increase of 4.9%, from April 2019.</li>\n<li>For first time home buyers purchasing a shared ownership property, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-ated-and-stamp-duty-land-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">stamp duty</a> relief is rising from £300,000 to £500,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Budget for business</strong></p>\n<p>Highlights for businesses in the budget are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Businesses with a rateable value of £51,000 or under will have their bill cut by a third over a two-year period. This could lead to savings of up to £8,000.</li>\n<li>The retail sector has been finding times are hard, so the Chancellor’s announcement that £675 million of co-funding for local councils will go towards helping to plan the future of their high streets, may offer some ray of hope that they haven’t been</li>\n<li>Small businesses have had their contribution to the apprenticeship levy cut from 10% to 5%.</li>\n<li>The annual investment allowance to be increased to £1 million, from £200,000, for two years.</li>\n<li>VAT thresholds will remain at £85,000. This is significant as this threshold affects those who are affected by the Making Tax Digital rollout. There had been some speculation that the VAT threshold may be lowered, therefore requiring more businesses to register, but this hasn’t happened. Making Tax Digital comes into force from April 2019 for all VAT registered businesses with turnover above the £85,000 VAT threshold. For income tax, and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a>, it comes into effect in April 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other Budget highlights</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The NHS will receive an extra £20.5 billion over the next 5 years.</li>\n<li>Extra money has been set aside for Universal Credits. £1 billion over five years was announced to fund top-up payments for those transferring onto universal credit from other benefits.</li>\n<li>Work allowances, which is how much people can earn before they start to lose their benefits – will increase by £1,000 a year, giving some an extra £630 a year.</li>\n<li>Fuel duty has been frozen for the ninth year running.</li>\n<li>Schools budgets receive a one-off extra £400 million.</li>\n<li>Defence will receive £1bn to help build cyber capabilities and the Police an extra £160m for counter terrorism.</li>\n<li>An extra £500 million has been set aside for Brexit preparations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The budget has presented individuals and businesses with some positive news.

If undertaken successfully, it allows them to maintain control over those proceeds and, ultimately to provide a legitimate cover for their sources of income. Examples could include exploitative and violent crimes, including large scale drug dealing and people trafficking.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why is money laundering relevant to us as your professional advisers? </strong></h2>\n<p>By setting up a UK company for someone we could be providing legitimate cover. In addition, we are not just talking about the proceeds of gun-running, drug-trafficking or terrorism it’s the proceeds of any criminal activity. Defrauding the Revenue (or tax authorities in any jurisdiction) is a criminal activity so a client who comes to us for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">UK tax advice</a> may pay us with the proceeds of his business, which has been evading tax in another jurisdiction, and this would constitute a Money Laundering offence.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are our responsibilities? </strong></h3>\n<p>Before accepting instructions from a new client, we must be satisfied that you are not involved in any activity which is Money Laundering and that we will not be drawn into assisting you with Money Laundering. To protect ourselves we are required to put in place procedures to enable us to be satisfied in this respect.</p>\n<p>The procedures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before acting for a new client, we must obtain and retain satisfactory evidence of the new client’s identity. Where there is more than one person involved, we also must take reasonable measures to obtain evidence of that other person’s identity;</li>\n<li>We must maintain records of all transactions we undertake on your behalf;</li>\n<li>All new staff we employ, must be educated and trained on their responsibilities regarding the Money Laundering regulations, and existing staff must be provided with updates and regular refresher courses; and</li>\n<li>We must also have in place an internal reporting procedure for any suspicions of Money Laundering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the consequences of being involved in Money Laundering activities? </strong></h3>\n<p>Under the legislation it is a criminal offence to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conceal, disguise, convert or transfer another’s proceeds of criminal conduct &#8211; max penalty 14 years imprisonment and/or a fine.</li>\n<li>Assist another to retain the benefit of criminal conduct &#8211; max penalty 14 years imprisonment and/or a fine.</li>\n<li>Acquire, possess or use the proceeds of criminal conduct &#8211; max penalty 14 years imprisonment and/or a fine.</li>\n<li>To tip off in respect of a report of, or investigation into suspected Money Laundering &#8211; max penalty 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.</li>\n<li>In the case of drug trafficking and terrorism, to fail to report knowledge or suspicion of Money Laundering where that knowledge was acquired in the course of a trade, profession, business or employment &#8211; max penalty 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Money Laundering Reporting procedure </strong></h3>\n<p>Any suspicions must be reported to The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA).

The average claim value for SMEs in 2016-17 was £53,876.

Black and White accounting are here to provide you with the answers and help you r<a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">eclaim your tax</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who is eligible for R&amp;D tax credits?</strong></h2>\n<p>To qualify for R&amp;D tax relief, work must be part of a project to make advances in science or technology and must relate this to what the company does or intends to do based on the R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>Your business can be in any sector but you must be liable for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">UK Corporation tax</a> and have spent money on a qualifying R&amp;D project, which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Looks for an advance in science and technology;</li>\n<li>Shows you overcoming uncertainty;</li>\n<li>Explains how you are overcoming uncertainty; and/or</li>\n<li>Shows that the problem couldn’t be easily worked out by a professional in the field</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are still allowed to make a claim even if your research project isn’t successful.</p>\n<h3><strong>How much is the tax relief?</strong></h3>\n<p>The type of R&amp;D relief paid is dependant on the size of company. An SME (less than 500 staff and a turnover under €100 million or a balance sheet under €86m) can claim either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an extra 130% of their qualifying costs from their yearly profit, as well as the normal 100% deduction, to make a total 230% deduction; or</li>\n<li>claim a tax credit if the company is loss making, worth up to 14.5% of the surrenderable loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Large companies can claim R&amp;D Expenditure Credit of 12p for every £1 spent on qualifying R&amp;D expenditure from 1 January 2018 (11% of your qualifying R&amp;D expenditure up to 31 December 2017).</p>\n<h3><strong>How can you make a claim?</strong></h3>\n<p>Claims for R&amp;D tax credits can be made to HMRC through your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">Company Tax Return</a> and you can go as far back as two accounting periods. It normally takes four to six weeks for HMRC to process.</p>\n<p><strong>Will R&amp;D tax relief continue?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s estimated for every pound spent on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">R&amp;D tax credits</a>, between £1.53 and £2.35 is additionally spent on R&amp;D by UK companies and the continuing year on year increase in applications demonstrates the scheme’s popularity.</p>\n<p>However, the government has launched a consultation paper to consider capping R&amp;D tax relief to be paid to a qualifying loss-making business to minimise the impact to genuine business claims.</p>\n<p>That said, whilst we cannot anticipate future changes in legislation, these incentives are very good at encouraging investment, innovation and growth in the UK, which in a potentially post-Brexit world, could become even more key for our economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>\n<p>One of our client’s is an API-developer. They are in their infancy with high levels of investment to fund their growth and capability development. As a result of our support they were able to claim nearly £100,000 as a tax refund from HMRC during 2018, which is critical for their very survival. This is a great example of where R&amp;D tax credits can help innovation, investment and ultimately growth in the UK.</p>\n<h3><strong>Professional tax advice from Black and White Accounting</strong></h3>\n<p>Whilst there are some specialists in this area, they typically charge fees based on the reclaim amount, which can be as much as 20-40% of this amount plus VAT.

      "content": "<p>Nearly £1 trillion worth of housing in the UK is held as second homes by individuals or businesses and people are increasingly putting money into second properties, especially with a relaxing in the Pension rules.<!--more--></p>\n<p>One of the most frequently asked questions we get from clients is “What structure should I use for my Property Business?” i.e., if you have a buy-to-let property, or rental property business, should you hold it personally, hold it jointly with your partner (Partnership), through a Limited Liability Partnership, Investment Company, through a Pension Fund, or Trust.</p>\n<p>This has increasingly come up in conversations about <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax requirements</a> since the restriction of interest deductibility for individuals with property businesses.</p>\n<h2>A guide to business structures</h2>\n<h3><strong>Sole Trader</strong></h3>\n<p>As well as being the simplest (the property is in your personal name), most flexible (selling the property and realising the cash) and cheapest (both in terms of potential Accountants fees and lending costs), the Capital Gains Tax rate upon selling the property is also comparatively low at 2019/20: 18/28% (depending on your tax band), with the gain calculated as the proceeds from the house, less what you paid for the property and the annual exemption (2019/20: £12,000). If it is your only Property, you will also not pay the additional 3% <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-ated-and-stamp-duty-land-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Stamp Duty Land Tax (‘SDLT’)</a> rate.</p>\n<p>However, if you are a higher rate tax payer, you will pay 40%/45% (2019/20) on any income received from the property income each year, there is no limitation of liability, so you could lose everything you own if there are funding issues. Up until 2020 the level of deductibility of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mortgage-calculator/\">interest arising from mortgage</a> interest is being reduced, meaning ceteris paribus, the taxable profit will increase. Additionally, the property(ies) will constitute part of the individuals’ estate and whilst this limit is increasing for a spouse and their partner to £1m by 2020, any excess is taxed at 40% (2019/20) upon the death of the surviving spouse. The additional 3% of SDLT will also apply if you’ll own more than one residential property as a result.</p>\n<h3><strong>Partnership</strong></h3>\n<p>Very similar to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a>, the benefit of Partnerships over Sole Traders is you will have the annual exemption for each partner and potentially pay lower income tax as you will have more tax bands to fill up for the partners before you pay the 40%/45% potentially (2019/20).</p>\n<p>One of the first steps to reducing your tax liability could be to add your partner, wife or husband onto the deeds of the property. They can also be used as an interim structure before a portfolio of properties are transferred into an Investment Company (more below).</p>\n<p>Both Sole Traders and Partnerships suit a strategy of short-term property ownership with a view to making a capital gain, or very small portfolios where <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">individuals taxed</a> at basic rate.</p>\n<h3><strong>Limited Liability Partnerships (‘LLPs’)</strong></h3>\n<p>These are very similar to Partnerships, but they have the added benefit of limiting the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-liability-partnership-services/\">liability of any Partners/Members</a> to what assets they have left in the LLP. They are however more complicated, and the Accountant costs are likely to be higher as a result.</p>\n<h3><strong>Limited Company </strong></h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>, broadly speaking, is a legal structure for a business in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to their individual investment – this is known as limited liability.</p>\n<p>In the UK, limited companies are governed by the rules and regulations contained in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/contents\"><strong>Companies Act 2006</strong></a>, and all company registration and records are managed by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house\"><strong>Companies House</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>This is the one where there is often the most interest, but unfortunately one where the answer is often not simple.</p>\n<p>Here are the levels of tax on rental income: (2019/20: 19% <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a> versus up to 45% on income tax), if you have funding issues you could protect your personal assets due to limitation of liability and the distribution of shares can be a simpler and fairer way to give away your assets especially where there are properties in different locations, with different values.</p>\n<p>Selling the company as a whole, rather than as individual properties, can also lead to a higher selling price overall upon disposal and lower SDLT (2019/20: 0.5% versus up to 15%). If you retain any profits and reinvest these, it may also reduce the tax you pay and accelerate the growth of your property portfolio.</p>\n<p>However, lending is often harder to achieve and more expensive. Shares in a limited company form part of an individual’s estate for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/inheritance-tax/\">Inheritance Tax (‘IHT’)</a> purposes, Accountancy fees are often higher than sole trades and partnerships (although potentially lower than LLPs) and Entrepreneurs’ Relief is not available upon the sale of properties / company as it is not a trading business.</p>\n<p>Limited Companies tend to be suited if the strategy of the business is long-term retention of properties, with lower taxes meaning higher profits to make further acquisitions to grow the portfolio.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pension Funds</strong></h3>\n<p>Not only are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions/\">Pension Funds</a> potentially very tax efficient, they also help ensure that you have income and capital available for retirement. However, there are a lot of rules as to what Pension Funds can and cannot own (i.e., typically just commercial properties, which generally have a lower rental yield and therefore return on the investment), and there can be issues for inheritees.</p>\n<p>Often used where there is a significant portfolio of investments whose capital and income, owners want to enjoy in retirement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Trusts</strong></h3>\n<p>There are several different types of Trusts, but they are principally used to remove the property(ies) from the Estate for IHT. These are however special <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vehicles/\">vehicles</a> and as a result they are complicated, expensive to set up and depending on type you may have restrictions on what you can and can’t do with the capital and income.</p>\n<p>Used where the focus is around IHT planning and the current investors have no direct/immediate need for the funds.</p>\n<h2><strong>Our Property Business Recommendation</strong></h2>\n<p>Whilst each scenario is unique and needs to be considered in detail, the overall recommendation will depend upon the overall strategy on the property portfolio. Start with the end in mind and the structure will determine itself.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to hold one or two properties for short/medium-term, it could be beneficial to suffer the higher <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">rates of income tax</a> on the rental income, for the lower rates of capital gain upon disposal, which would suggest a sole trade or partnership could work best. Whereas if you want to build a larger portfolio of properties for the longer-term and reinvest any proceeds made, a limited company may be preferred. If you have specific requirements however, other structures, such as Pensions and Trusts could be considered.</p>\n<p>The answer may also be different if it is to be set up versus is an existing business, as changes in the structure of an existing business may attract SDLT if careful thought is not given. This cost needs to be considered in the cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tax Rates &amp; Allowances</strong></h3>\n<p>The rates and allowances discussed here all relate to 2019/20. If you want to see what these rates are for other years, please see our handy <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Ftax-rates-and-allowances\">Resources</a> section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Undeclared Property Income?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you receive rental income historically as an individual (sole trade or partnership) but didn’t declare it to HMRC, there is still the opportunity to do so under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/let-property-campaign-your-guide-to-making-a-disclosure/let-property-campaign-your-guide-to-making-a-disclosure\">Let Property Campaign</a>.

To help you, we’ve put together an overview of what you need to know about <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax</a> in the construction, demolition, installation, decoration, engineering and scaffolding industry.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>What</strong><strong> are the construction VAT changes?</strong></p>\n<p>HMRC is introducing the domestic reverse charge, effective from 1<sup>st</sup> October 2019. This will change the way VAT is charged for certain construction services and will require a change of approach from those supplying and receiving certain goods subject to VAT.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the change is to address the millions lost each year because of missing trader fraud. This is when <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">businesses in the construction industry</a> charge VAT to customers but this doesn’t get declared to HMRC.</p>\n<p><strong>How will the VAT domestic reverse charge work?</strong></p>\n<p>The new domestic reverse charge will apply to the supply of specified services charged at the standard and reduced rate of VAT. This will occur between VAT registered businesses where goods and services are for onward sale. While the supplier will issue an invoice that states the service is subject to the reverse charge, it will be the recipient who must account for the VAT in their VAT return. They will not pay the VAT to the supplier.</p>\n<p><strong>What services will be included in the domestic reverse charge?</strong></p>\n<p>The new VAT rules will apply to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">construction services, as defined in the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</a>, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Construction</li>\n<li>Demolition</li>\n<li>Repairs</li>\n<li>Alterations</li>\n<li>Installation of heating, lighting, water, air conditioning and drainage</li>\n<li>Painting and decorating</li>\n<li>Civil engineering works</li>\n<li>Scaffolding erectors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This scheme will not apply to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zero rated supplies</li>\n<li>Services supplied to an end user</li>\n<li>Certain supplies between connected companies</li>\n<li>Certain supplies between landlord and tenant</li>\n<li>Architects, surveyors and other consultants</li>\n<li>Recipients that are not VAT registered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your work is not covered by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">the changes, such as professional services of architects, the way VAT is invoiced</a> will not change, but going forward it’s advisable to keep reviewing the VAT requirements throughout the project because if the services supplied change, so may the VAT position.</p>\n<p><strong>What actions should you take?</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure you’re ready for domestic reverse charge you may need to make some changes, so it’s worth reviewing these key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure you fully understand the VAT changes</li>\n<li>Review your supply chain to identify the services included and suppliers who may be subject to the reverse charge</li>\n<li>Ensure your accounting software can adapt to the VAT requirements</li>\n<li>Review your invoicing process</li>\n<li>Consider how you will complete your VAT reporting from October</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think you need further information to make sure you don’t get caught out by the VAT changes or find out how our specialist tax team can help you, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

Is this you?

One of the anticipated areas is the IR35 rules, for those in the private sector from April 2020. Please don’t worry however, as we hear about any changes, we will be in touch with you directly on this and indeed any other areas of interest for you.</p>\n<h2><strong>VAT on Construction Businesses</strong></h2>\n<p>The way VAT is charged on construction services will change from October 2019. HMRC have introduced the Domestic Reverse Charge (DRC) as part of new anti-fraud rules. This will change the person responsible for accounting for VAT in relation to certain supplies of construction services. In particular, supplies between sub-contractors and main contractors will be impacted by the changes, with the main contractor responsible for declaring the VAT against an equivalent VAT deduction, subject to the normal VAT recovery rules.</p>\n<p>The rules will impact ‘Construction services’ as <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">defined by the Construction Industry Scheme (‘CIS’)</a>, i.e., construction, demolition, repairs and alterations, drainage, painting and decorating, scaffolding, the installation of heating, lighting, water and power etc.</p>\n<p>If you think you will be impacted by this and want to talk it through with us, please get in touch with us.</p>\n<h2><strong>Gross CIS Scheme</strong></h2>\n<p>One of our client’s biggest frustrations with HMRC is the deduction of CIS from invoices for client’s in Construction Services i.e., you are paid net. Did you know you could get paid gross here? To qualify you must apply to HMRC and show that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you’ve paid your tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> on time in the past;</li>\n<li>your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">business does construction work</a> (or provides labour for it) in the UK;</li>\n<li>your business is run through a bank account; and</li>\n<li>your business turnover (excluding VAT) over the last twelve months must be at least:\n<ul>\n<li>£30,000 if you’re a sole trader;</li>\n<li>£30,000 for each partner in a partnership, or at least £100,000 for the whole partnership; or</li>\n<li>£30,000 for each director of a company, or at least £100,000 for the whole company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are interested in finding out more, get in touch with us today.</p>\n<h3><strong>Team News</strong></h3>\n<p>Marisa Pilich is moving on to pastures new after five years with us, but I am delighted to say that Donna Sharp has joined us from Haines Watts Basingstoke.

      "content": "<p>While it may initially appear to be a good idea to purchase your new car (or other vehicle) through a limited company, I always advise my clients to take the time to understand the implications of purchasing a car this way.</p>\n<p>When you look into the details, a company owned car may not be as cost effective as you might think.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Considerations for buying a car through your company</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re considering whether to buy a car for work purposes either personally or through your business, there are several factors that will impact on the eventual cost to you. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How will the car be purchased;</li>\n<li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions;</li>\n<li>Whether the car is solely for business use;</li>\n<li>The list price cost of the car; and</li>\n<li>Will it be a pool car?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Costs to consider buying the car personally</strong></p>\n<p>When purchasing a car in your own name generally, you will be entitled to claim a tax-free allowance from your company for business miles, at 45p for the first 10,000 miles and 25p per mile thereafter.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">claim needs to comply with HMRC rules and be in line with the current reimbursement rate, but the company can then claim corporation tax relief</a> on the reimbursed amount. This allowance contributes towards fuel costs and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vehicles/\">vehicle wear and tear</a> but financing the purchase of the vehicle personally does not allow for tax deductions to be made on the initial costs and you cannot claim future tax relief on road tax, insurance, servicing etc.  There are some small costs you might be able to claim on, for example potentially car washes, but these are few and far between.</p>\n<p><strong>Costs to consider when buying the car through your company</strong></p>\n<p>How the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">tax allowance</a> on the cost of your car is treated depends on how you purchase a car through your business.</p>\n<p>If the car is financed through hire purchase or a loan, only the interest payment is allowed as a company expense. You also have the opportunity to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">claim Capital Allowances</a> for the cost, with the amount dependant on the CO2 emissions level. When leasing a car, the monthly payments can be claimed as a business expense in line with HMRC allowances, based again on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>\n<p><strong> Are company cars a</strong><strong>n expensive employee benefit?</strong></p>\n<p>Once the car is purchased, the cost of using a car provided by the business can really be felt in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">your personal tax payments</a>. As a benefit-in-kind, there will be a tax cost to the person using the car, which can be substantial, although it can be offset somewhat by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/fuel-costs-calculator/\">choosing a “greener” vehicle</a>.</p>\n<p>To the company there is the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> cost of providing this type of benefit. What started as a nice employee perk can then begin to feel like a substantial tax cost to both the employee and the employer.</p>\n<p>To understand the costs of this, for a specific vehicle, feel free to use our handy <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Fonline-calculators%2Fcompany-car-and-fuel-benefit-in-kind\">company car and fuel benefit calculator</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Considerations: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sole Traders and Partnerships </strong>&#8211; As there isn’t a separation of entities (i.e., you and your business are one and the same legally, unlike <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited Companies</a> and Limited Liability Partnerships), car costs can generally be allowed through the business, in proportion to what is business-related and what is personal;</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Liability Partnerships (‘LLPs’) – </strong>interestingly here, Members, as opposed to Employees or Directors, do not suffer <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">benefits-in-kind</a>. Therefore, provided the car or other vehicle is purchased for business reasons, this can be a tax-efficient way to buy a vehicle through a business. However, this is an area HMRC have shown particular interest in recently, so you need to be sure that it really is purchased for business reasons;</li>\n<li><strong><em>VAT </em></strong>– this is a can of worms in itself, but if you have a VAT-registered business, essentially for VAT to be reclaimable, the vehicle must be commercial (i.e., not a car) and a pool vehicle available to all employees with incidental (at most) personal use, i.e., it cannot be used for commuting or use by your family; and</li>\n<li><strong><em>Capital Allowances </em></strong>– like VAT rules, capital allowances are much less generous for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-talk-the-double-cab-pickup-car-or-commercial-vehicle/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"9\">cars then commercial vehicles</a>, so you might want to factor this into your decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Talk to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> before making a decision on company car purchase</strong></p>\n<p>To fully establish the potential cost to you of each purchase option you need to consider a wide range of factors that will impact cost in the context of your individual situation.</p>\n<p>If you would like further information about how to purchase a company car, our specialist business advice team can help you and we can pull together a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">bespoke calculation</a>, based on your business’ specific circumstances. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>In the modern world Banks have a perplexing problem; consumers want more convenience (easy ways to check their balance and make payments) at the same time as greater safety and security (of their data and finance, especially post General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’)). A few changes have taken place recently as steps towards this, known as Open Banking.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Open Banking rules are designed so banks must share your financial information with other authorised providers. For those of you that for example use Bank Feeds into Xero or QuickBooks, this isn’t new, but the legislation paves the way for an acceleration of the sharing of your financial data, safely and securely, across more platforms. Yes, it is delayed, and yes, it is less extensive than hoped, but we’re still excited about it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Payment Service Directive (‘PSD2’) and Target Instant Payments Settlement (‘TIPS’)</strong></h2>\n<p>At the start of 2018 the PSD2, took effect across the EU seeking to both encourage collaborative efforts between banks, FinTech’s, and third parties to have greater access to financial information via application programming interface (‘APIs’). Their aim was clear; maintain Europe’s competitiveness in the face of technological competition globally. Linked to it is the TIPS, which aims to be become a widely used pan-European fast bank-to-bank payment network.</p>\n<p>The first key deadline of 14 March 2019 came and went with just 59% of the 442 European banks completing their work in time (UK only: 67%). The next deadline is 14 September 2019, when banks are expected to have implemented dedicated APIs for third parties; it’s safe to say there won’t be 100% compliance here. That said, their challenges aren’t insignificant; this isn’t an easy space and Facebook quickly pulled the plug on its Messenger person-to-person (P2P) payments service.</p>\n<p>Open Banking should open the way to new products and services that could help customers and Small and Medium Sized Entities (‘SMEs’) to get a better deal. It could also give you a more detailed understanding of your accounts, and help you find new ways to make the most of your money. Where the providers are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), the world of Apps and Websites can accelerate this further.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry however, you are still in control; you decide who has access to what and for how long.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do these Open Banking changes mean for me?</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-apps-bookkeeping-software-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Bookkeeping software</a> can enable you to email quotes and invoices directly to your customers. You can then use bank feeds to take the legwork out of bookkeeping, with expenses captured and payment of invoices noted. All of this can be done anywhere in the world where you have an internet connection.</p>\n<p>Where you use bookkeeping software, such as Xero or QuickBooks this should be a big step forward, as more banks will be able to provide your financial information to these platforms, directly and freely. You will no longer have to do CSV uploads or use third parties who use screen-scraping technology, like Yodlee, so the data is more up to date, more quickly and more secure. However, before you turn off the old one, we would recommend that you test the new feed so there aren’t any gaps in data. In the short-term, where your bank is not compliant, there may be a few hiccups with disruption to your current feed and you may have to for example do manual CSV uploads into these platforms.</p>\n<h2><strong>Does Open Banking mean an Evolution or Revolution?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are some key new entrants into the banking marketplace, with Monzo, Tide and Starling just three who are entering Business Banking. Compared with the Traditional Banks, they are much better placed to not only meet the new legislation quickly, as they are much more agile and have more lean architecture that can be designed from the bottom-up, but they can also benefit significantly as their data can be shared across many platforms, reducing the impact of close relationships, such as NatWest has with FreeAgent. With these new incumbents changing the face of banking, will they be the catalysts for much needed change, and will they introduce competition in the marketplace with more customer choice? Or will they simply serve a purpose then be acquired by the Traditional Banks or die a death? Only time will tell. They may however at least contribute to bringing the Open Banking dream more to life, by putting more pressure on the Traditional Banks.</p>\n<h2><strong>Open Banking’s Impact on Price Comparison Sites</strong></h2>\n<p>Price Comparison websites transformed the Insurance Sector and there is still hope the Open Banking regulations will have a similar impact on the banking world. It’s not there yet, but with consumer pressure, there is still hope and the revolution is certainly underway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Get ready for Open Banking</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are unclear how the Open Banking Regulations will impact you, or you are having issues with your bookkeeping software as a result of the change and don’t know what to you, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>In line with other similar changes in the tax system, HMRC have decided to delay the implementation of the VAT changes for the Construction industry by 12 months, after much pressure from the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) and other business groups.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The Reverse Charges on VAT were due to come into effect from 1<sup>st</sup> October 2019. However, it has now been delayed until at least 1<sup>st</sup> October 2020.</p>\n<p>This is good news for most in this sector, as it gives them more time to understand the changes and prepare for them, especially with other uncertainties in the marketplace, currently not helping the market conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>What were the proposed changes in the way construction VAT would change?</strong></p>\n<p>HMRC was introducing the domestic reverse charge, effective from 1<sup>st</sup> October 2019. This would have changed the way VAT was charged for certain construction services and would have required a change of approach by those supplying and receiving certain goods subject to VAT. Those on flat-rate schemes would most likely find it best to transition to full rate scheme as part of this change.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the change was to address the millions lost each year because of missing trader fraud. This is when <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">businesses in the construction industry</a> charge VAT to customers, but this doesn’t get declared to HMRC. It would also have meant that HMRC would have had less businesses to potentially investigate and manage.</p>\n<p><strong>How would the VAT domestic reverse charge have worked?</strong></p>\n<p>The new domestic reverse charge would have applied to the supply of specified services charged at the standard and reduced rate of VAT. This would have occurred between VAT registered businesses where goods and services are for onward sale. While the supplier would issue an invoice that states the service is subject to the reverse charge, it would have been the recipient who had to account for the VAT in their VAT return. They would then not pay the VAT to the supplier.</p>\n<p><strong>What services were included in the domestic reverse charge?</strong></p>\n<p>The new VAT rules would have applied to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">construction services, as defined in the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</a>, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Construction;</li>\n<li>Demolition;</li>\n<li>Repairs;</li>\n<li>Alterations;</li>\n<li>Installation of heating, lighting, water, air conditioning and drainage;</li>\n<li>Painting and decorating;</li>\n<li>Civil engineering works; and</li>\n<li>Scaffolding erectors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This scheme would not have applied to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zero rated supplies;</li>\n<li>Services supplied to an end user;</li>\n<li>Certain supplies between connected companies;</li>\n<li>Certain supplies between landlord and tenant;</li>\n<li>Architects, surveyors and other consultants; or</li>\n<li>Recipients that are not VAT registered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your work is not covered by the changes, such as professional services of architects, the way VAT was invoiced, was not proposed to change.</p>\n<p><strong>What actions should you take?</strong></p>\n<p>In all honesty, whilst in an ideal world you would get your head around the above, we would not recommend any direct action right now, especially as there is potential for further changes or delay. However, between three to six months before the planned changes, we would recommend that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure you fully understand the VAT changes;</li>\n<li>Review your supply chain to identify the services included and suppliers who may be subject to the reverse charge;</li>\n<li>Ensure your accounting software can adapt to the VAT requirements;</li>\n<li>Review your invoicing process; and</li>\n<li>Consider how you will complete your VAT reporting from October 2020, assuming no further changes in the timeline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think you need further information to make sure you don’t get caught out by the VAT changes, to keep up to date, or to find out how our specialist tax team can help you, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

At times the pressure can become overwhelming, stress levels rise and this impacts on how effectively they can run their business.</p>\n<p>This was the case for one business owner who came to us; he ran several businesses, had fallen three years behind in his accounts and tax affairs and his business faced closure, with a loss of his income and assets. Unfortunately, the pressures of what was happening had impacted his mental health.</p>\n<p>It had got to the state when our client was getting stressed just by receiving mail, he was in denial of the situation and things were building up. He had developed a “brown envelope” phobia of receiving more demands and bills.</p>\n<p>This already difficult situation was made worse because he was involved in a tax scheme that was now being reviewed by HMRC and there was every chance he could be facing a substantial retrospective tax bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Time to take action</strong></p>\n<p>Our experience of dealing with such matters meant that we could roll up our sleeves and pitch in to help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within two weeks we had dealt with all the outstanding accounts and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> and got the businesses up to date;</li>\n<li>We had all his brown envelope mail redirected to us so we could deal with it immediately, lifting a big burden from our client; and</li>\n<li>We negotiated with the relevant agencies (banks, HMRC, lenders etc) on his behalf so everyone was aware of the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We continue to support the client with his dealings with HMRC regarding tax and he is now up to date and feels able to move forward with the business. He has also been relieved of much of the stress that had built up over the years.</p>\n<p>Now, both he and his new consultancy business are doing well, because he is able to focus on what he does best, his business.</p>\n<p><strong>We do more than just manage accounts</strong></p>\n<p>When we are approached by clients in the same situation, we are very aware that our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/\">service needs to go beyond accounts</a> expertise.

      "content": "<p>Making Tax Digital (‘MTD’) is an HMRC initiative attempting to transform the UK tax system, with more regular and detailed submissions of information and payments of tax to HMRC electronically.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Whilst it has been delayed several times, it aims to make tax administration more effective, efficient, and easier for taxpayers through the implementation of a fully digitalised tax system by 2020, whilst also reducing HMRC’s overheads for managing tax affairs.</p>\n<p>The first wave is underway, with VAT registered businesses, with a turnover over £85,000 (‘the threshold’) undergoing the change. Put simply, these businesses need to be submitting their VAT returns either through compliant software, such as Xero, Quick Books, Sage or a bridging software. If the business is VAT registered but turnover is beneath the limit, they can opt-out.</p>\n<p>However, whilst this is a change most businesses can implement, even HMRC have acknowledged this isn’t as achievable for all businesses, which is explained more below.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who might be Exempt from MTD?</strong></h2>\n<p>The three categories that HMRC have identified are businesses, which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subject to an insolvency procedure;</li>\n<li>Run entirely by practising members of a religious society or order whose beliefs are incompatible with using electronic communications or keeping electronic records; and/or</li>\n<li>It is not reasonably practicable to use digital tools to keep business records or submit the VAT returns because of age, disability, remoteness of location or for any other reason.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first two are relatively straightforward and self-explanatory. The third category is the one which is most likely to be more difficult to agree with HMRC, so further correspondence and appeals may well be required. However, here are our thoughts at this stage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is unlikely to be possible to claim exemption purely on account of age; HMRC has not set any specific age which would automatically rule someone out of MTD. Instead, it will consider how ‘your age and circumstances impact your ability to follow the rules for MTD’;</li>\n<li>Lack of familiarity with relevant software also won’t be enough to claim exemption. HMRC will take into account how much someone uses computers, smartphones and the internet for other purposes – and hence whether it is reasonable for them to learn how to use MTD software, or not.</li>\n<li>More generally an exemption is unlikely to be available solely on the basis that reasonable effort, time and cost may be involved in moving to MTD – but HMRC will take effort, time and cost into account in its overall assessment of whether it is practical for someone to follow the rules for MTD. Deciding what is reasonable in this context could be difficult and will vary from business to business according to circumstances.</li>\n<li>The guidance also discusses support from friends or family members, which might enable someone who would otherwise qualify for exemption, to meet the MTD requirements – but could be withdrawn. If the support stops and MTD compliance is impossible without it, an exemption application will need to be made.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to apply for exemption</strong></h2>\n<p>The VAT general enquires team will accept applications by telephone or in writing. Make sure you have the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>VAT Registration Number;</li>\n<li>business name and principal place of business;</li>\n<li>the reason for the exemption request;</li>\n<li>details about how VAT Returns are currently filed;</li>\n<li>the reasons why it would not be possible to file returns through software or keep digital records (even if it is possible to file using VAT online services); and</li>\n<li>any other reason why the rules for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/making-tax-digital-next-steps-delayed/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"45\">Making Tax Digital</a> cannot be followed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HMRC will be issuing decisions in writing and aim to do so within ten days, subject to the number of applications and the volume of their other work. Appeals can be made if you are initially unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Remember to continue to file VAT returns in the meantime whilst awaiting a response from HMRC, or if appealing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Who Doesn’t need to apply for the Exemption?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are already exempt from <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">filing VAT Returns online</a>, or beneath the threshold and have opted-out, you do not need to apply for the exemption.</p>\n<p><strong>HMRC’s Light Touch</strong></p>\n<p>HMRC have already said they will not be raising interest and penalties in a lot of instances of non-compliance in the first twelve months of MTD. That said we still recommend doing everything you can to be compliant with the new regulations, if you are unable to achieve an exemption. If in doubt, and need some help please just <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact us</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How we can help with MTD</strong></p>\n<p>We can of course help you with any of the above, whether it’s ensuring you are compliant, or making an application for you to be exempt from MTD.</p>\n<p>We offer <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-software-implementation-training-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">software implementation and training</a> on any of the above mentioned bookkeeping software and many others besides.

There is a limit as to how much the higher earning spouse can earn and they must not be a higher rate taxpayer to benefit from this additional tax allowance.</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re selling something that would be subject to capital gains tax, you can transfer these items pre-sale between married or civil partners so you are able to use both your annual allowances to make a profit free of tax before you’re required to pay capital gains tax.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/inheritance-tax/\"><strong>Inheritance tax</strong></a></p>\n<p>As a surviving spouse or civil partner, you may receive the estate of a deceased partner with no immediate taxes to be paid and if the deceased partner had unused Inheritance Tax Nil Rate, this can also be passed to the surviving partner. There’s also potential for another allowance, referred to as the Residence Nil Rate Band, which provides for a further tax exemption if the property was the residence at the time of death.</p>\n<p><strong>ISAs</strong></p>\n<p>ISAs are exempt from inheritance tax, but the ISA allowance can also be passed on and will be in addition to the surviving partners ISA allowance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\"><strong>Limited Companies</strong></a></p>\n<p>One common strategy is to have both you and your partner as shareholders and directors, so you have double the amount of dividend and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax bands</a> to use up, depending on any other sources of income you both may have. There is also some pension planning which you can both potentially enjoy, to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-planning-and-structuring-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">reduce your corporation tax</a> and increase your financial planning. That said, it does not necessitate you being in a civil partnership or marriage for this to be the case; it is just safer if you do as you are likely to pay them their share if you split up anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Tax allowances for children</strong></p>\n<p>The above tax relief schemes are dependent on you being married or in a civil partnership but if you have children, there are additional tax benefits, which don’t rely on you being married or in a civil partnership.</p>\n<p>Although the government has consolidated many benefits under the Universal Credits scheme it’s still possible to get tax credit for children under this scheme, which will be assessed based on your circumstances and income.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you wish to establish savings for your children, there are tax efficient options to explore to get the most from your investments. Junior ISAs, regular gifts from income and inheritances can attract tax depending on who the gift is from, but they are still worth exploring.</p>\n<p><strong>Divorce</strong></p>\n<p>According to the ONS, 42% of marriages in England and Wales end in Divorce, with January 7 named ‘Divorce Day’, the day when a break-up is most likely to take place. As you would expect, based on the above, there are some downsides to getting divorced. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will lose your spousal transfer for both <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax;</a></li>\n<li>Divorce does not revoke a will, so make sure you update your accordingly and get the right advice – we can help you here; and</li>\n<li>Whilst there is no <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-ated-and-stamp-duty-land-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Stamp Duty Land Tax</a> if couples split, if you move out of the family home (which is likely to be your largest asset), the final 18 months of ownership will still benefit from the capital gain exemption. However this is reduced to nine months for disposals made one or after 6 April 2020. To make matters worse, after April 2020, any capital gains tax will be payable within 20 days of transfer of a property, rather than in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> following the gain arising.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expert tax advice in simple </strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White</a></p>\n<p>As with many tax matters, it’s not always straightforward to understand what you may be eligible for and how to make the most of your allowances.

It&#8217;s no wonder that everything you spend your money on becomes a complicated decision &#8211; after all, pour too much in and you end up folding fast, but don&#8217;t pour enough in and you might be stagnating your own growth and potential.</p>\n<p>Paying for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">services</a> is particularly hard, especially if there&#8217;s half a chance you could do the work yourself.

Can&#8217;t you design your own logo?</p>\n<p>And there, right front and centre, is the accountant. Can&#8217;t you just fill in your own accounts and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> and save the money?</p>\n<p>The question is simple: is it worth investing in an accountant for a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-start-ups/\">small one-person start up</a>?</p>\n<p>The answer is: yes!</p>\n<h2>Reason #1 &#8211; Saving money</h2>\n<p>In a weird twist of logic, paying an accountant to do your tax is making money. It is our job to look at your tax and do everything we can to make sure you’re not paying too much. Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs are actually quite fair people, and don&#8217;t think you should be paying so much tax that you find it difficult to run your business.The key is to claim as much in expenses as you can, so you are not paying more tax than you need to. This is not tax avoidance or evasion, it is just using the allowances and expenses which are available to you. Not only is there tax legislation, there is also tax cases which occur every day and impact on what you can claim and how you can claim. This is knowledge and skill that your accountant has.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be honest, we&#8217;re probably not that good at your job. We&#8217;re poor <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-talk-pimlico-plumbers-employment-status-corporation-tax/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"8\">plumbers</a>, incompetent designers and awful IT consultants, but we&#8217;re great when it comes to understanding the finer nuances of accounting and tax regulations.</p>\n<p>For the small fee you pay your accountant, you are likely to save many time more in just paying the correct tax.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, you don&#8217;t even have to settle your account with us until we&#8217;ve saved you the money!</p>\n<h2>Reason #2 &#8211; One less thing to worry about</h2>\n<p>Most new entrepreneurs will list tax and finance as one of their top worries. There&#8217;s the feeling (no matter how illogical) that the tax man is sitting there ready to pounce. In conversations with our clients, we hear so much fear of HMRC, but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; we are here to lift that burden entirely.</p>\n<p>Working with an accountant means someone else is dealing with the stuff that you may not understand, making sure every box is correctly ticked and all relevant deadlines met.</p>\n<p>Tax man still, but bogeyman no longer!</p>\n<h2>Reason #3 &#8211; A feeling of legitimacy</h2>\n<p>Feeling like you are playing at running a business can overtake even the most confident company director. Like the Wizard of Oz, once you see behind the curtain it&#8217;s easy to feel that you&#8217;re just making it up as you go along, and that you&#8217;re not really doing it properly. It&#8217;s amazing how working with an accountant can remove that uncertainty and turn it into a real feeling of legitimacy.</p>\n<p>Our clients often tell us that this reason alone really puts them on track to make their business a success.</p>\n<h2>Reason #4 &#8211; See your business grow</h2>\n<p>When your accounts are properly organised, you can really see how your business is doing in the key area that means the most &#8211; financially.</p>\n<p>Remember asking yourself if you&#8217;d be able to afford to eat, and if you could afford to invest? With detailed accounts that are easy to read you can see exactly how the business is doing and what you should focus on in the coming months and years.</p>\n<p>The beauty of accounting software can help bring your business to life, so any time, anywhere in the world you can see just how it is performing. This will save you time, help you make better decisions and who know, maybe you will enjoy it all more too!</p>\n<h2>Reason #5 &#8211; Make a new friend</h2>\n<p>We might only see you once or twice a year, or we might meet up regularly to go through figures, but we like to think that we&#8217;re a friendly face. Come to our office for a coffee and a chat or let us come to you to discuss your needs in your environment &#8211; we&#8217;ll get you sorted in no time.</p>\n<h2>Reason #6 – it’s not just us it’s who we know too</h2>\n<p>We also work closely with strategic partners such as Financial Advisers, HR Consultants, Marketing &amp; PR specialists, Mortgage Brokers, Solicitors and Virtual PAs, to name but a few, to ensure we have great people working in the wings to support you, if and when you need it. There will even be people ready to assist you that, right now, you don’t know you need, but they’re there, waiting to help you.</p>\n<h3>Contact Us today</h3>\n<p>We want to develop a long-term relationship with you, we want to be there with you along your business journey, from inception, through growth to maturity.</p>\n<p>We offer a free initial consultation when we get the opportunity to better understand you, your business and how we can best work with you to help you achieve your dreams.

      "content": "<p>Self assessment tax returns! Do those words bring on a headache? As we approach the winter months and the end of the year our thoughts may be turning to more exciting things than tax returns (psst! there only 11 weekends until Christmas!). However, now is a very good time to start thinking about filing your 2018-2019 tax return (if you haven’t already); instead of spending your Christmas hols completing it.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Do You Need An Accountant To Complete Your Tax Return?</h2>\n<p>There is no mandatory requirement for the self-employed or small companies, to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">use an accountant</a>. So <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">for sole traders</a> and small businesses with straightforward accounts, or a low income that necessitates making savings, completing your own tax return is entirely feasible. With the advent of cloud accounting systems such as <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-software-implementation-training-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Xero</a>, the process is even easier with all your accounting information held in one place. But there are good reasons why <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-find-an-accountant-for-your-business/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"42\">an</a> accountant can be an asset to your business, and why you should delegate the job of filing your tax return to an expert.</p>\n<h2>Benefits Of An Accountant</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the major benefit is that you can pass that headache over to someone else! This also means that you can invest your time in more profitable ways, doing what you do best for your business. If you are only required to complete the short version of the self assessment tax return, then your accounts may be simple enough for you to justify spending the time on this yourself. However, if it’s likely to take you some time, consider what you could be doing instead…</p>\n<p>The other key advantage over <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">completing tax returns</a> yourself is that an accountant should be able to spot <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">ways you can save money</a>. In fact, even after paying the accountant’s fee you could make significant savings, especially if you have missed expenses that could be claimed for in the past.</p>\n<p>Error is also a factor when you file your own tax return, and you can’t be expected to keep up-to-date with tax law and its implications, especially if your business is unrelated to finance and accounting. Naturally, a trusted accountant will know exactly where you stand in relation to tax rules and regulations, and will give you the peace of mind that your tax return has been completed correctly.</p>\n<h2>Finding An Accountant that suits you</h2>\n<p>If you decide that you would like to get an expert to do your tax return, then now is the time to find an accountant. Don’t leave it until the last minute! Although many accountants offer a one off <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">service for self assessment tax returns</a>, their priority will always be with their existing clients, and therefore may not be able to fit you in if you leave it until the New Year.</p>\n<p>There are budget options online but many of these amount to little more than data input services, by the time you’ve provided the information you may as well have filed it directly to HMRC. It’s worth shopping around to find a service that also offers advice on expenses, business use of a home, pension contributions etc. so that you can potentially reduce your taxes.</p>\n<p>Of course accountants do not just complete tax returns, they perform a multitude of other duties too, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">Book keeping.</a></li>\n<li>Setting up and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">running company payroll</a>.</li>\n<li>Registering the company with relevant tax departments –VAT,Corporation Tax, PAYE, etc.</li>\n<li>Dealing with company and accounting related correspondence – Companies House, HMRC etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-planning-and-structuring-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Tax planning advice</a>.</li>\n<li>Budgets, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">cash flows &amp; business plan</a> reports.</li>\n<li>Dividend administration</li>\n<li>Business mentoring.</li>\n<li>Providing professional references.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find an ACCA certified accountant in your area by searching here.</p>\n<p>So if you are a growing business it may be time to talk to an accountant about your long term plans, not just your year-end tax return. For holistic guidance tailored to your growing business, engaging with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">professional self-assessment accountant</a> can provide insights beyond year-end tax returns. At Black and White Accounting we look after clients with varying accountancy needs; from self-employed sole traders or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">freelancers</a>, to limited companies including micro businesses and SMEs.

The rules here are not that simple, but with the right advice, they don’t need to make the process any harder, for employers or employees.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>What is a Settlement agreement?</h2>\n<p>A settlement agreement is a legally binding agreement between employer and employee and can be used in several different situations. Its purpose is to allow both parties to end an employment relationship, with the employee waiving their rights to bring a claim against the employer, in the process.</p>\n<p>As compensation, the employer will usually have agreed a sum of money that the employee will receive, potentially above and beyond the statutory minimum.</p>\n<h2><strong>Which payments are taxable, and which are tax-free?</strong></h2>\n<p>The settlement agreement will need to detail specific payments to be paid to the employee, including any ex-gratia/compensation amounts. The types of payments below illustrate the variations of taxable and non-taxable payments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ex gratia payments: First £30,000 of an ex gratia/compensation payment is tax-free. Anything in excess of £30,000, will be subject to tax and NI;</li>\n<li>Salary, benefits and bonuses: As contractual payments they are subject to tax and NI in the normal way;</li>\n<li>Holidays: Accrued holiday is subject to the normal tax and NI;</li>\n<li>Payment in lieu of notice (‘PILON’): This will need to be taxed as normal salary, whether or not there’s a PILON clause in the contract of employment;</li>\n<li>Pension: When made directly into the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions/\">pension scheme</a> the payment doesn’t need to be taxed;</li>\n<li>Redundancy: Contractual and statutory redundancy payments are considered as part of the £30,000 payment and also exempt from tax up to that amount;</li>\n<li>Restrictive covenants payments: These tend to be nominal amounts but still liable for tax and NI deductions;</li>\n<li>Injury to feeling payments: When arising from unlawful discrimination that happened before the termination, it won’t be taxed; if caused by the termination it will be; and</li>\n<li>Legal fees: If incurred by the employee pursuant to a specific term in the settlement agreement and for the termination of the employee, these fees would not be taxable, although payment is usually made directly from the employer to a legal representative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because these can be quite complex, we would recommend you either check the tax treatment yourself or speak to a professional. They are often miscalculated, even by big corporations and you want to make sure you are not paying more tax than you need to.</p>\n<h2><strong>What next &#8211; making the most of redundancy</strong></h2>\n<p>It might not feel like it at the time, but everything happens for a reason and if you have lost your job, it’s a great opportunity to re-assess what you are doing and what you want to do in the future. Have you considered starting your own business? Do you have a business idea which you want to make a reality? <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">If so, we’d love to hear more about it.</a></p>\n<h2><strong>P11Ds</strong></h2>\n<p>As a quick watch-out for employees, if you receive any <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">benefits-in-kind</a>, such as company car, private health care or insurance from your employer, and receive and pay this after the year end (as opposed to it being payroll’d), please be aware that you might receive a request from HMRC to pay this after you leave your position. If you have not been able to find a new opportunity, this can be particularly painful. If you really cannot afford to pay this, we recommend speaking to HMRC as soon as possible and trying to arrange a payment plan. Communication is key and the earlier you flag this, the better.</p>\n<h2><strong>Black and White Accounting: expert tax advice</strong></h2>\n<p>Tax arrangements under a settlement agreement can be complicated. To ensure you aren’t subject to HMRC penalties and interest for not making the correct tax and NI payments, seeking expert advice on taxable amounts will give you peace of mind.</p>\n<p>On a different note, if you are an employee who has lost their position, but have a business idea, which you want to talk through with someone, we’d love to hear more and help you make it a reality.</p>\n<p>If you would like more detailed information about taxable payments under a settlement agreement that’s tailored to your specific circumstances, want to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">check any calculations</a> of the consequences of these that you have been provided with, or have a great business idea, then our specialist team at Black and White can help you. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>VAT, or Value-Added Tax, is a consumption tax, where the tax is applied to the purchases of goods and services of taxable supplies. It is seen as a regressive tax because it impacts the poorer more than the rich, due to the higher propensity to spend of the former group. Initially modelled on the EU-framework, it is now deeply imbedded in the UK, generating significant revenues for HMRC, so it’s unlikely we will see the back of it any time soon.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>There are several ways you may become VAT registered. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legislation &#8211; You are above the VAT threshold;</li>\n<li>Customer &#8211; requires it, otherwise they will not engage with you;</li>\n<li>Reputational &#8211; You want to appear bigger that you actually are; and/or</li>\n<li>Financial – You have a lot of VAT expenses, which you want to reclaim e.g., you are refurbishing an office.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may not need to be VAT registered upon starting up, but you do need to keep an eye on your turnover and you can’t just leave it to your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/\">Accountant</a> to resolve this at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>The current registration limit is £85,000 (2019/20 tax year). What this means is if you expect to exceed this on a 12-month rolling basis in the next 30 days, or your turnover is more than this over the last 12-months, you need to notify HMRC, register for VAT and start charging your customers. If you don’t register in time, HMRC will ask you to pay the VAT on your gross sales, which you should have collected on behalf of your customers and may charge interest and penalties too, so it can quickly get painful!</p>\n<h2><strong>How does VAT registration work</strong></h2>\n<p>If, for example, you charge £100 per hour for your services, once you are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/do-i-need-to-be-vat-registered/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"125\">VAT registered</a> you essentially need to charge £100 + VAT per hour, or £120. However, don’t forget, the additional £20 is not yours. You are essentially acting as agents, collecting tax on behalf of HMRC. It is good practice here to transfer this amount into a separate bank account, so you have the money to pay HMRC as it falls due.</p>\n<p>On a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, you then <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vat-calculator/\">calculate the VAT</a> you collected on sales and reduce this by the VAT you paid on expenses, to work out how much you owe HMRC, or indeed how much they owe you.</p>\n<p>You also need to ensure you include your VAT number on your invoices, website and other business stationery.</p>\n<h2><strong>Consequences of VAT for your business</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the big implications to consider is how this will impact your business. Generally, if your customers are all businesses (Business-To-Business, or B2B), they are more likely to be VAT-registered themselves, so it will have minimal impact on your sales, as they can reclaim any VAT charged in their next VAT return.</p>\n<p>However, if they are individuals (Business-To-Consumer, or B2C), they are less likely to be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">VAT registered</a> themselves, so if you added VAT to your invoices, they would essentially experience a 20% (2019/20 tax year) increase in your prices. This might mean that you become less competitive, which could impact your business.</p>\n<p>Some businesses even choose to shrink, or intentionally stay below the VAT threshold so they don’t experience this issue. However, you may be surprised here. As noted above, an advantage of being VAT registered is your business may appear bigger than it actually is. You might then win work with bigger customers than you have in the past.</p>\n<h2><strong>MTD (Making Tax Digital)</strong></h2>\n<p>From April 2019 onwards, VAT registered businesses need to use compliant software, or bridging software from Excel to be able to submit their VAT returns to HMRC. Please see our earlier <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/prepare-for-making-tax-digital/\"><u>Blog</u></a> for more information about this.</p>\n<p>Whilst they are not without cost, they can also be of great benefit to your business. Having more regular financial information available can improve your decision-making, bank feeds can automate a lot of the admin time and invoicing through it not only looks more professional but managing debtors is easier to, to name but a few. We can help you here with what software to choose, implementation, training and on-going support, so don’t worry, you’re not alone.</p>\n<h2><strong>Still not sure if you should register for VAT?</strong></h2>\n<p>Simple; <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\"><u>contact us</u></a> today. There are lots of different types of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/which-vat-scheme-is-for-me-a-guide-for-uk-businesses/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"65\">VAT schemes</a>, such as monthly, quarterly or annual, cash or accruals, flat rate versus full scheme so we recommend you talk this through with a Professional today. Don’t leave it too late however and find out the hard way through interest and penalty payments.</p>\n<p>We offer a free initial consultation for new clients, to enable us to talk more with you, your business and what you are trying to achieve, to enable us to help you, as your Business Partner, to realise your dreams. VAT is often one of the key discussion points as part of this.</p>\n<p>We believe the customer comes first, we will work with you, however you want to work and that often evolves over time. For example, to begin with you may want to do your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">bookkeeping</a> yourself, with us just available on demand if and when you have problems.

For this individual, it led to anxiety over the accounts, VAT returns, tax returns and other obligations, which wasn’t helped by an accountant who was too expensive for them. They were afraid to even call their accountant as they knew they would get a bill, even for a call of a few minutes.</p>\n<p>As a result, they didn’t ask for help, their problems got worse and they fell further and further behind.</p>\n<h2><strong>Catching up on four years of accounts in two weeks</strong></h2>\n<p>However, when they finally came to us with their concerns, we were able to provide three things they really needed: advice, support and action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within two weeks we had sorted through their records and brought their accounts and tax affairs up to date;</li>\n<li>As a result, we secured a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">VAT refund</a> for them of over £10,000, which funded the closure of their limited company and gave them something extra to start afresh as a sole trader; and</li>\n<li>As the business was being closed, we negotiated with their bank so that they didn’t have to repay a large overdraft or their credit card debt as there were no personal guarantees here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After addressing all the existing issues our client was able to continue their business in the much simpler and easier format as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a>, which better suited them.</p>\n<p>Black and White Chartered Accountants work on a fixed fee basis, so there are no surprises.

We also proactively chase our clients, so as soon as a time period has ended, we will be in touch, with increasingly levels of keenness, as we get closer to any deadline.</p>\n<h2><strong>Knowing our clients</strong></h2>\n<p>Taking time to get to know the client and business enabled us to realise quickly that their enterprise structure wasn’t for them on a personal level or for the way they worked.</p>\n<p>For us, business is about more than doing your accounts and filing tax returns; seeking advice from the outset, from accountants with expertise in supporting businesses, can help an entrepreneur put their business on the right foundation, not just on tax considerations but for them personally. This can avoid subsequent problems and heartache when the burden of running a limited company becomes too much to bear.</p>\n<h2><strong>No matter how bad your situation, act now</strong></h2>\n<p>Most accountants offer a free initial consultation so, if you are thinking about setting up a business, take this opportunity to find one you feel you can work with for the long term.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are struggling to manage your business, don’t delay in acting.

The good news is that your business may be eligible to benefit from tax relief by participating in schemes encouraging businesses to go green.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>This will also be an interesting space in the upcoming election, with all of the key parties having policies in this area, so watch this space…</p>\n<h2><strong>Saving on tax by saving the planet</strong></h2>\n<p>The government has targeted some key areas to encourage businesses to protect the environment and, depending on the size and type of business you have, different <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">tax relief will be available to you</a>. Here are some key schemes that benefit many businesses:</p>\n<h2><strong>Low emission and electric vehicles </strong></h2>\n<p>Switching your company car to a low emission or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vehicles/\">electric vehicle can offer substantial tax savings:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can claim 100% of the first-year allowance for the full cost of purchasing a new low-emission car.</li>\n<li>The taxable benefit to an employee given a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/company-car-and-fuel-benefit-in-kind/\">company car</a> to use privately is lower for cars with lower carbon emissions.</li>\n<li>A low or zero emissions car entitles you to pay lower road tax.</li>\n<li>You may also be exempt from city centre congestion charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The government will continue to encourage businesses to make the switch to zero or low emission vehicles. From 2020, company car drivers who choose an emissions-free electric fleet model will pay no benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax for the year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Enhanced Capital Allowances</strong></h2>\n<p>This encourages businesses to invest in efficient technologies. To qualify for this tax relief, the energy efficient equipment, machinery or water-saving equipment must be new and included in the Energy Technology Criteria List. If the criteria are met, the scheme allows a business to claim 100% tax relief of the cost in the first year of purchase.</p>\n<h2><strong>Climate change agreement </strong></h2>\n<p>This scheme was implemented to encourage industrial, commercial and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/farming-agriculture-sector/\">agricultural businesses</a> and public service sectors to improve energy efficiency and use less energy to reduce the country’s CO2 emissions. Energy intensive businesses can volunteer to enter into a climate change agreement and benefit from a reduction in the Climate Change Levy rates, which can mean up to a 90% reduction for electricity and 65% for gas, LPG, coal and other solid fuels.</p>\n<h2><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong></h2>\n<p>OK so it is a bit of a stretch as it is not specific to green initiatives, but <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">R&amp;D tax credits</a> were established to drive innovation and recognise UK businesses that invest in research and development of new products, processes or services (or enhancing existing ones) allowing them to invest in further R&amp;D and growth. If you are developing green products and services, this could well be a great way to help you fund your innovation and either claim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an extra 130% of their qualifying costs from their yearly profit, as well as the normal 100% deduction, to make a total 230% deduction; or</li>\n<li>claim a tax credit if the company is loss making, worth up to 14.5% of the surrenderable loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This could be a key lever for helping us hit the ambitious greenhouse gas targets we have.</p>\n<h2><strong>Smaller-scale schemes</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to these schemes that consider larger scale changes there are also other, smaller schemes such as the Cycle to Work Scheme that encourage greener transport use with a tax benefit for the employee.</p>\n<h2><strong>Seeking advice</strong></h2>\n<p>With so many different schemes, and new Government directives being generated all the time, it’s always advisable to seek advice on which tax savings you may be eligible for whilst doing your bit to protect the plant.</p>\n<p>If you would like further information about tax relief on environmental initiatives, our specialist team of business tax advisors are ready to help you, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>When dealing with finances, there is a hierarchy that seems to exist in most people’s minds when it comes to making sure their family are cared for should anything unexpected happen to affect their ability to provide.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Many people take care to consider a will in the case of their death and combine it with life insurance and trusts to secure financial stability for those they leave behind.</p>\n<p>Some make provision for illness and an inability to work through insurance products like critical illness cover, or income protection, but many people overlook the service of a power of attorney &#8211; a simple level of preparation that can ensure that your financial assets are properly looked after in the event that you lose the mental capacity to do so yourself.</p>\n<h2>Preparing for frailty</h2>\n<p>No one likes to consider their own demise and making preparations for death or incapacity can feel uncomfortable, however, the relief that comes from having proper provisions in place is considerable. When plans are made to cater for undesired events in our lives, it is easier to relax and enjoy each day.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-wills-power-of-attorney-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Power of Attorney</a> document provides a cushion for you, giving you foreknowledge that your financial affairs and care needs will be properly and professionally taken care of if you find yourself unable to make the right decisions.</p>\n<h2>What is power of attorney?</h2>\n<p>A power of attorney gives authority for another person (or people) to act on your behalf if you are unable to make decisions yourself. There are two types of power of attorney (PoA); one to manage your financial affairs, and a second to cater for your health and welfare.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, we can work with you to create detailed power of attorney documentation and register it with the Office of the Public Guardian where it becomes official.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, we can work as your attorney for financial matters, providing you with a quality <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/financial-director-and-non-executive-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">independent professional service to alleviate you of any financial worry</a>.</p>\n<p>Generally, we would recommend that you consider a family member or close friend as your health and welfare attorney, though we can offer guidance and help in making this decision if you are unsure how you would like to proceed.</p>\n<p>In the different countries of the United Kingdom, power of attorney has varying names and some subtle differences, though in essence each serves the same purpose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>England and Wales: A property and financial affairs lasting power of attorney and a separate health and welfare lasting power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Scotland: A continuing power of attorney for financial matters, and a welfare power of attorney for health and care issues.</li>\n<li>Northern Ireland: An enduring power of attorney for financial matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in Northern Ireland, there is no welfare power of attorney and all PoAs are for financial matters only.</p>\n<h2>Why have a financial PoA?</h2>\n<p>Not only does your family rely on your financial stability but also (and often overlooked), so do you.</p>\n<p>If something were to happen in your life that compromises your ability to make sound financial decisions, then your life and security are at risk. It is possible for unscrupulous individuals or organisations to take advantage of your altered situation and convince you to sign away large amounts of wealth in a manner that is completely against your best interests.</p>\n<p>An example might be someone who has a substantial portfolio, including savings and company shares, being convinced by a family member to liquidate assets and pass the money onto them; perhaps to help them out of debt, or as an investment for their unstable business idea.</p>\n<p>While it is natural to trust family members, sadly there are too many examples where both close family and extended family attempt to manipulate in order to achieve a personal monetary gain.</p>\n<p>By using a neutral body, such as Black and White Accounting, as your power of attorney, you can be assured that future financial decisions on your behalf are truly done in your best interest and following guidelines that you set down.</p>\n<h2>Are power of attorney orders only for the wealthy?</h2>\n<p>The assumption that a power of attorney is only needed if you have a substantial financial asset to protect is an erroneous one. The question of your financial stability is the same for everyone; irrespective of personal wealth. A person who only owns a small flat may be considered less than rich, yet the damage that can be done to that individual if they lose their home through a misplacement of trust or simple administrative difficulties is as significant as it is for those with multi-million pound empires.</p>\n<p>Setting up a financial power of attorney with Black and White Accounting is simple and not costly, providing a level of security that is correctly scaled to your needs.</p>\n<h2>What situations lead to a PoA being used?</h2>\n<p>A power of attorney comes into force if you are in a position where your mental capacity to make decisions regarding your finances is compromised. This could happen due to an injury or accident; be part of the natural deterioration we all face as we age or be a symptom of an illness.</p>\n<p>A power of attorney should be set up while you are still at full mental capacity. That can be when there is nothing foreseen on the horizon which may cause a problem, or at a time when the early stages of a degenerative disease are discovered. It is possible for a power of attorney to be created after you have lost some mental faculty, but this is a far more difficult process that would need legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Preparing in advance is by far the best way to approach the situation, in a similar way to writing a will.</p>\n<h2>Why choose Black and White Accounting? Selecting your attorney</h2>\n<p>Many people believe that power of attorney is best given to a family member. When it comes to your health and a welfare PoA, we are in full agreement &#8211; it is important in those instances to select someone whom you trust and who is going to listen to your needs and undertake them, although there are reasons (discussed later in this article) to choose multiple attorneys in this case.</p>\n<p>A property and financial PoA, on the other hand, is best removed from anyone who may benefit from misappropriation of any funds. Though you may trust them implicitly, sometimes people’s own needs can outweigh their moral and loyal nature. It is for this reason that financial PoAs are kept separate from welfare ones.</p>\n<p>By using a respected third-party accountant, you can rest assured that any decision made regarding your money or assets will be made keeping your wishes a priority, with no question of mismanagement.</p>\n<p>It also prevents the very real problem of assigning power of attorney to someone of a similar age to yourself. Often people choose their spouses or partners as power of attorney without considering the simple fact that problems that come with age are as likely to affect your chosen attorney as yourself, leading to a sad situation that though a power of attorney is in place, it is effectively rendered useless.</p>\n<h2>What can an attorney do with PoA?</h2>\n<p>A power of attorney takes effect if you lose the mental ability to make sound financial decisions yourself. At this point, your attorney has full control over your assets and finances in the same way that you would do yourself. If you have chosen multiple attorneys, then they must agree on a course of action before implementing it.</p>\n<p>Those with power of attorney will not act without a proper understanding of the situation in full and will follow the wishes that have been outlined to them.</p>\n<p>For example, if you fall ill and require treatment that only the sale of your home would allow for, someone with financial power of attorney would not simply make that sale without full discussion with any family still living there and understanding of the full situation. However, ultimately the decision would be that of the attorney, following any additional guidelines you have made.</p>\n<p>It isn’t just large monetary decisions, however; your financial attorney will make sure that your day-to-day financial business is not impeded, including organising payments for bills and debts and properly redistributing regular outgoings to other family members as appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Health and welfare power of attorney</h3>\n<p>While working for you on behalf of your financial needs is one side of a power of attorney, a welfare attorney will ultimately be in charge of your care and choices made regarding where you live and what medical treatment you receive.</p>\n<p>It is important that your welfare attorney is someone whom you trust to fully understand any medical condition or other specialised needs that you may have. For this reason, you may want to consider a joint attorney position between a professional body such as Black and White Accounting, and a relative who understands and empathises with your personal care and preferences.</p>\n<h2>Changing attorneys or cancelling a lasting power of attorney</h2>\n<p>If you have an existing power of attorney you would prefer to move to us, or if you later want to cancel or change your power of attorney, this can be done directly by writing a deed of revocation and applying via the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney\">gov.uk website</a>.</p>\n<p>You can only cancel a lasting power of attorney while you still have full mental capacity.</p>\n<h2>Setting up power of attorney with Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>We offer a full power of attorney <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/\">service here at Black and White Accounting</a> and can help you through every stage of the process. If you would like to speak to us regarding this extra layer of protection for you and your family, then please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">contact us right away, fill in our contact form</a> or call us today!</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>One of the biggest headaches of an entrepreneur is building and retaining a great team, who understand your vision, and are able to consistently deliver what and how you want them to. Whilst there are lots of opportunities here, the focus of this article is shares. This is because they can be a way to bring the long-term objectives of employees and employers into line.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>There are several reasons why an employer would provide shares or the option to purchase shares to their employees. They can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aligning employee and business objectives;</li>\n<li>Attracting and retaining key employees;</li>\n<li>Incentivising employees to encourage enhanced performance, in potentially tax efficient ways;</li>\n<li>Raising equity funding, especially in Management/Employee buy-outs; and</li>\n<li>Succession planning for the business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the shares are given outright to the employee, the employee will have a taxable remuneration on the difference between the market value of the company’s shares, and the price (if any) paid. Share options can therefore be more tax efficient.</p>\n<p>There are four key ways of offering shares or the option of shares to employees, each of which are explored further below. The first three involve the use of share options; the final one involves the employer giving a fixed number of shares free of tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> (‘NI’).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Approved Share Option Scheme (‘CSOPs’)</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Company Share Options Schemes or CSOPs are approved share options schemes. They require HMRC approval and as such must fall within the HMRC guidelines. They are particularly suitable for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/family-investment-company/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"95\">family or owner-managed companies</a> because only selected employees need be included, where the employees work at least 25 hours a week, and do not have more than 25% share capital.</p>\n<p>They operate by granting the participants options to purchase shares in the company at a later date, but at a fixed price from the outset (usually the market value of the shares at the date the options are granted).</p>\n<p>The options can be exercised between three and ten years after being granted and can be made dependent on specific performance targets, but cannot exceed £30,000 in value (based on the share market value at date options were granted).</p>\n<p>In terms of tax implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee: there is no income tax (‘IT’) or NI when they are granted or when exercised (unlike unapproved schemes). On disposal there will be IT on the Capital Gain (‘CG’) at 10%/20% (i.e., disposal proceeds less the price paid when the options were exercised).</li>\n<li>Employer: Company will receive a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax deduction</a>, on exercise, of the difference between the market value of the shares less the price paid by the employer for the shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to our fees, the legal costs of setting up these schemes start from around £1,000+VAT, but can quickly get significantly more expensive, depending who they are offered to and how complex the terms are. They are therefore more common for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">larger limited companies</a>. We are happy to make referrals here to Strategic Partners we work with on a regular basis, if this would be helpful to you.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Unapproved share option schemes</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Similar to CSOPs, they grant the employee the option to acquire a number of shares at a future date, at a specified price by the company, but they do not require HMRC approval. As a result they are often more flexible, quicker and simpler to set up, only selected employees need to be offered them and there are no hours worked or share capital restrictions here.</p>\n<p>In terms of tax implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee: there is no IT or NIC when they are granted, if exercised within 10 years of when option is granted. Upon exercise, there will be an IT liability (difference between market value of shares at that date less price paid for them). There is no NIC however, as long as the shares are not readily convertible to cash (i.e., no arrangements by which the shares’ value can be realised with certainty). On disposal the employees pays IT on the CG at 10%/20% (i.e., disposal proceeds less the price paid when the options were exercised).</li>\n<li>Employer: Company will receive a corporation tax deduction, on exercise, of the difference between the market value of the shares less the price paid by the employer for the shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The costs here are typically slightly lower than CSOPs.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Enterprise Management Incentives (‘EMI’)</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>EMIs are designed to help smaller companies (gross assets &lt; £30million) with potential for growth, to recruit and retain high calibre employees and rewarding those employees for taking the risk of investing their time and skills to help the small company succeed.</p>\n<p>They offer any number of employees the option to buy shares in the company at or less than the market value of the shares up to £250,000 each (or £3million overall) and they must be exercised within 10 years. Employees must work at least 25 hours a week (if less, for at least 75% of their working time), and not have more than 30% share capital.</p>\n<p>Only selected employees need be included, voting restrictions can be placed over the shares (to protect the current owners) and they can be granted subject to performance criteria.</p>\n<p>The company must notify HMRC within 92 days of the options being granted and the market value of the shares has to be agreed with the HMRC. Formal HMRC approval is not required, but it is possible to obtain advance clearance that the company (not the employees) will meet the requirements.</p>\n<p>In terms of tax implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee: there is no IT or NIC when they are granted. There is also no IT or NIC when exercised, unless the option was granted at less than market value, then there will be a tax charge on the difference (collected through PAYE). On disposal any CG may qualify for Entrepreneur’s Relief, reducing the rate of tax to 10%, regardless of the tax band.</li>\n<li>Employer: Company will receive a corporation tax deduction, on exercise, of the difference between the market value of the shares less the price paid by the employer for the shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to our fees, the legal costs for setting these up are typically £2,000-2,500+VAT. They are however typically more common for small and medium-sized businesses as they can be cost effective and provide flexibility.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Share Incentive Plans (SIPs)</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>SIPs are designed to be flexible so all employees can participate and benefit from meeting specific performance targets. The shares acquired are held in a UK resident trust to ensure the independent legal ownership of the shares.</p>\n<p>Each tax year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employees can get up to £3,600 of “Free” shares free of IT and NI, some or all of which can be related to performance targets.</li>\n<li>Employees can then buy up to £1,800 of “Partnership” shares each tax year out of their pre-tax and NIC salary.</li>\n<li>Employers can then give employee “Matching” shares up to £3,600 free of IT and NI.</li>\n<li>Up to £1,800 of dividends can also be reinvested in shares tax-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shares must leave the plan when the employees leave their job and the company can decide whether employees lose their free shares if they leave within 3 years of them being granted.</p>\n<p>The offer to participate in SIPs must be available to all employees regardless of their role and work pattern, although a minimum period of employment can be specified of up to 18 months.</p>\n<p>In terms of tax implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee: if they keep the shares in a plan for 5 years there is no IT, NIC or CG on sale. If the employee take their shares out of the plan after three years, they will pay IT and NIC on the initial value of the shares (any increase while in the plan will be free of IT and NI). Employees who keep their shares in the plan until they are sold will have no CG to pay on sale. If they take the shares out and sell them later then there will be a charge (at 10/20%) on any increase in the value of the shares after they were taken out of the plan.</li>\n<li>Employer: Company will receive a corporation tax deduction, on exercise, of the difference between the market value of the shares less the price paid by the employer for the shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to our fees, the legal costs of setting up these schemes start from around £2,000 plus VAT, as a Trust needs to be set up in addition to the setting up of the scheme, but again, they can quickly get significantly more expensive, depending who they are offered to and how complex the terms are. They are therefore more common for larger and limited companies.</p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>Granting shares or share options can be a great way to motivate, stretch and retain key staff without paying cash directly to the employee or HMRC, and whilst maintaining control over your business, as they are typically only for very small shareholdings.</p>\n<p>The scheme used however will depend on how flexible you want the scheme to be, when you want it to be available, the value/size of the business in question, the number of employees in question and how much the client is prepared to pay to set up the scheme. The most common scheme used by small and medium-sized businesses are EMIs, as they offer enough flexibility, whilst often being relatively cost effective to set up.</p>\n<h3><strong>Contact us today</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a lot of options here.

      "content": "<p>Let’s not beat around the bush &#8211; getting a mortgage if you are self-employed or run your own business is hard. There are a lot of obstacles in the way of buying a property and if you are in the position where your work and your income fluctuates, then it can feel impossible to break through. Happily, though, it doesn’t need to be as bad as it first seems and having an accountant can make it possible.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we are able to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mortgage-calculator/\">help you secure a mortgage</a> when self-employed.</p>\n<h2>Why getting a mortgage when self-employed is difficult</h2>\n<p>Mortgage lenders are very keen to make the right decisions with their money and part of that is performing a risk assessment on every applicant. If you are an employee with a regular salary and years of history regarding your income and outgoings, then the assessment is very simple; almost at a single glance the prospective lender can see whether or not you look reliable.</p>\n<p>When you are self-employed, or the director of your own limited company, that risk assessment becomes a lot more complicated. First of all, you might not have the history in your business to be able to show any level of stability, and secondly, you may be trying to obtain a mortgage based on the money that you know is going to be there to you grow your business, but the mortgage company is keen to look at how things stood a year, two years and even three years in the past! Anyone who has run their business for a while knows that even a single year can make a huge difference in terms of growth and income.</p>\n<p>It gets worse. Lenders are used to assessing your mortgage viability based on things they are comfortable with &#8211; a regular PAYE salary, for example. Ask them to take into account a minor salary from <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">your limited company</a> that’s coupled with dividends in your position as director and shareholder, or make an assessment taking the last six months into greater consideration than the previous 18, and you could be out of luck.</p>\n<h2>How your accountant helps</h2>\n<h3>Showing your credibility</h3>\n<p>Having an accountant adds a level of respectability to your business that lenders appreciate. When you have an accountant, lenders can be sure that there’s a second set of professional eyes looking over the paperwork, and that there’s someone with a good understanding of your business (and probably personal) finances who is there to advise.</p>\n<p>It’s not merely a feeling of confidence that an accountant brings, however, but the ability to clearly present the information in a way that the lender needs.</p>\n<h3>Presentation is everything</h3>\n<p>It’s not enough to simply say ‘I have this much money each month to pay the mortgage’; the lender needs to see that number themselves. Mortgage providers will look to bank statements as a good indicator of your finances, but when you run a business those statements can be complicated and not present the information in a way that makes immediate sense to the person making the final decision.</p>\n<p>An accountant will go through your finances, both business and personal, and draw up the information in a way that clearly shows your level of affordability. This is key, as clearly showing your income, your outgoings, and your business stability all help the lender assess the risk you present. With this data, they can make a decision that is right for them, but also the best for you. Ever since the crash of 2008, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-services/the-best-mortgage-and-lending-support-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">mortgage lenders</a> are extra careful to be responsible and only lend when absolutely convinced you can afford the debt. Properly presented finances help them feel comfortable with the investment.</p>\n<h3>Improving your position</h3>\n<p>Remember, your accountant works for you. While we are obliged to be truthful and professional, we will work with you to try to achieve your end goals. With respect to a mortgage application, you may be looking to maximise your possible mortgage size and buying power &#8211; an accountant can help you do that.</p>\n<p>Mortgage size depends strongly on two factors &#8211; your income and your affordability checks. Both are somewhat changeable when you are self-employed and your money fluctuates from month to month, so it is important to look properly at your business cashflow and look in-depth at what should be presented to the lender to maximise your chances of a successful application.</p>\n<h2>Finding the right mortgage lender</h2>\n<p>While we don’t recommend any particular lender, we do advise that you seek out a specialist mortgage broker or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-enquiry-contact-page/\">advisory service</a>. Rather than a bank, an independent broker will be able to talk to multiple specialist lenders and help you find one that understands the specific needs of a self-employed or company-owner applicant.</p>\n<p>There are many specialist mortgage lenders across the UK who are more able to properly assess your personal circumstances through independent underwriting than the firmer rules that many of the well-known banks employ.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a broker in mind, we would be happy to provide a recommendation here, to help you.</p>\n<h2>Other factors</h2>\n<p>Remember that getting a mortgage requires more than simply a good set of accounts. The following factors are all things you should consider before making a mortgage application:</p>\n<h3>The length of time you have been in business</h3>\n<p>Simply put, the longer you have been running your business, the greater the chance of mortgage lenders being willing to offer a loan. Historically, self-employed people have had to wait until they can present a full three-year accounting history before making a successful mortgage application, but that is no longer the case, with many lenders willing to consider applications from people at any stage of their business.</p>\n<p>A willingness to consider does not mean a guaranteed successful application,  so if you are able to wait and put more months of solid reporting and accounting behind you, you will improve your chance of a good mortgage deal.</p>\n<h3>Your credit history</h3>\n<p>Nothing harms a mortgage application more than a poor personal credit score. Again, with a lot of competition for mortgages and the right mortgage broker, there are specialist lenders who are willing to lend to those with CCJs or even bankruptcies on their file, but these things don’t help.</p>\n<p>When you realise that you are on something of a back foot due to being self-employed, adding another consideration like bad credit to the mix can put you in a very tight corner.</p>\n<p>If you do have a poor personal credit score, we do advise that you hold off on your mortgage until you can improve it and present yourself in the future as a far lower risk.</p>\n<h3>Your tax set up</h3>\n<p>There are many ways to set up your income as a shareholder in a limited company with different tax advantages and disadvantages. One might be to receive a smaller regular salary and rely more heavily on company dividends for your income, shifting the balance towards corporation tax rather than <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal income tax</a>.</p>\n<p>While this is a perfectly legitimate way to run your business, it can present your personal income as being low &#8211; and remember you will be buying the property personally, not through your business.</p>\n<p>This has the effect of lowering your maximum mortgage size and can hinder your application. For that reason, it is worth discussing your desire to obtain a mortgage with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, so that we can ensure your salary and tax accounting is set up more favourably for a future mortgage application.</p>\n<h3>Joint applications</h3>\n<p>If you are married, in a civil partnership, or living with a partner, your mortgage lender will expect you to apply for a joint mortgage. If that same partner doesn’t have an independent career but works alongside you in some capacity in your business, then it may affect your mortgage application as the lender’s risk is increased.</p>\n<p>Being prepared and understanding the situation can help increase the chance of your success in buying a property, so be sure to discuss your mortgage with your partner and with us from an early stage so that any adjustments that may help your application can be made as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>Raising a deposit</h3>\n<p>Some lenders are willing to offer 95% LTV (loan to value) mortgages, meaning you only need a 5% deposit; however, this is unlikely to be the case with a self-employed mortgage. We advise strongly that you prepare for a 10% or even 15% deposit request from the lender and save accordingly.</p>\n<h2>A self-certified mortgage</h2>\n<p>In the past, it was possible to get a mortgage through self-certification. This was a typical way for a self-employed person to avoid the rejection and complexity of a standard mortgage application.</p>\n<p>Through self-certification, you essentially signed a document that stated that you could make the regular mortgage repayments and were willing to take the risk on personally. Self-certification mortgages obviously have many flaws and were in a large part responsible for some of the financial instability during 2007/08.</p>\n<p>Consequently, they were withdrawn from the financial market in the UK soon after the crash and are not available today.</p>\n<p>If you do come across a self-certification mortgage (from a foreign lender, for example) then we advise steering away from the situation and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">contacting us</a> or a certified mortgage advisor to work towards a more secure and regulated loan.</p>\n<h2>Self-employed mortgage help from Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Our team are experienced in helping small business owners, contractors, freelancers and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> in presenting their accounts with a view to obtaining a mortgage.

      "content": "<p>When you are self-employed, whether that be as a contractor, sole trader, agency worker or director of your own limited company, it is beneficial to maximise your tax allowance and bring your tax down to a manageable level that allows you to grow the business and make it profitable enough that you can afford to continue.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>One area that many small business owners overlook is that of properly utilising a spouse or partner. Despite them being alongside you for every step of your career and business journey, they can be overlooked both in terms of the value of their involvement, and the potential tax savings that come from making official something that is already happening.</p>\n<h2>A business partner in all but name</h2>\n<p>Running a small business can be a lonely and difficult job, so it’s no surprise that you turn to your husband or wife to share your stories, worries and problems. How often is it that they are able to cut through the fog and make sense of something in minutes that you have been struggling with for hours or even days? How regularly do they help you with your scheduling, work through some of your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-administrative-and-pa-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">administrative paperwork</a> or bring new ideas to further your business?</p>\n<p>Many smaller enterprises are actually more collaborative than their owners think!</p>\n<p>If your spouse is acting as an uncredited business partner, then it’s very reasonable that their work is paid for, and in doing so, you can make sure that your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">personal tax allowances</a> are optimised.</p>\n<h2>The marriage allowance</h2>\n<p>A provision already exists from HMRC that allows some of the unused <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax allowance</a> assigned to a spouse to be used in favour of the working partner. The marriage allowance allows for £1,250 of the lower earning spouse’s personal allowance to be transferred to the higher earning spouse.</p>\n<p>In reality, however, this only means an annual saving of £250 in tax, and it doesn’t credit your spouse with any actual involvement in the business.</p>\n<h2>Invoicing a spouse when self-employed</h2>\n<p>If your spouse does work alongside you uncredited, then they can invoice you for this work and become self-employed themselves, making full use of their entire personal allowance and not just the 10% dictated by the marriage allowance.</p>\n<p>There is a little more paperwork involved, as the second partner must also be properly registered with the tax office as self-employed and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">maintain annual tax returns</a>, but it’s a small cost when compared to the potential savings in tax.</p>\n<p>The input from the lower-earning partner may seem small but added up properly it can be quite substantial. Five hours of work a week is reasonably valued at £75 or more, depending on the specialisation of the work. This can become £300 or more a month in declared earnings, and almost £4,000 per year. This small level of change would represent a saving of £800 a year in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">self-employed income tax</a> with absolutely no alteration to household earnings.</p>\n<h2>Growing the business &#8211; from sole trader to limited company</h2>\n<p>For many self-employed businesses, the time soon comes where a progression to a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> is beneficial. At this stage, too, it could be advantageous to include your spouse or civil partner as a business partner, sharing the ownership of the business and splitting the responsibilities.</p>\n<p>While the tax options for a limited company are more varied, with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">different structures</a> of set-up possible, the core remains true that your spouse’s personal allowance should not go unused.</p>\n<p>Speak to us at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> for help in moving your business from a sole trader basis to a more structured limited company.</p>\n<h2>Involving a full-time employed spouse or civil partner</h2>\n<p>In many cases, your spouse will have a career path of their own, and if they are employed full-time, there may be no <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax allowance</a> remaining to take advantage of, nonetheless there could be other reasons why it is worth officially involving them into your business.</p>\n<p>Why not have a chat to us at Black and White Accounting about the options that are available to you &#8211; not only could you potentially save thousands on your tax bill, but you could discover a business structure that brings additional advantages to your workload and efficiency.</p>\n<p>Fill out our contact form for a no-obligation conversation, or simply pick up the phone and call <a href=\"tel:08001404644\">0800 140 4644</a> today!</p>\n",

If you are not sure, here are our top ten actions you should consider to reduce the amount of tax you will end up paying in the 2019/20 tax year.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Use your ISA Allowance for 2019/20</h2>\n<p>The tax-free ISA allowance is £20,000. Invest before the tax year has ended as the allowance does not rollover into the next tax year.</p>\n<h2>2. Increase your children’s savings</h2>\n<p>Junior ISAs for children provide a tax-free ISA allowance of £4,368 and can be a mix of cash and shares.</p>\n<h2>3. Top up your pension</h2>\n<p>Using your pension allowance can reduce the amount of earnings you get taxed on. You can put a maximum of £40,000 per tax year into your pension (as long as this does not exceed your earnings). If you have not used your allowance this can be carried forward for up to 3 years. SEIS/EIS/VCT investments should also be considered to potentially <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">reduce your income tax</a>.</p>\n<h2>4. Use your Capital Allowance</h2>\n<p>If you need to buy a capital asset you can use your capital allowance as a tax efficient means of doing so. Annual Investment Allowances (AIAs) are an example of a capital allowance and if an asset qualifies under the AIAs, you can deduct the full value of the item from your profits in the year in which you invest.</p>\n<h2>5. Make charitable donations</h2>\n<p>Tax relief on donations can be received through Gift Aid or Payroll Giving, which comes direct from your wages.</p>\n<h2>6. Take company dividends</h2>\n<p>To maximise your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax allowance</a>, your company can issue dividends to a maximum of £2,000 free of income tax. Your company will need to pay these before the 5th April 2020 to ensure they are included in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your self-assessment tax return</a> for 2019/20. Dividends above this are taxable at 7.5% (basic rate taxpayers), 32.5% (higher rate taxpayers) and 38.1% (additional rate taxpayers). We have assumed that you already have a PAYE scheme in place, where you don&#8217;t already use up your personal allowance with other earnings.</p>\n<p>When considering company dividends as a strategy, time is of the essence. Distribute dividends before 5th April 2020 to utilise your personal tax allowance effectively. Engaging with a professional <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">local self-assessment accountant</a> can ensure proper compliance and optimal tax planning.</p>\n<h2>7. Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h2>\n<p>You can make £12,000 in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">capital gains</a> this tax year before you pay tax, known as the ‘annual exemption’. If you have assets to sell or shares to dispose of, think about the timing of this. Maybe you need to consider spreading this over two tax years? Don&#8217;t forget the changes in CGT on properties coming from next tax year, so you might want to consider selling before this (if possible).</p>\n<h2>8. Research &amp; Development tax relief (R&amp;D)</h2>\n<p>If your business is involved in the advancement of science and technology or has project(s) or activit(ies) that help resolve scientific or technological uncertainties, you may be able to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">claim R&amp;D tax credits</a>. For SMEs, this comes as an additional 130% deduction (in addition to the original claimed cost), or claim cash back at 14.5%, where losses are being made. This can help accelerate the growth of your business, or simply reduce/wipe out any <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax due</a>. This is applied for by a report for inclusion in the company tax return, which you can do for the current and the previous years.</p>\n<h2>9. Limit Inheritance Tax (IHT)</h2>\n<p>You can give up to £3,000 per annum worth of gifts each tax year, which will not be included in the value of your estate, known as the ‘annual exemption’, like <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">Capital Gains Tax</a>. Each tax year, you can also give away:<br />\na. wedding or civil ceremony gifts of up to £1,000 per person (£2,500 for a grandchild or great-grandchild, £5,000 for a child);<br />\nb. normal gifts out of your income, for example Christmas or birthday presents – as long as you can maintain your standard of living after making the gift;<br />\nc. payments to help with another person’s living costs, such as an elderly relative or a child under 18; and/or<br />\nd. gifts to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/support-for-charities-and-other-coronavirus-support-update/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"43\">charities</a> and political parties.</p>\n<h2>10. File your tax return quickly</h2>\n<p>Complete your tax return soon after the 5th April 2020 and know what tax you need to pay and any possible refund (especially for those who pay CIS). Keep records up to date to help you do this.

      "content": "<p>According to the Federation of Small Businesses there were 5.8 million small businesses operating at the start of 2019. These contribute significantly to the UK economy and at Black and White Accounting, we’re proud to be playing our part to support and help them flourish.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>So, at the start of 2020, I’d like to look at some of the likely challenges Small and Medium Enterprises (&#8216;SMEs&#8217;) are likely to face in the year ahead:</p>\n<h2>1. After Brexit, what next?</h2>\n<p>Brexit is happening on the 31 January and while this now provides clarity for the direction of the UK, the actual impact is still unclear. What will future trading arrangements with Europe and the rest of the world look like? What talent will come to the UK and from where? How long will it take to negotiate new trade deals? It seems that businesses may need to continue to ride the wave of uncertainty for a while longer, which in turn may have a broader economic impact.</p>\n<h2>2. IT Security</h2>\n<p>Small and medium sized businesses don’t always have the specialist knowledge to set up and review IT security and run the risk of coming under a cyber-attack. The cost of this to a business isn’t just financial; business reputation and the confidence of clients can be severely harmed. Developing your resilience to these and understanding your legal obligations regarding data protection, especially in a post-GDPR world, will continue to challenge many businesses.</p>\n<h2>3. Environmental responsibility</h2>\n<p>The drive for shared responsibility to tackle environmental issues will continue into 2020 and businesses may need to prepare for regulatory changes to encourage greater corporate responsibility for managing their impact on the environment. This may include customer demands from businesses to demonstrate their corporate responsibility or risk losing their business. A recent blog of ours looked at ways to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/save-taxes-and-planet/\">save tax and the environment</a> at the same time.</p>\n<h2>4. Generating new customers</h2>\n<p>Being proactive is crucial for generating new customers, which takes strategy and planning. Many businesses understand their customers’ needs but helping the customers realise their need for your product or services, can require a different set of skills. To remain competitive, it will be essential to develop approaches within a changing political and economic background and potentially develop new skills within the business.</p>\n<h2>5. The importance of social media</h2>\n<p>The continued growth and impact of social media makes it integral for many businesses looking to increase brand awareness, connect with customers and reach out to new ones. The breadth of engagement that social media can generate makes it a powerful and relatively cost-effective tool, but the social media landscape is evolving, together with the way in which people engage with it. It’s imperative for businesses that wish to capitalise on the potential of social media to keep pace with changing trends. IT Security and Data Protection however, also remain pertinent here. We as a business are on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blackandwhiteacc/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/black-&amp;-white-chartered-certified-accountants/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BandWAccounting\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhv1r4djc0ZoqPt-M_mcrg\">YouTube</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bandwaccountants/\">Instagram</a>..,</p>\n<h2>Sense of optimism</h2>\n<p>Despite these potential trends, I feel that small businesses do have a sense of optimism for 2020, with 86% saying that they’re confident they will achieve their main goal. However, to help achieve their targets, agility and development will remain key.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Chartered Accountants</h2>\n<p>We want to get to know you, your business and your exit strategy, so we can set you on the right path and support you every step of the way.</p>\n<p>If you would like to discuss any business opportunities or challenges which are keeping you awake at night and how they may impact on your business in 2020, our specialist team are waiting for you to get in touch with us. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, populate the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "excerpt": "Last year it was widely reported that more money was spent by consumers with retailers on card rather than cash transaction.

A British Retail Consortium (BRC) survey showed that only £1 in every five spent in shops is in cash compared to credit, debit and store cards. Sweden is predicted to become cashless society by 2023, with other countries hot on their tails.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Is this the beginning of a cashless economy and if so, is it a problem for businesses or consumers if we don’t have cash anymore?</p>\n<h2>The benefits of paying with cash</h2>\n<p>If you are an enthusiastic adopter of digital transactions and rarely use cash, it may not seem a difficult leap into a cashless society but there still some advantage to using cash:</p>\n<p>• It’s a fast and convenient way to pay;<br />\n• Cash payments are anonymous (although it can also help fund crime);<br />\n• It’s widely accepted;<br />\n• People find cash helpful with weekly budget management;<br />\n• It’s still easy to access cash; and<br />\n• Not everybody has a bank account.</p>\n<h2>What are the challenges of a cashless society?</h2>\n<p>The introduction of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-can-ai-help-my-business-in-2025/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"17\">new technologies</a> has facilitated a move towards a cashless society, but this may not be enough to justify a full transition to no-cash, which could present some challenges, including:</p>\n<p>• Areas affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity may struggle with online transactions;<br />\n• People with physical or mental health problems can find digital options harder;<br />\n• People on low incomes are most likely to be negatively impacted; and<br />\n• The risk of online fraud is significant and increasing.</p>\n<p>A mind shift is also needed among the public, as the Access to Cash Report found:<br />\n• 63% of people said holding money makes them think more about spending it;<br />\n• 60% say we would have less privacy;<br />\n• 74% would feel more susceptible to cyber-attacks; and<br />\n• 74% feel it takes away right to choose.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of a cashless society?</h2>\n<p>The introduction of cashless transactions has highlighted benefits, so it’s not difficult to see how these could be perpetuated by a cashless society. For example:</p>\n<p>• Potentially less crime, as cash is easy to steal, and illegal transactions tend to be cash-based;<br />\n• Digital transactions are convenient;<br />\n• It’s harder to hide financial crimes as there is a paper trail;<br />\n• No need to print money, manage cash storage, move money around;<br />\n• International payments are easier if cashless; and<br />\n• Easier to manage lost cards than retrieve lost cash.</p>\n<p>For businesses, going cashless will present challenges and opportunities. Investment in new infrastructure will be needed and there are costs around every card transaction, but accounting, finance management and tax payments could become seamless and less time-consuming. Ultimately, customers also like the convenience. There is a lot of exciting software and technology now coming to support this, which can make your time more efficient and improve your customer journey, so it can be a win-win.</p>\n<h2>So, what’s next, cash or cashless?</h2>\n<p>Cash is an economic necessity for approximately 47% of the population in the UK and a significant proportion are also unsure how they would cope in a cashless economy. What is important now is whether becoming a cashless society will be a revolution, a sudden and disruptive change which some people may struggle to keep pace with, or a gradual process of change allowing people and businesses to evolve.</p>\n<p>The Access to Cash Review suggests that the transition to a cashless society could be a gentler, progressive process, and is calling on the Government, regulators and banks to act now to avoid leaving anyone behind. Whatever happens, times are changing for cash.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Every challenge is an opportunity to differentiate yourself from the crowd. Whilst it is not without its challenges, the move to a more cashless society can help both you and your customers if you have the right strategy.</p>\n<p>If you would like to discuss this, or any other business challenges or opportunities you’re concerned with, our specialist team are ready and waiting for you. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, populate the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Approximately 9.9 million adults in the UK own dogs, which is around 26% of UK adults. Dogs noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals, which they lick to sample. A bloodhound has such a good sense of smell that it can be used in a court of law. Three dogs even survived the Titanic. I could go on…</p>\n<p><!--more-->As interesting as this, is your dog tax deductible and able to be claimed as a business expense?  And if so, when and how much can you claim? Not only are there many different breeds of dog, they also have many different roles to play and the tax consequences differ as a result, be they working dogs, guard dogs, office dogs, therapy dogs or assistance dogs.</p>\n<p>The basis for the treatment comes down to the basic tax principle; is the expense incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business? This will determine if none, part or all of the expenses incurred can be claimed as a legitimate business case. Each circumstance should be examined on a case-by-case basis, but below we explore more about the general principals.</p>\n<h2>Working dogs</h2>\n<p>Starting with the easiest one. If you have a working dog, such as a farm or guard dog, the ongoing care costs of looking after them are potentially allowable.</p>\n<p>The costs purchasing them can even be treated as ‘plant’ for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">capital allowance purposes</a>, so you get full relief for the costs of purchasing them.</p>\n<p>VAT can also be recovered on the costs of feed and vet bills, if the business is VAT registered.</p>\n<p>The complexity comes where the dog forms part of the family and for example lives in the family home. However, this is normally treated as incidental to their role as a working dog, so shouldn’t impact the tax treatment.</p>\n<p>Did you know that where farm employees are required to keep a dog(s) as part of their duties, they can claim a weekly dog allowance of £7.63 per dog per week, which is not subject to tax. Nice!</p>\n<h2>Guard dogs</h2>\n<p>Now whilst a guard dog, required to keep your business premises safe can of course be a business expense, you also need to be realistic. I’m not sure for example how good a Chihuahua would be at this role. Pardon the pun but their bark is definitely worse than their bite.</p>\n<p>As with working dogs, they can be treated as ‘plant’ for capital allowance purposes, if indeed they are guard dogs.</p>\n<p>The fun comes somewhere between a Rottweiler and a Chihuahua, especially where the dog is both a guard dog and a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pup-party-at-black-white-accounting/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"80\">family pet</a>. Some may look to apportion costs between work and personal, but this could be difficult to defend with HMRC. If asked would you consider your dog to be a guard dog or a family pet?</p>\n<h2>Office dogs</h2>\n<p>There is a lot of support that having dogs in the workforce can be a low-cost and effective way to boost well-being and productivity.</p>\n<p>However, if it belongs to the boss and goes home with the boss (AKA doggie day care), it would be very difficult to argue that any costs incurred are for the business, as great as it can be for social media, they are likely to be considered a pet, so their costs cannot be claimed against the business.</p>\n<h2>Therapy Dogs</h2>\n<p>Pets can be a key part of therapy in care homes, hospitals and schools to name but a few places. If you are self-employed and use a dog for this very reason with the large amount of expenses for them to be suitable for this specialised role, there may be a case here for their expenses to be deducted against your business.</p>\n<p>There are other indicators for the dog being used for therapy. For example, is it a special breed particularly suitable for such a role, does it have special training, do you advertise the dog as part of the therapy you provide, does the dog have regular rest breaks and do patients request the dog?</p>\n<p>Here if the dog is taken home at the end of a working day, it can be considered incidental, as with Working dogs above.</p>\n<h2>Assistance dogs</h2>\n<p>HMRC has clear guidance for blind employees who have guide dogs at their own expense in order to perform their duties as employees. Here reasonable costs of keeping and replacing the guide dog can be claimed but allocations between business and private use shouldn’t be made.</p>\n<p>Whilst HMRC Manuals are not as clear for hearing and other assistance dogs, where the dogs are highly trained and required for an employee to perform their role, the same rules are likely to apply.<br />\nSimilarly, there is no clear guidance for self-employed individuals, it would be hard to argue the case would be any different to employees.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Tax isn’t always simple; not only is there the tax legislation, there is also a mammoth amount of tax cases in which to navigate in order to keep you on the right side of the law. That’s why having an Accountant as your business partner is key to you continuing to succeed; not paying more tax than you need to, but also not taking unnecessary risks either. It’s a short leash and we want to keep you out of HMRC’s doghouse.

      "content": "<p>Growing a business requires capital investment. No matter the central focus to your business, and the sector it is in, this one fact remains true. Capital represents many things, from the obvious ability to employ additional staff, find suitable premises, or upgrade equipment to the more abstract, like freeing up your time to focus on client acquisition or product development.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Finding the right source for capital investment is important. Simply jumping at the first offer for money that is available is a desperate move that can lead to a limited future situation, and what’s right for one business model isn’t necessarily good for another.</p>\n<p>Getting investment from a third party typically involves giving up a portion of your control and (potential) future profits &#8211; off putting for many. If you want to keep complete control over your business, at some point you may need to consider a business loan.</p>\n<p>Is taking out a loan the right thing to do? What is the right time to do so? What products are potentially available to you? These are just a few of the key questions. Whilst this is a fast-evolving sector, the points highlighted below are general trends at the time of writing and of course subject to regular change.</p>\n<h2>Types of business loans</h2>\n<p>When we think of a loan, it’s normally a cash injection from a bank or similar organisation that must be repaid with interest on a monthly basis. That is, indeed, one of the options available. However, a standard unsecured loan is only one type of finance option available to businesses in the UK, and there are many other products that may suit your needs better.</p>\n<h2>What is asset finance?</h2>\n<p>Whether you think you have or not, the chances are that asset finance is something you may already be using. Car leasing and even a standard mobile phone contract are both types of asset finance that are used by the public across the country, but there’s a lot more choice and a far wider range of applications than you may think.</p>\n<h3>Leasing</h3>\n<p>Leasing is a standard type of asset finance and can typically be thought of as a long-term hire arrangement. When you lease, you do not own the asset, but agree to make monthly payments for a set term, returning the asset at the end.</p>\n<p>The monthly leasing payment is often little more than the cost of depreciation on the asset with a fee on top for the leasing company’s administration and profit. When the contract term is over, the asset is sold at market value, making sure the leasing company do not lose money. For this reason, damage done to the asset during the lease is typically passed on to you as an extra penalty at the end.</p>\n<p>Car leasing is the best known form of asset leasing, but almost every business need is covered through this form of finance. It can include:</p>\n<h4>Technology leasing</h4>\n<p>Laptops, desktop computers, tablets and network infrastructure are all available from asset lease companies. Having the capital to invest in a new laptop might be a stretch for many small businesses, but a £20 per month outgoing is a lot easier to budget for.</p>\n<p>IT leasing also includes subscription to cloud-based services, so if you have a professional Dropbox account, you are already using IT asset finance!</p>\n<h4>Office furniture leasing</h4>\n<p>Fitting out a new office with desks and chairs can be a huge outlay, so it makes sense that leasing companies exist who are willing to turn a capital outlay into a spread monthly payment.</p>\n<h4>Construction equipment leasing</h4>\n<p>It is rare for a small building firm to own their own diggers or cranes. This specialised and expensive equipment is more often leased.</p>\n<h4>Vehicle leasing</h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/company-car-and-fuel-benefit-in-kind/\">company van for a tradesman</a>, or company car for client management &#8211; these are typical uses for vehicle leasing, and many companies, including the dealerships themselves, have leasing as an option.</p>\n<h4>Specialised equipment leasing</h4>\n<p>Dedicated asset finance companies exist who will be willing to outlay the capital for equipment that is very specialised to your specific sector or business and then lease it to you under contract. This can be especially useful if you have a fixed project that requires an expensive piece of equipment that you would not use elsewhere, allowing you to undertake the project without a major (and potentially wasteful) capital investment.</p>\n<h4>Premises leasing</h4>\n<p>Renting an office or warehouse space is a well-known form of asset leasing, essential for most businesses who cannot afford (nor want) a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mortgage-calculator/\">commercial mortgage</a>.</p>\n<h4>Short-term leasing</h4>\n<p>Most leasing is measured in years, with three years a standard length for a lease contract, however, short-term leasing is also available. Typically, this is more expensive per month, but allows you to take on a lease for as little as three months.</p>\n<h3>Secured loans</h3>\n<p>A secured loan is another type of asset finance. Here the intention is for you to own the asset permanently, and so a loan is taken out using the asset as security. Secured loans like this include mortgages (the asset is the property), and a car hire purchase agreement (the asset is the vehicle).</p>\n<p>With the right specialist lender, it is possible to obtain a secured loan against many different types of asset, from industrial equipment through to technology.</p>\n<p>A secured loan is considered a lower risk loan for the lender, and so it is often favourable in terms of interest rates but it is important to understand that defaulting on a secured loan will ultimately result in repossession of the asset and often additional costs (especially if the asset has depreciated significantly in the interim).</p>\n<p>Secured loans can be quite large, often representing a large portion of the asset value. Loan-to-value ratios as high as 90% can be found, especially with commercial mortgages and car finance.</p>\n<p>Many secured loans are structured with a large initial payment (often called the deposit), and a large final payment (the balloon payment) in order to keep the monthly repayment level low. Loan terms often stretch for many years, relative to the size of the borrowing, and fluctuating interest rates can affect the monthly repayment. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A standard repayment mortgage &#8211; variable deposit, relatively low monthly payment often affected by changing interest rates, very long term, no balloon payment.</li>\n<li>An interest-only mortgage &#8211; large deposit, low monthly payment affected by interest rates, long term, very large balloon payment.</li>\n<li>Car finance hire purchase &#8211; small deposit, low set monthly payment unaffected by interest rates, medium term, moderate balloon payment.</li>\n<li>Specialised equipment secured loan &#8211; moderate deposit, low set monthly payment unaffected by interest rates, short term, moderate balloon payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secured loans are often flexible in that they can be repaid early or renegotiated towards the end of term in order to extend the length of the loan. In some cases (such as a mortgage), refinancing to release equity in the asset is also possible.</p>\n<p>One type of secured loan familiar to most is a mobile phone contract that includes a handset, which is very similar to a hire purchase agreement.</p>\n<h3>Bridging loans</h3>\n<p>Bridging loans are very short term, high interest loans that are available to businesses looking to make a major purchase at short notice while securing other financing. While it is possible to consider bridging loans with a very negative view, used properly they form an important part of many business strategies.</p>\n<p>A bridging loan is a form of secured loan that is intended to be replaced with lower interest, responsible financing as soon as that is available. This <em>exit strategy</em> forms a key part to the loan itself and without a suitable level of replacement finance being planned for, the bridging loan itself will be rejected.</p>\n<p>Bridging loans tend to have interest leveraged on a daily basis, and are typically represented with a monthly, rather than annual, interest rate.</p>\n<p>Many bridging loans are used to purchase property, with a mortgage representing the exit strategy. As a mortgage can take months to put in place, use of a bridging loan allows for immediate purchasing. Mortgages also have more specific criteria that may be difficult to meet on the purchase date, but able to be fully considered some months later.</p>\n<p>As an example, take a run-down property that is available at auction for a low price, making it a good investment. Auctioned properties must be paid for in full within 28 days; often too short for a mortgage to be finalised. Additionally, the mortgage criteria will reject a building that is unsuitable for habitation. A bridging loan can be obtained quickly (often within 48 hours) and so can form a central part of the strategy.</p>\n<p>In this case, the property is purchased at auction and a bridging loan is taken out that will pay both for its asking price, and the cost of renovations. Three months of work is undertaken to bring the property up to specification and then a mortgage is applied for to pay off the bridging loan. With the property now a suitable asset for the mortgage lender, and its market value many times that of its original cost, the mortgage is easily agreed. The paperwork takes two months to complete and at five months after the original purchase, the bridging loan is paid off with interest and the property secured with a standard mortgage.</p>\n<p>Bridging loans are not just for property purchases however; they are also suitable for raising capital for a high-value business project, for example, allowing the employment of additional staff and covering other short term costs before the project can be invoiced (at which point the bridging loan is paid off in full).</p>\n<h2>What is an unsecured loan?</h2>\n<p>An unsecured loan is a much higher risk for a lender and in order to make sure that your business represents a reasonable investment, a lot will depend on the checks the lender can make regarding the business credit history and viability.</p>\n<p>Lenders offering unsecured loans to businesses will look at the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The businesses credit history;</li>\n<li>The personal credit report of the directors (if <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>) or you (if <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a>);</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">business plan</a>; and/or</li>\n<li>Recent business <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">accounts</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Negative credit history, such as CCJs or an previous insolvency, can heavily impact your ability to obtain an unsecured loan.</p>\n<p>Unsecured loans can be used for any business activity, from purchasing new equipment through to getting new staff &#8211; it is literally money loaned to you for your use as you see fit. However, if you have obtained a loan through a business plan proposal explaining how you intend to invest the capital, then it would be irresponsible for you to use it in other ways and could harm any future application for credit if misused.</p>\n<h3>Bank loans</h3>\n<p>Going to your bank to obtain a loan is a traditional way to finance your business investment. If you have a good history with your bank and a strong credit record, then often the bank does represent a good choice, although you should always look at other options on the market to see if you can secure a better rate.</p>\n<h3>Peer-to-peer lending</h3>\n<p>Growing in the marketplace, peer-to-peer loans represent a system whereby a group of anonymous investors provide loans to businesses at more competitive rates than traditional lenders. Peer-to-peer (P2P) loans are online-only systems that have their own risk assessment criteria to banks, with quick decision making and potentially more-suitable products for your business.</p>\n<p>Once secured, a P2P loan works in a standard fashion, with interest accrued and monthly repayments made until the loan is repaid in full.</p>\n<h3>Challenger bank loans</h3>\n<p>The rise of internet-only ‘challenger’ banks means there are more loan options in the business marketplace than ever before. Many challenger banks have a range of extra incentives to make their loans incredible competitive and worth looking at. Even if you don’t regularly bank with them, these loans are open for your application and, once using their service, you may find yourself wanting to switch over to them for all your business banking!</p>\n<h2>Credit cards</h2>\n<p>Business credit cards represent another way to obtain short-notice finance. Applied for in a similar way to any personal credit card, or unsecured loan, credit cards typically use similar criteria to a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">bank loan</a> regarding assessing your suitability as a borrower.</p>\n<p>Unlike a loan however, a credit card represents an ongoing line of credit, meaning that once you have repaid it, you can reuse the credit stream without reapplying. This can be incredibly useful for businesses, meaning there’s some short-term borrowing available for future use with no need to worry about application or waiting.</p>\n<p>Paying back a credit card in full is an important aspect of usage, however, as failure to do so will result in high interest charges and damage to your future credit score.</p>\n<p>Credit cards represent an excellent backup system for business capital flexibility but are rarely the right choice for long-term investment.</p>\n<h2>Overdraft facilities</h2>\n<p>Like a credit card, an overdraft facility represents ongoing credit that can help you through  difficult periods of business but shouldn’t be considered a long-term solution to any capital investment problems. Overdraft usage isn’t a positive influence on your credit card and is subject to both high levels of interest and additional fees.</p>\n<p>Having an overdraft facility, even if unused, can provide a level of mental security in case of any sudden need that helps you concentrate on your business rather than worrying about day-to-day cashflow.</p>\n<h2>Newer business-specific options</h2>\n<p>Finance companies offer a range of additional products aimed at businesses, many of which represent slightly different interpretations on the above products, but a few of which are genuinely useful ways for a business to obtain finance.</p>\n<h3>Invoice loans</h3>\n<p>An invoice-based loan is a product available for businesses who have small to medium cashflow issues, typically due to expansion.</p>\n<p>With an invoice loan, the lender will make a cash sum available to a business based on work that has already been invoiced but not yet paid by the client. Upon payment, the loan, fees and interest are repaid. Essentially, the system is designed to facilitate the effective immediate payment of invoices and is especially useful when clients have 30, 60 or even 90-day invoice payment terms.</p>\n<p>Invoice loans require an extra level of credit checking &#8211; namely that of the end client who will be paying the invoice. Lenders will be keen to see previous invoices paid by the same client without a problem and will perform a soft credit search on the client. AKA a smart search, the search it leaves on your credit file cannot be seen by other lenders so won’t affect your credit score or affect a potential lender’s decision if another search is done at a later date.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the size of the invoice loan is dependent on the amounts invoiced, with many loans at the 60% LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. Thus, an invoice of £10,000 would be likely to raise £6,000 cash in advance.</p>\n<h3>Merchant cash advance</h3>\n<p>Relatively new to the finance world, a merchant cash advance represents a loan offered to businesses that make a large number of small payment transactions (such as shops or online stores). The loans are repaid by the lender taking a percentage of all payments made until the loan is settled.</p>\n<p>This type of loan is especially useful for businesses with fluctuating income, as during a good period, more of the loan will be repaid, but there is no pressure in more difficult times to meet a set monthly repayment.</p>\n<p>The size of merchant cash advance loans is limited to the monthly turnover of the business, and you will need to show complete accounting records to the lender to secure the loan.</p>\n<h3>Business cash advance</h3>\n<p>Like a merchant cash advance, a business cash advance is a loan with a flexible repayment method which is  based on the business income each month. Rather than a set sum to be budgeted for, business cash advance loans are paid back as a percentage of monthly turnover. This has the effect of stress-free borrowing during quieter months and requiring larger repayments during busier months and is often an excellent choice for smaller, growing businesses.</p>\n<p>Again, you will be expected to provide full accounts and the loan size will be relative to historically proven turnover.</p>\n<h2>Update &#8211; Coronavirus crisis</h2>\n<p>During the Coronavirus crisis, three specific schemes have been set up to support businesses through the <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/\">British Business Bank</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Scheme (CBBLS): available from May 2020 Small businesses are to have access to loans up to £50,000, 100% backed by the Government, by filling out a simple two-page self-certification form online:</li>\n<li>Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS): Offering SMEs loans up to £5m, interest-free up to 12 months and personal guarantee free for up to £250,000; and</li>\n<li>Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS): ensures that more firms are able to benefit from government-backed support during this difficult time. It provides a government guarantee of 80% to enable banks to make loans of up to £50 million to firms with an annual turnover above £45 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The structure and term of each of these loans vary, so we hope this article could be some help in trying to understand what is best for your business to survive the current crisis, then thrive afterwards.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, there is a lot of concession measures to support individuals and their businesses, including payment holidays or deferrals in payment on mortgages, loans, store cards and credit cards as well as reduced rates and greater flexibility on overdrafts. If you are not already being offered these by you existing lender, we suggest that you request it from them, or consider switching your services for improved terms, if possible.</p>\n<h2>Help from Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Taking out a loan is a serious consideration. While it can provide a cash injection when you need it, the repayments can have a significant impact on your monthly finances for many months to come.

The Chancellor has been in his job for less than a month. Not only did he have to try and keep the Traditional Conservative’s happy after a strong victory in the recent General Elections, he also had to appeal to the traditionally Labour seats which recently ‘lent’ their votes to the Conservatives in order to boost their changes of retaining those seats in the future. In addition to that, is the outlook of low growth, Brexit and Coronavirus; no biggies.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Here is a brief summary of what came out of today’s Budget:</p>\n<h2><strong>Economic Climate</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Economic growth sinks from previously predicted 1.4% to 1.1% this year, before the impact of Coronavirus.</li>\n<li>Borrowing projected to increase from £33.3bn to £60.2bn in 2023/24, with Treasury to review ‘Fiscal Rules’ limiting borrowing in July.</li>\n<li>Debt projected to remain high at 75.2% of GDP in 2024/25, before factoring in Coronavirus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Coronavirus Update</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>£30bn package to combat Coronavirus outbreak, including £5bn emergency fund to support NHS and other public services in England.</li>\n<li>Those advised to self-isolate will be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-pay/\">entitled to statutory sick pay</a>, as previously announced. However, it was added that this would apply even if they have not presented with symptoms.</li>\n<li>The self-employed will be able to claim contributory Employment Support Allowance, which they are normally not eligible for. This benefit will be available from day one, rather than after a week.</li>\n<li>Firms with less than 250 staff will be refunded for sick pay payments for two weeks and be able to access “business interruption” loans of up to £1.2m.</li>\n<li>More widely, £6bn of ‘new’ NHS funding for staff recruitment and hospital upgrades, including £100m in 2020/21 for Boris Johnson’s ‘new’ hospitals and increase in Immigration Health Surcharge to £624 a year for non-UK nationals to use NHS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Individuals</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Headline winner was no <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">national insurance contributions</a> on the first £9,500 of earnings (currently £8,632), as expected. First announced in November, this will take 500,000 employees out of tax altogether, although it will only save everyone else around £85 a year.</li>\n<li>Inheritance threshold from April 2020 will hit £500,000, making the tax-free amount for married couples £1m, as previously announced.</li>\n<li>The allowance for Junior ISAs and Child <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/trust-fund-accounting-services/\">Trust Funds</a> will be increased from £4,368 to £9,000 from April. However, the typical amount saved currently is only £1,000.</li>\n<li>As widely reported, the Tampon Tax will finally be abolished after years of campaigning. The Reduced Rate of 5% VAT will vanish from January 2021.</li>\n<li>Those on higher earnings, including doctors and nurses earning under £200,000 can now work overtime without it affecting their pension.</li>\n<li>New Neo-natal pay and entitlement of £160 per week for up to 12 weeks for parents of sick new-born babies.</li>\n<li>Up to 60 days breathing space for those with debt problems from 2021.</li>\n<li>End of the benefit freeze, with working age benefits to rise by 1.7% in April, although this is still below inflation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Businesses</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The headline for us here was the abolition of business rates in England in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors, with a rateable value below £51,000. Pubs will also get a bigger discount from £1,000 this year to £5,000. Small businesses can claim £3,000 cash grant, with further announcements on rates expected later this year.</li>\n<li>The big surprise today (well every Budget Day) was Entrepreneurs Relief will be retained, but the lifetime allowance will be reduced from £10m to £1m. The Chancellor believes this should not materially reduce the incentive to start and build businesses, with 80% of businesses unaffected.</li>\n<li>Those working from home, who claim £4 a week off their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">income tax bill</a>, will be able to claim £6 from April.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/minimum-wage/\">Minimum wages per hour</a> will increase significantly from 1 April 2020 to:\n<ul>\n<li>Over-25s: £8.72 (currently: £8.21);</li>\n<li>21 to 24: £8.20 (currently: £7.70);</li>\n<li>18 to 20: £6.45 (currently: £6.15);</li>\n<li>Under 18: £4.55 (currently: £4.35); and</li>\n<li>Apprenticeships: £4.15 (currently: £3.90).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The National Living Wage will reach two-thirds of median earnings by 2024 &#8211; forecasting a wage for over-25s of £10.50 an hour.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation tax</a> cut to 17% was cancelled, as previously announced.

      "content": "<p>As the dust settles and the detail emerges from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020\">March 2020 Budget</a>, we wanted to share the key takeaways for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). There have also been some additional updates since this, which are captured here.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>A more complete summary of the Budget can be found <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/2020-budget/\">here</a>. Please be mindful however that some of this has been superseded by the £330bn+ stimulus package announced by the Government on 17<sup>th</sup> March 2020. These additional policies, as much as is currently known, are captured below.</p>\n<p>Whilst it is good to see some movement in the right direction here, and potentially more to follow, there is still a need for more support of the self-employed and workers alike.</p>\n<h2><strong>Rates Relief</strong></h2>\n<p>Small businesses can claim £10,000 (previously £3,000 cash grant in the budget), with further announcements on rates expected later this year. It is not clear on the mechanism for doing this however and we recommend you speak to your local rates office to find out more, although it should become clear in the next two to four weeks. One such office said that this should be an automatic process, which wouldn’t require an application, but we await confirmation if this is indeed the case.</p>\n<p>There is more specific relief in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors here and more to come.</p>\n<h2><strong>Business Interruption Loan</strong></h2>\n<p>There will be a special loan available for Small companies who are hit by the Coronavirus, as a temporary Business Interruption Loan.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/\">British Business Bank</a> will deliver the loan scheme, which “will be in place in a matter of weeks” to support SMEs to access bank lending and overdrafts. Interest rates will be similar to current bank lending as the Government will forgo their 2% premium which they charge on the similar Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (‘EFG’).</p>\n<p>Essentially the Government will provide the lenders with an 80% guarantee of the loan, with the lending provided by a pool of lenders, supporting loans of up to £1.2m per small business (with anticipated total lending here to hit £1.2bn). We believe this is going to be extended as part of the £330bn package, but details have not been released yet. There also might be specific help available here for the aviation industry.</p>\n<p>However, ultimately this is a loan and it will still need to be repaid, it’s not the simplest and it’s not been launched yet so it is unclear how helpful this might be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tax helpline</strong></h2>\n<p>HMRC have set up a specialised <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tax-helpline-to-support-businesses-affected-by-coronavirus-covid-19\">helpline</a> and employed 2,000 specialised staff to help support businesses and the self-employed concerned they will not be able to pay their tax on time, specifically due to the coronavirus. In additional to practical help and support, if you are unable to pay your tax as it falls due, they can explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>agreeing an instalment arrangements;</li>\n<li>suspending debt collection proceedings; and/or</li>\n<li>cancelling penalties and interest where you have administrative difficulties contacting or paying HMRC immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their scope is therefore above and beyond what can be provided as part of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-how-to-pay-a-debt-to-hmrc-with-a-time-to-pay-arrangement\">time to pay</a> agreement, so if you need to, we suggest you get in touch with them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Their opening hours are Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm, and Saturday 8am to 4pm, and they are often less busy first thing and last thing.</p>\n<h2><strong>IR35</strong></h2>\n<p>Effective from 6<sup>th</sup> April 2020, contractors working through Personal Service Companies for Medium and Large end clients’ were to have their IR35 status established by their end clients’, in line with the previous changes to the Public Sector. Small end clients’ remain outside the scope of these changes.</p>\n<p>Sensationally last night it was announced that the reforms to IR35 will be delayed by 12 months, due to pressure from the House of Lords and coronavirus.</p>\n<p>If this had been changed six or nine months ago, this would be the headline winner. However, to put it simply this is too little to late for many contractors who have already lost their roles, been forced into PAYE positions and often been hounded by HMRC.</p>\n<p>It is also a deferral and the government remain committed to its reform, at least at this stage. This group in particular are likely to be the first to lose their roles as businesses make tough decisions.</p>\n<h2><strong>Research &amp; Development </strong></h2>\n<p>Whilst there is limited good news for smaller businesses here, SMEs who claim some of their relief under the large company scheme (for example for work undertaken for large companies) will see the RDEC increase from 12% to 13%. We would have liked to have seen improvements to the SME rates, but we can’t have everything.</p>\n<p>However, if you have a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>, I would think long and hard if have any genuine advancements in science or technology as part of your business, which incur costs. The relief remains very generous, for HMRC the claims are processed quickly, and it could wipe out your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a> / general a loss / refund position.</p>\n<p>Consider leveraging the generous <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">R&amp;D tax credits</a>, especially if you&#8217;re a limited company engaged in genuine advancements in science or technology.</p>\n<h2>Entrepreneurs Relief</h2>\n<p>One of the surprises of the day that for those potentially looking to sell their business in the foreseeable future, the good news was that Entrepreneurs Relief will be retained. Although the lifetime allowance will be reduced from £10m to £1m.</p>\n<p>Here the owners of businesses can pay tax at just 10%, on the sale of qualifying assets, subject to certain conditions.</p>\n<p>The Chancellor believes this should not materially reduce the incentive to start and build businesses, with 80% of businesses unaffected. The relief is that it is still available. It won&#8217;t help you day-to-day, but at least you will still get the benefit from all your hard work.</p>\n<h2><strong>Other tips</strong></h2>\n<p>At this difficult time we all need to come together to support and help one another. Other than the above schemes, there are also a few things you might be able to do to help your business, above and beyond the government schemes mentioned above. These can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act now, plan, prepare and be ready, whatever the scenario;</li>\n<li>Prepare cashflow models for your business, to understand how your position is looking and when your issues will arise under different scenarios;</li>\n<li>Go through your profit and loss account; are there any costs you can strip out? Today, next week, next month? Do you need to set the ball-rolling now, especially as some services require a notice period?;</li>\n<li>If you have a landlord (for business or personal) talk to them and see if there is any flexibility in your current arrangement. They are potentially getting relief, maybe they can pass this along to you to keep you as a tenant?;</li>\n<li>Manage your debtors and creditors. Don’t pay anyone before you need to and get money in from your customers as quickly as you can. Maybe look to see if you can extend credit terms, payment days or put things on direct debit to spread payments and ultimately improve your working capital;</li>\n<li>If you have any lenders, keep communicating. If you are going to have any issues with payment, the earlier you communicate the better. However, you never know, they may be able to accept delay payments, payment holidays or potentially even extend your current facility to you. Again they might be getting some help here, so maybe they can pass this over to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Contact Black and White Accounting</strong></h2>\n<p>These are unprecedented times.

If approached in the right way, it can result in increased productivity and well-being. But, the convenience of remote work can present some personal and professional challenges.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Due to the recent <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\">Coronavirus</a> outbreak, many employers and businesses have opted for remote work culture to remain operational. This means that there are a lot of people who are new to this concept and unsure of the best approach to take. To ensure that you are on the track whilst at home, we&#8217;ve provided 5 top <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/work-from-home-with-kids-pets/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"207\">tips to ensure successful remote working</a>.</p>\n<p>This could be an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"193\">opportunity to test out contingency planning</a>, remote working and other ways of working, so we encourage you to embrace it and see if it can work for you.</p>\n<h2><strong>#1 &#8211; Set up a dedicated workspace</strong></h2>\n<p>The first key to effective remote working is your working environment. With your bed and sofa metres away, the temptation to work from these places is strong. But, actually, working from these spaces is risky. If you choose to work from places of relaxation, you may start to associate them with work itself. It is important that you have defined areas in your home for work and leisure, if possible. You do not want to sit on the sofa during your downtime, thinking about tomorrow&#8217;s deadline. Create a designated workspace and make sure your setup is comfortable.</p>\n<p>Health and safety precautions made in an office can also fall by the wayside when remote working. Activate the blue light filter on your screen and adjust your chair into an upright position. If your chair is not adjustable, place cushions behind you for support to ensure <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/common-posture-mistakes-and-fixes/\">good posture</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>#2 &#8211; Create a morning routine<br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p>Before starting the working day, it is important to be awake and ready to seize the day. Don&#8217;t rush around before your start time. Ease yourself into the morning with a cup of coffee, gentle exercise or reading a few pages of a book, or whatever gets you to the right headspace.</p>\n<p>Another thing which should be a part of your morning routine is getting dressed, brushing your teeth and hair and of course washing your hands etc. By staying in your pyjamas, you are not getting yourself into the working frame of mind. One of the main challenges when working from home is setting boundaries. Don&#8217;t treat your working day as a day off. You wouldn&#8217;t walk into an office in your nightwear, so why work from home in it?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that routine throughout the rest of the day isn&#8217;t important, but the morning especially sets the tone for the rest of the day.</p>\n<h2><strong>#3 &#8211; Maintain work/life balance</strong></h2>\n<p>There are a variety of things which you can do to ensure that you maintain a healthy work/life balance. And, they are all equally important!</p>\n<p>It is easy to fall into a trap of overworking when you have no-one else around you, or conversely getting distracted and under-working. Ensure that you maintain regular hours of work, and when you are not working, switch off. Work time is work time. Leisure time is leisure time. Keep these separate. This is even more important when you are working from home.</p>\n<p>If there are others who share your space, such as your partner or children, it is crucial to set ground rules. If you are still working when they come back from work or school, you need to lay out exactly what they can and cannot do during that time.</p>\n<h2><strong>#4 &#8211; Make time for short and regular breaks</strong></h2>\n<p>When in the home environment, it is easy to lose track of time. Some tasks can also be quite long-winded or arduous. What better way to refresh your mind than regular short breaks?</p>\n<p>Maintaining productivity for a long period of time is tricky. So make sure you schedule short and regular breaks! Go and stretch your legs for 5 minutes, read your book or go and make yourself a snack or drink.</p>\n<p>For those keen to enhance productivity, try Francesco Cirillo&#8217;s Pomodoro Technique. Created in the late 1980s, this technique uses a 25 minute timer to create intermissions in your day. After a 25 minute period is complete, you can have a short brain break.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, a lot of the good practices which apply in the workplace also apply with home working. For example, you should rest your eyes for 15 minutes after two hours of continuous computer use. And ideally follow the 20:20:20 rule; take a 20-second break to view something 20 feet away every 20 minutes to allow your eyes a chance to refocus.</p>\n<h2><strong>#5 &#8211; Regularly communicate with others</strong></h2>\n<p>Even when a team is working in the same place, effective communication can prove to be difficult. So, when in a situation where you need to distance yourself from others, it is even more important than ever to touch base. And there are so many simple ways to do that even beyond emails!</p>\n<p>Google Hangouts, Zoom and Skype are ideal for face-to-face discussion from afar. For quick questions and casual chat, Slack and Microsoft Teams are good messaging platforms too. To keep in the loop and sane, a combination of instant messaging and conferencing is ideal.</p>\n<p>In a time of self isolation, it is also essential to communicate with friends and family. You could even utilise your breaks to check-in and see how they are.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>This is a difficult time for everyone and we must come together to get through this.

There is also no cap on the amount.</p>\n<p>We understand this will be available from April 2020, backdated to 1<sup>st</sup> March 2020 and it will be administered by HMRC (likely PAYE department).</p>\n<p>Although the timing of the availability of it is not ideal (and we hope it will be revised so you have it in advance of payday), this is a huge measure designed to help employer’s keep their teams in work by helping cashflow, so when we come out of the other side of this, we will be ready to kick on with our businesses. £2,500 is also above the median wage, so is quite generous. Being a grant, rather than a loan, it will also not be payable at a later date.</p>\n<h3><strong>VAT Deferment</strong></h3>\n<p>If you or your business is VAT registered, you will not pay any VAT until at least the end of June (and this could be extended) and again there is no cap. The payment can also be postponed until the end of the financial year (which we assume they mean 31 March 2021) and represents a £30bn injection into the economy.</p>\n<p>There isn’t much more clarity here about this, but we would assume that the payment holiday will be automatic, but you would have to apply to defer the payment to the end of the financial year to HMRC in the usual way. Don’t forget there is the special <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tax-helpline-to-support-businesses-affected-by-coronavirus-covid-19\">coronavirus helpline</a> from HMRC where they may be able to arrange other payment plans for you, even above and beyond the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc\">time to play arrangements</a>.</p>\n<p>Once we get clarity on the exact delivery here, we will of course let you know.</p>\n<p>Be careful here. Whilst this could be a welcome cashflow boost too, this is a deferral rather than a grant; the VAT will still need to be paid at some point. Don’t forget when you collect HMRC from your customers, you are effectively collecting it on behalf HMRC and it is not your money. Therefore if you do utilise these funds, make sure you can pay these later in the year/next year when they fall due.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Interruption Loan</strong></h3>\n<p>This has been further improved with the interest-free period on any lending increasing from six to twelve months, but perhaps most importantly the scheme has been accelerated to week commencing Monday 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2020 which is weeks earlier than planned. More information can be found <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you think you are eligible, we suggest you investigate this as soon as the criteria are confirmed, if this could be the lifeline you need right now. Like with the VAT deferral however, it is a loan and it will need paying back eventually. We would expect the system to be overwhelmed initially, but given the size of the lenders behind this, they should get up to speed soon.</p>\n<h3><strong>Self-Assessment Tax Return Payments and Employment Support Allowance</strong></h3>\n<p>For those of you who were due to pay your second <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self-Assessment Tax Return</a> payment on account on 31 July 2020, this will now be deferred to 31 January 2021. This is a great cashflow help, but the second payment on account, as things stand, will still be due.</p>\n<p>Self-employed will also now be entitled to the equivalent of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-pay/\">Statutory Sick Pay</a>, which is £94.25 per week, for up to 28 weeks, if you are too ill to work. This is through the ‘Employment and Support Allowance’, you can claim via <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-universal-credit\">Universal Credit</a>. This was previously less generous. Although this might help, the benefit here is very small.</p>\n<p>Navigating the complexities of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self-Assessment Tax Returns</a> can be challenging, but with the deferral to January 2021 and the availability of Employment and Support Allowance, there are financial reliefs. Consulting with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">knowledgeable self-assessment accountant</a> can provide valuable insights to optimize your tax strategy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other Benefits</strong></h3>\n<p>There will be an increase in standard Universal Credit by £20 a week (£1,000 per year), with the same rise for those still on the working <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/rd-tax-credit-your-route-through-the-coronavirus-crisis/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"240\">tax credit</a> scheme (to cost £7bn per year), in addition to support for those struggling to pay their rent via Universal Credit with £1bn further support here.</p>\n<p>We are not clear on the timings of when these will go live, but if you claim Universal Credit make sure all your information is up to date and you are applying for all the benefits you can especially at this time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Call to Action</strong></h2>\n<p>This is a difficult time for us all, but it is also an opportunity for us to come together and support one another.</p>\n<p>If you are cancelling work with tradespeople, electricians, bathroom fitters, plumbers, builders etc, if you can postpone rather than cancel, so these businesses can be assured of their pipeline, and if you can afford to give the business a deposit now, this would be incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>If you have had to cancel an appointment with a small business, be it a hairdresser, beauty therapist, restaurant etc maybe consider buying a gift voucher at the same time for when you can eventually go back.</p>\n<p>Although the Government is helping businesses in a variety of ways some of these smaller businesses, depending upon they are set up, may not be eligible for any significant government support, therefore if you can please help them, so they don’t have to take unnecessary risks, please do so.</p>\n<p>We are also finding a lot of the smaller shops can have better stock than the supermarkets. Please do everything you can to support your small and local businesses, especially at this time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Further Updates</strong></h2>\n<p>When further details come out on the above and other support which might be available to you, we will of course be in touch with you. As always, the devil is in the detail.</p>\n<p>Party politics aside, the measures to support are big and they are bold. We’d like to see them come quicker and we’d like to see more specific support for the self-employed, but the government does need to ensure the architecture is in place to support any measures that they provide before they go live (insofar as possible), which is partly the reason for the timings of the measures.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>This is a difficult time for everyone and we must come together to get through this. Our thoughts are with you, your family and your friends especially at this time.</p>\n<p>If there is anything we can do to help you at this difficult time, please do get in touch by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contacting Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a>, populate the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

Below are summarised the current measures to date which will help the self employed. We will keep this updated if and when anything changes.</p>\n<p>It may sound a little perverse, but I hope no one reads this blog. I hope within 6 hours all of this is superseded by a much bigger package of support for this critical group in the UK.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It is our understanding that more announcements here should be imminent (perhaps even later today). The clever thing about the measures announced to date is that they build on existing policies and infrastructures so can be delivered to a greater degree and more quickly. These are however more difficult for the self employed, which is why we suspect the slight delay here; last week Stephen Barclay said it would be &#8220;operationally&#8221; hard to protect self employed incomes. The problem is, this is exactly the group that need the support perhaps the most and the quickest, so we hope this is addressed very promptly.</p>\n<p>Even more pressing, in a world of self-isolation and social distancing, last week 47% of the self employed surveyed would feel obliged to work even if they had the virus.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who are the Self Employed? </strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor\">Self Employed</a> are those who work for themselves as a freelance or the owner of a business, rather than for an employer.</p>\n<p>It is not however quite as simple as you are an “employee” or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/self-employed-what-about-me-part-deux/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"46\">“self employed”</a>.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you own a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> and for tax purposes have a PAYE scheme on your company, you are technically both self employed and an employee; and</li>\n<li>Some people are working as employees by the day and in the ‘gig economy’ by night, sometimes in the hope that the latter may take over the former, if things go to plan. These people are also self employed and employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The Importance of the Self employed</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the Office of National Statistics 15% of all UK workers are now classed as self employed. In fact, the UK is currently home to over 5 million self employed workers, with figures continuing to rise as people finally remove the shackles of 9-to-5 working.</p>\n<p>Yes, they can benefit from a better work-life balance, flexibility in when and how they work, they can even be paid more and pay less tax. However, at times like these the negatives are much more apparent.</p>\n<h2><strong>Self employed support</strong></h2>\n<p>One thing is for sure, when you compare this to our blog on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/additional-coronavirus-support-announced-20-march-2020/\">SMEs</a>, the support here is a lot more sparse. As we mention above, we hope this changes and quickly.</p>\n<h3><strong>Self-Assessment Tax Return Payments </strong></h3>\n<p>In reference to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self-Assessment Tax Return Payments</a>, for those of you who were due to pay your second payment on account on 31 July 2020, this will now be deferred to 31 January 2021.

On Friday it was announced that there would be an increase in standard Universal Credit by £20 a week (£1,000 per year), with the same rise for those still on the working tax credit scheme (to cost £7bn per year), in addition to support for those struggling to pay their rent via Universal Credit with £1bn further support here.</p>\n<p>We are not clear on the timings of when these will go live, but if you claim Universal Credit make sure all your information is up to date and you are applying for all the benefits you can especially at this time. If you are not currently claiming it, consider it.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Interruption Loan</strong></h3>\n<p>There will be a special loan available for Small businesses who are hit by the Coronavirus, as a temporary Business Interruption Loan. This could also be available to the self employed, although we haven&#8217;t received the clarity on that yet, as the criteria have not been confirmed.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/\">British Business Bank</a> will deliver the loan scheme, which should be in place this week, to support you, subject to certain criteria, including the future viability of your business.</p>\n<p>Interest rates will be similar to current bank lending as the Government will guarantee 80% of the loan, without a charge to you on the loan (unlike the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (‘EFG’)).</p>\n<p>Whilst this could help you, especially at this time and the interest-free period is now twelve rather than six months, ultimately this is a loan and it will still need to be repaid, it’s not the simplest and it’s not been launched yet so it is unclear how helpful this might be.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tax Helpline</strong></h3>\n<p>HMRC have set up a specialised <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tax-helpline-to-support-businesses-affected-by-coronavirus-covid-19\">helpline</a> and employed 2,000 specialised staff to help support businesses and the self employed concerned they will not be able to pay their tax on time, specifically due to the coronavirus. In additional to practical help and support, if you are unable to pay your tax as it falls due, they can explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>agreeing an instalment arrangements;</li>\n<li>suspending debt collection proceedings; and/or</li>\n<li>cancelling penalties and interest where you have administrative difficulties contacting or paying HMRC immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their scope is therefore above and beyond what can be provided as part of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-how-to-pay-a-debt-to-hmrc-with-a-time-to-pay-arrangement\">time to pay</a> agreement, so if you need to, we suggest you get in touch with them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Their opening hours are Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm, and Saturday 8am to 4pm, and they are often less busy first thing and last thing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other Potential Methods of Support</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VAT relief</strong> &#8211; if you or your business is VAT registered, you will not pay any VAT until at least the end of June (and this could be extended) and again there is no cap. The payment can also be postponed until the end of the financial year (which we assume they mean 31 March 2021). However most self employed are not VAT-registered so this wouldn’t help you. It is also only a deferral so will still need to be paid back at a later date.</li>\n<li><strong>Rates Relief</strong> – Small businesses can claim £10,000 cash grant (previously £3,000 in the Budget) with more specific relief in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors (and more specific sector support expected to follow later in the year). However, a lot of self employed do not have offices, or business premises, so this wouldn’t help them.</li>\n<li><strong>PAYE support </strong>– The government is offering a grant which will pay 80% of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/payslip-calculator/\">wages for employees</a> who would be laid off, if employees keep them on in the meantime, up to £2,500 per month. However, most self employed businesses often do not employ staff. Even if you are a limited company and you and your partner are on PAYE, we understand currently that this is unlikely to be available, at least at this point. This is therefore likely to be of little help here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Other Tips</strong></h2>\n<p>At this difficult time we all need to come together to support and help one another. Other than the above schemes, there are also a few things you might be able to do to help your business, above and beyond the government schemes mentioned above. These can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act now, plan, prepare and be ready, whatever the scenario;</li>\n<li>Prepare cashflow models for your business, to understand how your position is looking and when your issues will arise under different scenarios;</li>\n<li>Go through your profit and loss account; are there any costs you can strip out? Today, next week, next month? Do you need to set the ball-rolling now, especially as some services require a notice period?;</li>\n<li>If you have a landlord (for business or personal) talk to them and see if there is any flexibility in your current arrangement. They are potentially getting relief, maybe they can pass this along to you to keep you as a tenant?;</li>\n<li>Manage your debtors and creditors. Don’t pay anyone before you need to and get money in from your customers as quickly as you can. Maybe look to see if you can extend credit terms, payment days or put things on direct debit to spread payments and ultimately improve your working capital;</li>\n<li>If you have any lenders, keep communicating. If you are going to have any issues with payment, the earlier you communicate the better. However, you never know, they may be able to accept delay payments, payment holidays or potentially even extend your current facility to you. Again, they might be getting some help here, so maybe they can pass this over to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Black and White Accounting</strong></h2>\n<p>This is a difficult time for everyone and we must come together to get through this.

      "content": "<p>In case you missed it amongst all the other headlines, on Tuesday, 17 March the government announced its last-minute decision to postpone the implementation of the Off-Payroll changes, or IR35, that were due to be introduced on the 6 April 2020. The delay is to help businesses and individuals who may be struggling following the impact of Covid-19, but what should you do now? Will this help you, or is it simply too little, too late?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It is the most recent in a string of delays to proposed <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">changes in Government policy, following the footsteps of Making Tax Digital (‘MTD’) roll out, Changes to VAT</a> in the Construction Sector and of course Brexit itself, and it probably won’t be the last with the focus of Government shifting from Brexit to the Coronavirus.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is IR35?</strong></h2>\n<p>IR35, or Intermediaries Legislation, is used to describe the tax legislation designed to combat the tax avoidance by contractors/freelance workers and the firms that hire them, typically via an intermediary such as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> (sometimes called a ‘Personal Service Company’), who would be employees and pay tax via PAYE, were it not for the intermediary. These ‘deemed employees’ have to pay Income Tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a>, as if they were employees, if HMRC deem them to be within the legislation, which would have a significant impact on their incomes.</p>\n<p>Whilst the legislation has been in place since April 2000, it is regarded as poorly conceived and badly implemented by HMRC, which causes unnecessary costs and hardships for other genuine businesses. The government therefore tried to refresh the legislation for the Public Sector in 2017 and this was proposed to be extended to Medium and Large firms in the private sector from April 2020, before it was delayed.</p>\n<p>The private sector reform would have seen a shifting of responsibility for determining the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax status of the contractor from the service</a> provider to the client business. If a contractor was considered a “deemed employee” the client business would then be responsible for processing payments through their payroll making all necessary tax and NI deductions rather than the contractor doing this themselves, unless of course they chose to operate through an Umbrella company.</p>\n<p>Confusingly IR35 is used to refer to all this legislation, past, present and future.</p>\n<h2><strong>When will IR35 take effect?</strong></h2>\n<p>The rollout of this legislation to the private sector has been a contentious issue, met with much opposition from many sections of industry who were impacted. They feared that contractors would withdraw their services rather than be considered a ‘deemed employee’ and taxed through the client’s payroll or through an umbrella company as this would result in an effective 25% reduction in their pay. In some sectors the contractors can increase their rates by the same amount, so the net effect is neutralised, but this is unlikely to be an option for most, especially in competitive industries.</p>\n<p>The postponement of the rollout of the IR35 changes to the 6 April 2021 will no doubt be welcomed as it’s surely hoped that this allows more time for a review of how the legislation is to be implemented, including how assessments for determining a contractor status is done.</p>\n<p>It’s also widely being argued that the governments CEST tool, designed to help businesses and contractors assess their status, is not comprehensive enough to do a fair assessment. Whilst the latest release is an improvement on the first draft, it still does not cover all the fundamentals which HMRC use to make an assessment.</p>\n<h2><strong>Too little, too late?</strong></h2>\n<p>Whilst we welcome the delay as it will give us all time to re-assess the situation and work out what is best for our clients, if this had been changed six or nine months ago, this would be the headline winner. However, to put it simply this is too little too late for many contractors who have already lost their roles, been forced into PAYE positions and often otherwise being hounded by HMRC.</p>\n<p>Even before the legislation came live, we saw massive changes in recruitment here, with several large companies including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and GlaxoSmithKline telling sub-contractors to go on payroll or leave. Research suggested that half of the contractors planned to leave clients in the last eight weeks up to the legislation coming live, effectively costing the UK economy £2.2bn, but even with only a few weeks to go, 28% of contractors were still waiting to find out their status which has caused great uncertainty.</p>\n<h2><strong>What should you do now IR35 is postponed?</strong></h2>\n<p>While the postponement of IR35 means you won’t need to press the “GO” button on 6 April this year, it is worth ensuring you continue to keep appraised of IR35, especially for those businesses which were on “catch up” to be ready for the changes this year. In order to be ready for next year we recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping up to date of any proposed changes to IR35 over the coming year to ensure you can adapt accordingly;</li>\n<li>Continue assessing your contractor engagements to see if they come within the scope for IR35;</li>\n<li>Reviewing your payroll software, ensuring it can process “off payroll” employees; and</li>\n<li>Talking to your contractors to ensure they are aware of the delay, as it may impact their ongoing service provisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IR35 may not be happening this year but April 2021 will arrive quicker than we expect and the Government appears determined for it to still take place, this is simply a deferral. Use the time wisely to seek advice and get ahead of the game and avoid a last-minute panic in a year’s time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Need IR35 advice?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you would like to discuss IR35 or any other business challenge you’re concerned about and how it may impact you, our specialist team of business advisers is ready to help; <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, complete the ‘Got a Question’ form on the right hand side, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

Family, friends and our community come first, but the reality is we still have our livelihoods to consider.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>You might have more time now (even if it’s when the kids are in bed or napping) without the daily commute and it is critical to use this time to get ahead of your competitors and re-evaluate your position. Focusing on some key activities can help keep you on top of your work but also how you plan for the future. Here are our thoughts about how you can first ensure your business survives, before changing gear to ensure that it thrives going forward.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key tasks to consider</strong></h2>\n<p>Each person’s business and individual circumstances are unique and so you will need to take time to reflect on your own situation but as an indicator of some key activities to consider, beyond the ‘Day Job’. We suggest:</p>\n<h3>Paths to business survival</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote working</strong>: If you have to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/5-top-tips-for-effective-remote-working-from-self-care-to-maintaining-productivity/\">work from home</a> establish and stick to a routine that will help you to adjust, so any drop in productivity is minimised.</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding the support available:</strong> The Government has announced a range of emergency measures to help individuals and businesses through the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Take time to understand them and know which are applicable to you. We have written several blogs here, on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/self-employed-what-about-me/\">Self-Employed</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/additional-coronavirus-support-announced-20-march-2020/\">Additional Support</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2020-and-beyond-whats-in-it-for-me-and-my-sme/\">Help for SMEs</a> and the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/2020-budget/\">2020 Budget</a> and will continue to keep you updated via our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/news/\">Blogs</a> and across Social Media (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blackandwhiteacc/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bandwaccountants/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/black-&amp;-white-chartered-certified-accountants/\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BandWAccounting\">Twitter</a>). The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19\">Government Guidance</a> is also constantly being updated. If they are unclear get in touch with us.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial forecasting:</strong> even if you have a strong business, it could get swept away at times like these due to running out of cash. Do daily, weekly and monthly forecasts based on your latest information (including the support available above) under different scenarios to understand your bite points where tough decisions might need to be made. Update these regularly so you are ready for anything; there may be actions you are not prepared to take now but might need to consider in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Working Capital Management: </strong>With the above in mind, ensure your consumers pay you on time and look to increase your credit limit and payment terms with existing suppliers and don’t pay them before you need to, in order to improve your cashflow position. Particularly if you have any rental payments, as your landlord may be getting support, maybe they can pass this onto you? Consider your personal position too; can the banks or landlord provide you with a payment holiday?</li>\n<li><strong>Good housekeeping:</strong> In addition to the above take the opportunity to:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cut costs:</strong> although you are unlikely to be able to change your fixed costs such as premises and employees in the short-term, cut any unnecessary expenses, especially if they are costs your consumers do not see, or delay things to improve your cashflow position.</li>\n<li><strong>Financials: </strong>make sure your numbers are up to date so you are able to make the best decisions you can based on the latest available information. Some of the support available will also require up to date financials so you are likely to need to do this in any case.</li>\n<li><strong>Check insurance policies:</strong> Understand what you are and are not covered for. For example, to do you have key man insurance if illness strikes? What about critical illness cover, or income protection?;</li>\n<li><strong>Keep communication:</strong> Even though we may feel isolated, we aren’t. Look for different ways to stay connected with clients, partners, suppliers, advisors etc, especially if you need their support.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Path to thrive</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strategy, Strategy, Strategy:</strong> What do you want to be famous for? What’s your three year and five-year plan? What’s your Strategy, Vision and Values? What does your consumer journey look like and how can it be optimised? What are your Unique Selling Points (&#8216;USPs&#8217;)? What is the culture you want embedded in your organisation currently and how can it be done? Does your Business Plan reflect all this? What does success look like to you?</li>\n<li><strong>Sell, Sell, Sell:</strong> If you want to grow, what is your path to growth? What does your target consumer look like? How do you currently gain the best referrals and how can you gain more of these? If you have a different business strategy to growth, similarly how do you achieve this more quickly? Make sure your sales and marketing plan supports your Strategy. Maybe you don’t need to sell more to more consumers; maybe you could increase your prices, cross-sell, or premiumise (AKA upsell) the services you provide to your existing consumers?</li>\n<li><strong>Supply chain strategy </strong>– rather than making the most with your existing suppliers, as noted above, why not go to market and see if there are better suppliers out there to help you satisfy your consumers? These could be quicker, higher quality, cheaper or more reliable to name but a few improvements which your consumer will see so are likely to be value for money changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Cut costs</strong> – You’ve got the right plan in place now. What resource do you need to support it? How can you meet the consumer need but ensure you are getting value for money with both your fixed and variable costs? What costs are unnecessary as they are unseen by your consumer? This goes beyond the supply chain point above.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>If in doubt, seek advice</strong></h2>\n<p>As the situation evolves around COVID-19 we expect to see regular announcements with news and initiatives that may or may not affect our businesses and personal situations.

Party politics aside, please remember the help for the self employed is much harder to administer and deliver because unlike the other support announced to date, it doesn&#8217;t build on an existing infrastructure in the same way. To be frank it also doesn&#8217;t help everyone and is only coming in June, so it is far from ideal.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It is however a start, a step in the right direction and there maybe more measures to come or tweaking of current measures. The below is the best information we have at this point. We will of course keep you updated with any such changes here. This is also an update on our earlier blog,  <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/self-employed-what-about-me/\">Self Employed: What about me?</a></p>\n<h2>Income support if self employed</h2>\n<p>A new Income Support Scheme will be set up for those affected by the Coronavirus, providing a taxable grant worth 80% of the self employed&#8217;s average monthly taxable profits over the last three years, up to £2,500 per month for up to three months, so it is now in line with the Job Retention Scheme to help employees. It will be available for at least three months and could be extended if needed. However, if you don&#8217;t have three years records, we understand the Government will consider anything you have.</p>\n<p>Government guidance is constantly being updated and can be found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Claiming income support for self employed</h2>\n<p>The Chancellor believes that this will be available for 95% of the Self Employed and will be available from early June (as three months lump-sum), if not before.</p>\n<p>This will be available for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those with trading profits worth up to £50,000;</li>\n<li>Where the majority of income is from self-employment;</li>\n<li>Only those already in self-employment who have <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> for 2018/19;</li>\n<li>If you failed to submit your 2018/19 tax return on-time you have four weeks to correct this; and</li>\n<li>Will be provided even if you are still able to work, unlike the employee scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you or anyone you know need help with submitting your 2018/19 tax return, we would be delighted to help you here.</p>\n<h2>How do I apply for income support?</h2>\n<p>HMRC will contact eligible individuals directly, so keep an eye out for this. They will ask you to populate an online form and they will then transfer any payments directly into your bank account.</p>\n<p>Whilst we haven&#8217;t seen the online form ourselves yet, we will look to support and help you with this, if we are able to and it is of interest to you.</p>\n<h2>Can I claim income support as a company director?</h2>\n<p>Essentially the Government have taken the legal definition of self employed here and considered Directors of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited companies</a>, many of whom are also employees of the limited company, for tax reasons, as employees and not self employed.</p>\n<p>Based on the eligibility criteria here, it appears clear that Directors of Limited companies will not be covered by this. It appears the Government is looking for them to put themselves on furlough then claim through the Job Retention Scheme. As many are on very low salaries here, 80% of this will be of little benefit to them, so we are hoping the Government revise their position here.</p>\n<p>The idea that a Director by their very nature can be on furlough, due to the very nature of their responsibilities is at best odd, but we understand that the Government want as many individuals covered as possible through the furloughing, so are more flexible in their thinking here. For example, if you have let someone go already, they would be open to you retaining them and claiming the payment through furlough, as this is a vehicle to help people and there would be nothing wrong with doing this, indeed they might even encourage it.</p>\n<h2>Other entitlements to consider</h2>\n<p>There are other existing measures which can help you here, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rates relief and Grants &#8211; which is supposed to be live now, although we haven&#8217;t see any cheques yet;</li>\n<li>Business Interruption Loan &#8211; apparently there have been 30,000 enquiries already, but even getting through to the Banks currently is proving difficult;</li>\n<li>Second Payment on Account &#8211; due to be paid 31 July 2020 is deferred to 31 January 2021;</li>\n<li>Universal Credit &#8211; enhanced for the self employed, as is Housing Benefit. However, on Wednesday the Department for Work &amp; Pensions (DWP) confirmed that they had taken 477,000 applications in the first nine days, so there is a bit of a wait here. They are however, reallocating staff to process these applications quicker and advances are offered to applicants (but don&#8217;t forget these will need to be paid back).</li>\n<li>Coronavirus Tax <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tax-helpline-to-support-businesses-affected-by-coronavirus-covid-19\">Helpline </a>&#8211; so they can arrange payment plans even beyond what the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-how-to-pay-a-debt-to-hmrc-with-a-time-to-pay-arrangement\">time to pay</a> agreement might offer.</li>\n<li>VAT Deferral &#8211; if you are VAT registered.</li>\n<li>PAYE Relief &#8211; if you have employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Additional tips</strong></h2>\n<p>At this difficult time we all need to come together to support and help one another.

It is not clear on the mechanism for doing this however and we recommend you speak to your local rates office to find out more, although it should become clear in the next two to four weeks. One such office said that this should be an automatic process, which wouldn’t require an application, but we await confirmation if this is indeed the case.</p>\n<p>There is more specific relief in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors here and more to come.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Interruption Loan</strong></h3>\n<p>There will be a special loan available for small companies who are hit by the Coronavirus, as a temporary Business Interruption Loan.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/\">British Business Bank</a> will deliver the loan scheme, which “will be in place in a matter of weeks” to support SMEs to access bank lending and overdrafts. Interest rates will be similar to current bank lending as the Government will forgo their 2% premium which they charge on the similar Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (‘EFG’).</p>\n<p>Essentially, the Government will provide the lenders with an 80% guarantee of the loan, with the lending provided by a pool of lenders, supporting loans of up to £1.2m per small business (with anticipated total lending here to hit £1.2bn). We believe this is going to be extended as part of the £330bn package, but details have not been released yet. There also might be specific help available here for the aviation industry.</p>\n<p>However, ultimately this is a loan and it will still need to be repaid, it’s not the simplest and it’s not been launched yet so it is unclear how helpful this might be.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tax Helpline</strong></h3>\n<p>HMRC have set up a specialised <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helpline </a>and employed 2,000 specialised staff to help support businesses and the self-employed concerned they will not be able to pay their tax on time, specifically due to the coronavirus. In additional to practical help and support, if you are unable to pay your tax as it falls due, they can explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>agreeing an installment arrangements;</li>\n<li>suspending debt collection proceedings; and/or</li>\n<li>cancelling penalties and interest where you have <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-administrative-and-pa-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">administrative difficulties</a> contacting or paying HMRC immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their scope is therefore above and beyond what can be provided as part of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-how-to-pay-a-debt-to-hmrc-with-a-time-to-pay-arrangement\">time to pay agreement</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">,</a> so if you need to, we suggest you get in touch with them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Their opening hours are Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm, and Saturday 8am to 4pm, and they are often less busy first thing and last thing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other Tips</strong></h3>\n<p>At this difficult time, we all need to come together to support and help one another.

      "content": "<p>In just a few days, two big changes are coming to Capital Gains Tax (&#8216;CGT&#8217;), which will raise additional tax when individuals dispose of residential properties and HMRC will collect the tax significantly more quickly from the taxpayer. As these changes are in legislation already, only more legislation could reverse this, so even with coronavirus at large, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any abating these changes (although we&#8217;d love to be wrong here) and indeed once we come out the other side of this, the increased revenue will be in even more need than before.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Payment for CGT is currently 10 to 22 months after the chargeable event, reducing this to 30 days will likely bring a one-off additional yield of £5-8bn of tax revenue. In addition to this the reduction of the final period of ownership for private residence relief and essentially abolishing letting relief are all discussed further below.</p>\n<h2>About Capital Gains Tax</h2>\n<p>CGT was first introduced in 1965 on gains made on the disposal of assets by individuals, personal representatives and trustees. In 2018/19 this tax alone raised £9.2bn in revenues for HMRC, which was the highest annual amount since 2005/06 and approximately 1.5% of total annual tax revenue. An annual increase of 18.6%, the growth has been driven by increasing property prices over the last two decades, more landlords selling their buy-to-lets due to the changes in property taxes, shareholders cashing in long-term gains during a benign stock market and foreign investors purchasing UK assets and businesses following sterling weakness after the 2016 EU Referendum.</p>\n<h2>Capital Gains Tax on residential property</h2>\n<p>If you, as an individual or partnership, sell a property in the UK, you may need to pay CGT on any profits made, subject to certain exemptions, including the property being your main home (&#8216;Principal Residence Relief&#8217;). This is commonly the case for example, when you sell a second home, or buy-to-let property.</p>\n<p>The capital gain is the difference between the disposal proceeds and the cost of acquiring the property and improving it, which is then taxed at the relevant tax rate after any annual exemption (£12,000 in 2019/20 per individual, but see our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Ftax-rates-and-allowances%2Fcapital-gains-tax\">rates</a> page for more details). Individuals pay CGT on residential properties at 18% or 28% depending on whether they are standard or higher rate tax payers, factoring in any <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">capital gains will be included when working out your tax</a> status for the year, and may push you into a higher bracket. With other assets, the basic-rate of CGT is 10%, and the higher-rate is 20%.</p>\n<h3>Earlier payment of CGT on residential property</h3>\n<p>This change, originating from George Osborne, but whose implementation was initially delayed, essentially strips out the initial computation of any gain from the self-assessment system and makes it a standalone report and payment, although self-assessment taxpayers will continue to also report the gain on their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>, for all residential property sales after 6th April 2020. The result is any tax on the gain will need to be paid within 30 days of the transaction, rather than in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax return</a> of the individual who owns the property, which would be 10 to 22 months after the chargeable event, or completion date. Following this change initiated by George Osborne, property owners now face a separate report and payment for gains within 30 days of the transaction, necessitating a nuanced approach that a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment accountant</a> can help navigate effectively.</p>\n<h3>Returns, Amendments, Enquiries and Payment</h3>\n<p>A return must be filed within 30 days of the date of disposal, including a declaration by the person making it that the return is to the best of the person’s knowledge correct and complete. However, this return is not required for &#8216;no gain-no loss&#8217; disposals, nor for disposals where no tax is due. Available capital losses can be utilised to reduce any tax due, subject to the usual rules.</p>\n<p>Where there is more than one disposal in a year, the tax is calculated after each disposal, factoring in the previous disposals in the year, so the cumulative amount of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">Capital Gains Tax is calculated</a> each time a disposal is made, with the net tax due (overpaid) is due for payment (refund).</p>\n<p>The usual 12 month period for amending returns remains, but they can only be amended in respect of events that have already occurred at the date the return was delivered.</p>\n<p>The usual enquiry windows will also apply and if a self-assessment tax return is enquired into, it is deemed that any gains shown within that return will also be deemed under enquiry.</p>\n<p>The payment is also calculated and due to be paid within 30 days of the date of disposal. The amount paid is referred to as a payment on account of the CGT for that year, as it is effectively an interim payment of Capital Gains Tax with the final calculation of the total CGT liability being performed, as usual, through the self assessment system, at least for now.</p>\n<h2>CGT on Principal Residence Relief</h2>\n<p>Generally, you won&#8217;t pay Capital Gains Tax when selling the property you live in, due to the &#8216;Principal Residence Relief&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Provided the property genuinely has been your main home at some point, you won&#8217;t need to pay capital gains tax for the time it was your main residence, plus the past 18 months of ownership (even if you weren&#8217;t living in the property during those 18 months). People with a disability or those who move into a care home can claim for up to the past 36 months of ownership.</p>\n<p>Examples of when you might still get a CGT bill include when you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert part of it into flats;</li>\n<li>When you use part of your home exclusively for business;</li>\n<li>Bought a home for the purpose of doing it up and selling it on;</li>\n<li>Let out all or part of your home (excluding having a single lodger when you live in the property aswell);</li>\n<li>Sell part of the garden or your total plot, if the area you&#8217;re selling, is more than half a hectare (1.2 acres); and/or</li>\n<li>Where you moved out of the property 18 months or more ago (soon to be 9 months, as below), for example to move into a partner’s home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to Principal Residence Relief</h3>\n<p>From 6th April 2020, private residence relief will apply to the time you lived in the home, plus the final 9 months of ownership &#8211; instead of the final 18 months. However, people who move into a care home, or have a disability will still be able to claim for the last 36 months of ownership. People will still be able to claim private residents relief for any period where the property was their main home.</p>\n<h2>Rental Relief on Capital Gains Tax</h2>\n<p>If you have let out part or all of your home, a proportion of any gain when you sell it could be taxable. But if you used to live in the property, you may be able to claim letting relief, which will reduce your capital gains tax bill. Letting relief doesn&#8217;t apply to buy-to-let investors who let out their properties and never live in them.</p>\n<p>Currently, the amount of letting relief you can claim will be the lowest of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The gain you receive from the letting proportion of the home;</li>\n<li>The amount of private residence relief you can claim; or</li>\n<li>£40,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note you cannot claim private residence relief and letting relief for the same period. This means if you are letting the property out when you come to sell, the past 18 months of ownership (soon to be 9 months) qualify for private residence relief rather than letting relief. The exact amount of private residence relief and letting relief you can get depends on the amount you sell the property for.</p>\n<h3>Letting Relief &#8216;Abolition&#8217;</h3>\n<p>From 6th April 2020, rental relief is being scaled back so it is only available for people who were in shared occupancy with a tenant. Anyone who has lived in a property and now rents it out is likely to be hit by this change and, as a result, could face a larger capital gains tax bill.</p>\n<h2>Potential Issues with the changes</h2>\n<p>Several potential issues come to mind resulting from these changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing which <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">tax rate</a> to use, i.e., 18% or 28% can be difficult, especially if you have varying levels of income each year, for example if you are self-employed. Whilst the self-assessment tax return will &#8220;true-up&#8221; the tax to ensure the right amount is paid, there will be big interest and penalties for those who underpay their tax here. This is likely to lead to individuals overpaying and reclaiming in their next tax return, if they can afford to do so, from a cashflow perspective. Indeed, some individuals who previously didn’t submit a tax return may now look to do so, to ensure they do not overpay their tax.</li>\n<li>The changes have not been widely reported, so may not be widely known. The government seems to have a preference for leaving it to the Accountants to spread the bad news. Hence why we are writing this blog to raise awareness. If as we suspect, this is the case, it could result in filings and payments not being made in time, accruing interest and penalties and potential special attention from HMRC. Please spread the word to anyone who this might apply to. It&#8217;s a shame there isn&#8217;t a &#8216;soft landing&#8217; process for the introduction of this change, like other <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/potential-changes-to-the-uk-tax-regime-in-the-upcoming-budget/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"122\">changes in the tax regime</a> recently.</li>\n<li>More complexity, means potentially more incorrect filings and penalties for individuals, who do not get the right support.</li>\n<li>Even if the you are aware of the changes, it will still be a challenge to get all the right information required to compute the gain within the timescale. HMRC authorisation and details of the process are still, at this stage, unknown.</li>\n<li>There could be additional tax from the sale of a main residence (partial rather than full relief), which will also interact with the CGT calculations, further complicating the calculations, especially with the tight timelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Update 16th April 2020</h2>\n<p>HMRC has confirmed it will not charge penalties for the late reporting of capital gains tax (CGT) on disposals of UK residential property by UK residents up to and including 31 July 2020. However, interest will continue to accrue if the tax remains unpaid after 30 days. This means transactions completed between 6 April and 30 June 2020 and reported up to 31 July 2020. Transactions completed from 1 July 2020 onwards will receive a late filing penalty if they are not reported within 30 calendar days, as outlined above.</p>\n<p>This grace period has been provided to give those selling properties time to familiarise themselves with the change in rules and online process.</p>\n<h2><strong>Black and White Accounting</strong></h2>\n<p>CGT is unfortunately not an easy tax to get your head around. If you might have a tax liability from a capital gain, we really encourage you to talk to an adviser, be that us or someone else, to ensure you pay the right amount of tax, on time, and can move onto more important things in your life.</p>\n<p>If there is anything we can do to help with Capital Gains Tax or anything else, please do get in touch by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contacting Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a>, populate the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Yesterday it was announced that HMRC are to postpone the requirement for VAT registered businesses to digitally link their VAT return processes, from data source to VAT return until 1 April 2021, due to the Coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Making Tax Digital (‘MTD’) is an HMRC initiative attempting to transform the UK tax system, with more regular and detailed submissions of information and payments of tax to HMRC electronically.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Whilst it has been delayed several times, it aims to make tax administration more effective, efficient, and easier for taxpayers through implementing a digital tax system by 2020, whilst also reducing HMRC’s overheads for managing tax affairs.</p>\n<p>The first wave is underway, with VAT registered businesses, with a turnover over £85,000 (‘the threshold’) undergoing the change. Put simply, these businesses need to be submitting their VAT returns either through compliant software, such as Xero, Quick Books, Sage or a bridging software. If the business is VAT registered but turnover is beneath the limit, they can opt-out of MTD.</p>\n<h1>Digital Tax *Delayed*</h1>\n<p>The next phase of the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mtd-2022-update/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"132\">Making Tax Digital</a> requirements was to be the &#8216;Digital Journey&#8217;, so as to remove any manual intervention taking place in the data prior to submission. This was due to be implemented between 1 April 2020 and 1 October 2020. However, this has now been delayed until 1 April 2021. What this means is that businesses covered here have until their first VAT return period starting on or after 1 April 2021 to put digital links in place.</p>\n<p>HMRC acknowledged that not all businesses would have the time or resources to get MTD compliant immediately. As a result they allowed a &#8216;soft landing&#8217; period, where penalties were not issued for non-compliance for the first year. This essentially increases the length of the soft landing period for these businesses, which is sensible in the current climate.</p>\n<p>Whilst we welcome this delay as it gives businesses more time to adjust to these new requirements, at this stage, it is only a postponement and given the current climate, this will come round very quickly, so doesn&#8217;t give you much breathing space.</p>\n<h1>Steps to Digital Tax Compliance</h1>\n<p>Are you Making Tax Digital compliant? If not, we recommend that you get onto a compliant <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-software-implementation-training-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">software</a> at your earliest convenience. For example, we work most with Xero, QuickBooks and Sage, but also use FreeAgent and Wave, to name but a few. The easiest time to switch is at the beginning of a new accounting period, or the start of a new VAT quarter.</p>\n<p>Aside from the requirement to use such software, there are also a lot of potential benefits from using it, which we highlight in this <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-apps-bookkeeping-software-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">blog</a>. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less chance of human error as less manual entry;</li>\n<li>Much more time efficient, especially with bank feeds;</li>\n<li>Business Reports to enable you to make sound business decisions based on better information (rather than data);</li>\n<li>Automation of processes so for example you know at the click of a button who owes you what; and</li>\n<li>The information you need 24/7 365 days a year, all you need is an internet connection if it is cloud-based.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Making Tax Digital (&#8216;MDT&#8217;) Next Steps</h1>\n<p>MTD continues to create opportunities and cause problems for VAT-registered businesses whose threshold exceeds £85,000. It is a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’ this will be rolled out on other taxes. The next three groups likely to be impacted will be:<br />\n• VAT-registered businesses with turnover less than £85,000;<br />\n• <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax; or</a><br />\n• <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">Income Tax</a>.</p>\n<p>However, as none of these have been consulted on yet, it is likely they will not take place before 2021 at the earliest.

Is this keeping you awake at night? If so, a disclosure under the Let Property Campaign (&#8216;LPC&#8217;) could be the answer.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In a world where HMRC have access to more and better data more quickly and Letting Agents have more obligations to ensure landlords are correctly reporting their affairs, we recommend you report any undeclared income and you do so as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>HMRC Let Property Campaign</h1>\n<p>The first £1,000 of income you receive from <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/property-and-trade-allowances/\">property rental is tax-free, using the &#8216;Property Allowance&#8217;</a>. If you are letting out a room in your house which is furnished, you can earn up to £7,500 before paying tax under the &#8216;Rent-a-Room Scheme&#8217;. However, if you earned more than this and it isn&#8217;t a furnished room in your house, then you need to declare your income to HMRC.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self-Assessment Tax Return must be filed</a> where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£2,500 to £9,999 after allowable expenses; or</li>\n<li>£10,000 or more before allowable expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not usually <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">send tax returns</a>, you need to register by 5 October following the tax year you had rental income.</p>\n<p>However, if you haven&#8217;t done this and you have received income from letting out residential property/(ies) historically Let Property Campaign could be the way to get your tax affairs up to date quickly and as painlessly as possible.</p>\n<p>The LPC is not just about putting an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">individual&#8217;s tax affairs</a> right regarding rental income. There must be rental income as part of any disclosure, but the application must also declare any other undisclosed income. Unlike most historic HMRC campaigns, the Let Property Campaign doesn&#8217;t have an end date.</p>\n<h1>How does it work?</h1>\n<p>The first step is to notify HMRC (either you directly, or via your adviser) that you want to declare your undeclared property income. HMRC will reply, including a reference number and giving you three months to make a disclosure. This is an unprompted disclosure, as you have volunteered to declare this income to HMRC and this is the best position to be in. If you want a tax adviser to support you during this process, we will need to get authorised with HMRC to act as your agent.</p>\n<p>However, HMRC have access to information that can allow them to ask landlords who have received property income, which they haven&#8217;t declared to make a disclosure. This is called a prompted disclosure. Here the interest and penalties will be higher as a result. For example, periodically HMRC can gain information from local authorities or letting agents (who HMRC can legally force to provide them with information) and use this to write to individuals to whom rent is paid who may not have declared this income to them.</p>\n<p>A three month period to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculate and declare the income</a> should be plenty of time, especially where you use a tax adviser to support you. However, if you need more time than this, HMRC will consider reasonable extensions, the key is to keep communicating.</p>\n<p>At the same time as the submission is made, you will have to make the tax payment to HMRC, including interest. HMRC can of course come back and ask you questions on what is disclosed, but from our experience this is unusual and disclosures are generally accepted.</p>\n<h1>More information about Let Property Campaign</h1>\n<p>HMRC only want to receive LPC disclosures where tax is due. Sometimes after the calculations have been done, due to the nature of residential property investment, there are only losses left. Where this is the case, a copy of the calculations should be provided to HMRC so they can be taken against future profits in your Self-Assessment Tax Return.</p>\n<p>An individual who makes a disclosure under Let Property Campaign should automatically be registered for Self-Assessment. However, from our experience this typically doesn&#8217;t happen, so you or your tax advisers may have to do this for you.</p>\n<p>LPC is the only route for people who have undeclared rental income to bring their affairs up to date and typically an individual should receive a more favourable penalty position, than if they made a disclosure by other routes, according to HMRC.</p>\n<h1>Why use the Let Property Campaign?</h1>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can bring all your tax affairs up to date with HMRC quickly and easily, not just undeclared property income;</li>\n<li>It is the only disclosure regime for people who have undeclared rental income to bring their affairs up to date;</li>\n<li>You are likely to pay less in interest, penalties and tax, especially if it is an unprompted disclosure;</li>\n<li>The process is quicker and easier, especially if you use a tax adviser to support your application;</li>\n<li>HMRC have access to better data more quickly, so are more likely to catch those who don&#8217;t declare all their income and the resulting interest, penalties and tax will be much higher as a result;</li>\n<li>Often because of the nature of residential property investment the tax isn&#8217;t necessarily very high, if indeed anything at all; and</li>\n<li>It means you can sleep at night with a clear conscience. How much is the price of your sanity?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Black and White Accounting</h1>\n<p>We have successfully dealt with many Let Property Campaign cases and we handle them quickly and easily, with minimal involvement from you, so you can focus on what&#8217;s more important to you. This isn&#8217;t the only tax investigation process we deal with, we deal with many different cases.

For many of them, it seems that no matter how often their good intentions promised that they would put money aside for it, the tax deadline is a period of real financial difficulty.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>To help spread the cost of your tax and lower the chance of a financially debilitating bill, HMRC devised <em>payment on account</em>, a way of paying your tax in advance to avoid difficulty. Of course, having to pay your due tax plus an additional amount for the following year doesn’t help as much as might have been intended.</p>\n<p>Those who make less than £1,000 profit in a year do not have to make tax payments on account, but once over this threshold, payment on account is mandatory for all individuals. This is one of our most often asked FAQs, so we thought we’d write a blog on it, to hopefully make it easier to understand.</p>\n<h2>What is payment on account?</h2>\n<p>It’s really not a complicated system. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-account\">Payment on account</a> happens twice throughout the year (at the end of January and the end of July) and each is a 50% payment of the previous years’ tax. The idea is that when the next self-assessment bill is due, a significant portion will already have been paid.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the payments on account for the following year will then be due, so it doesn’t really help the problem, and for self-employed people approaching their very first tax bill, it simply makes the bill 50% larger than they would like which is extremely painful especially when you are first setting up.</p>\n<p>Payment on account turns paying your bill once it is due, into paying a significant portion in advance each year.</p>\n<h2>An example of payment on account</h2>\n<p>Tom started his business in February 2017, part of the 16/17 tax year. By April 2017, he had only earned a few hundred pounds and any earnings from his previous employment had already been taxed under PAYE. His self-assessment in January 2018 was simple and there was no tax to pay.</p>\n<p>Business grew well, and in the 17/18 tax year, Tom’s profits (after expenses) totalled £34,000. Without any special <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-planning-and-structuring-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax planning</a>, Tom was expecting to pay income tax at the end of January 2019 of £4,300:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal allowance of £12,500 = £0</li>\n<li>20% of £22,500 = £4,300</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tom’s actual bill for January 31st, 2019 however, was £6,350:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£4,300 for tax year 2017/18</li>\n<li>£2,150 as 50% payment on account for tax year 2018/19</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tom also had to pay a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/july-2019-newsletter/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"211\">July 2019</a> payment on account of £2,150 for the other 50%.</p>\n<p>In the 2018/19 year, Tom’s profits grew to £52,000. His owed tax is calculated as £10,800:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal allowance of £12,500 = £0</li>\n<li>20% of £25,000 = £5,000</li>\n<li>40% of £14,500 = £5,800</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final payment due January 2020 would be calculated as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculated tax of £10,800</li>\n<li>Payment on account of 50% = £5,400</li>\n<li>Previous paid tax on account of £4,300</li>\n<li>Total tax bill: £11,900</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tom will also face a July 2020 tax on account payment of £5,400.</p>\n<h2>The pros and cons of tax on payment on account</h2>\n<p>It is hard to see the positives of having to pay tax in advance, and in truth, despite the government’s attempt to make payment on account a way to spread the hit of the tax bill, a simple (and properly managed) savings account would accomplish the same benefit and also be a lot more flexible.</p>\n<p>One could argue that if your activity is lower in the following year, resulting in less tax due, your payment on accounts will be reduced and in fact you could be due back some money from HMRC. However, if you were asked; would you prefer cash in your pocket today or the same amount in a years’ time you are likely to universally get the same answer, now!</p>\n<p>The truth is that paying tax in advance really is only good for HMRC themselves.</p>\n<h2>National Insurance (NI) on account</h2>\n<p>The example provided above shows the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">calculation for income tax</a> alone, however, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your self-assessment tax return</a> also includes a figure for NI and, in an identical fashion to tax on account, HMRC will also expect payment of NI on account.</p>\n<p>This can add a considerable amount of class 4 NI contributions to many self-employed people’s January payment and is worth calculating in advance to avoid a surprise addition to your end of year bill.</p>\n<p>To navigate the complexities of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax returns</a>, especially when factoring in National Insurance contributions, consider seeking <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">guidance from a self-assessment accountant</a> to ensure accurate calculations and avoid unexpected costs.</p>\n<h2>Moving from sole trader to limited company</h2>\n<p>Of the many advantages that exist for moving from a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> to a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> is the different method of tax that you pay. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited companies</a> do not have to pay tax on account, and if you are of a suitable business size, making the change can lead to a drop in your tax bill, in addition to limitation of liability and an enhanced (perceived) reputation. However, if you draw down high levels of dividends you will continue to fall under the payment on account regime personally.</p>\n<h2>Payments on Account and Coronavirus</h2>\n<p>We did our best not to mention the C********** word in this blog, but even Payments on Account are impacted here.</p>\n<p>If you are on payments on accounts for 2018/19, meaning your second payment on account is ordinarily due by 31 July 2020, this date is automatically deferred until 31 January 2021. Whilst we welcome this as a short-term cashflow help (effectively a six-month extension), don&#8217;t forget it is still due, so some of our client&#8217;s will be paying it as usual to avoid having to pay even more by 31 January 2021.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting &#8211; here to help you</h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, we can help you with your end of year tax return, as well as looking at your complete financial situation and giving you professional advice on how to ensure you are paying the correct amount of tax.

For example, business travel and subsistence, work phone bills, business entertainment expenses and uniform and tools for work.</p>\n<p>To qualify for an exemption, you must be either be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>paying a flat rate to your employee as part of their earnings &#8211; this must be either a benchmark rate or a special (‘bespoke’) rate approved by HMRC</li>\n<li>paying back the employee’s actual costs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don’t need to apply for an exemption if you’re paying HMRC’s benchmark rates for allowable expenses, such as mileage allowance or no/low-interest loans.</p>\n<h2>Benefit in Kind Deadlines</h2>\n<p>An employer has until 6 July following the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2020/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"210\">end of the tax</a> year to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit Form P11Ds online to <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC;</abbr></li>\n<li>Give employees a copy of the information on your forms; and</li>\n<li>Tell <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> the total amount of Class 1A National Insurance owed on form P11D(b).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example for the tax year ending 5th April 2020, the deadline will be 6 July 2020.</p>\n<p>Other deadlines include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>22 July (19 July by cheque) to pay any Class 1A National Insurance owed on expenses or benefits; and</li>\n<li>22 October (19 October by cheque) if you have a PAYE Settlement Agreement, to pay tax and and Class 1B National Insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Making an amendment to your Benefits in Kind</h2>\n<p>These must be filed using a paper form, even if you submitted the original version online.</p>\n<p>Here are a few tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include all the benefits and expenses for the tax year, not just the ones you want to change;</li>\n<li>On the Form P11D(b), similarly include the total amount of Class 1A National Insurance you need to pay, not the difference from your previous version.</li>\n<li>The forms online are typically from the latest tax year, so write a different tax year on the form, if you need to report a different year.</li>\n<li>Ensure that you write:\n<ul>\n<li>that you’re using the form to correct an error made in a different year to the one printed on the form; and</li>\n<li>the tax year you’re making the amendment for.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New or amended forms need to be sent to:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">P11D Support Team<br />\nBP2302<br />\nHM Revenue and Customs<br />\nDepartment 1250<br />\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne<br />\nNE98 1ZZ</p>\n<h2>PAYE Settlement Agreements and Payrolling</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, some employer&#8217;s choose to declare benefits in kind through their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">payroll</a> each known, also known as payrolling. Where these benefits are minor, irregular or impracticable a PAYE Settlement Agreement can be used instead. More on both of these schemes can be found in our recent blog.</p>\n<h2>Benefit in Kind Penalties</h2>\n<p>A penalty of £100 per 50 employees for each month or part month a P11D(b) is late is applied. Interest and penalties are also payable where HMRC are paid late.</p>\n<p>Finally, penalties can also be charged if you carelessly or deliberately give inaccurate information in any filing, which results in either the employer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not paying enough tax; and/or</li>\n<li>Over-claiming <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">tax reliefs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Specialist tax advice from Black and White Accounting</strong></h2>\n<p>This is all in a day&#8217;s work for our specialist <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">payroll</a> team.

      "content": "<p>This is the most Frequently Asked Question from our clients this week, so we thought we&#8217;d prepare a blog to answer these questions head-on. This is because where a Limited Company Director furloughs themselves, they are not able to work, therefore, they can only fulfil their duties as a Director of a Limited Company.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Statutory Duties</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/contents\">Companies Act 2006</a> outlines the statutory duties of company directors as seven general duties;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Duty to act within your powers as a company director</li>\n<li>Duty to promote the success of your company</li>\n<li>Duty to exercise independent judgement</li>\n<li>Duty to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-services/the-best-due-diligence-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence</a></li>\n<li>Duty to avoid conflicts of interest</li>\n<li>Duty not to accept benefits from third parties; and</li>\n<li>Duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement with the company.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These still apply if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you’re not active in your role as director</li>\n<li>someone else tells you what to do</li>\n<li>you act as a director but have not been formally appointed; and/or</li>\n<li>you control a board of directors without being on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"companys-constitution\">1. Powers as a company director</h3>\n<p>You must follow the company’s constitution and its articles of association. These are written rules about running the company, agreed by the members, directors and the company secretary. The constitution sets out what powers you’re granted as a director, and the purpose of those powers. These days most companies use a templated or standard set of articles of association, so these duties are likely to be generic as a result.</p>\n<h3 id=\"promote-the-success-of-the-company\">2. Promote the success of the company</h3>\n<p>You must act in the company’s best interests to promote its success. You must consider the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>consequences of decisions, including the long term;</li>\n<li>interests of its employees;</li>\n<li>need to support business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;</li>\n<li>impact of its operations on the community and environment;</li>\n<li>company’s reputation for high standards of business conduct; and</li>\n<li>need to act fairly to all members of the company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the company becomes insolvent, your responsibilities as director will apply towards the creditors, instead of the company, i.e., anyone owed money by the company. If an Insolvency Practitioner is appointed to close down the company they have to make an assessment to ensure you fulfilled your duties as a Director, and if you fell short here, they have a duty to report you to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/insolvency-service\">Insolvency Service</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"independent-judgement\">3. Independent judgement</h3>\n<p>You must not allow other people to control your powers as a director. You can accept advice, but you must use your own independent judgement to make final decisions. You make the decisions and you are ultimately responsible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exercise-reasonable-care-skill-and-diligence\">4. Exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence</h3>\n<p>You must perform to the best of your ability. The more qualified or experienced you are, the greater the standard expected of you. You must use any relevant knowledge, skill or experience you have (for example, if you’re a qualified accountant). These responsibilities are not to be taken lightly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-conflicts-of-interest\">5, Avoid conflicts of interest</h3>\n<p>You must avoid situations where your loyalties might be divided. You should consider the positions and interests of your family, to avoid possible conflicts. You should tell other directors and members about any possible conflict of interest, and follow any process set out in the company’s articles of association (if applicable), Shareholder or Partnership Agreement.</p>\n<p>This duty continues to apply if you’re no longer a director. You must not take advantage of any property, information or opportunity you became aware of as a director.</p>\n<h3 id=\"third-party-benefits\">6. Third party benefits</h3>\n<p>You must not accept benefits from a third party that are offered to you because you’re a director. This could cause a conflict of interest. The company may allow you to accept benefits like reasonable corporate hospitality, if it’s clear there’s no conflict of interest, or they have minimal value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interests-in-a-transaction\">7. Interests in a transaction</h3>\n<p>You must tell the other directors and members if you might personally benefit from a transaction the company makes. For example, if the company plans to enter a contract with a business owned by a member of your family.</p>\n<h2>Furlough during the Covid-19</h2>\n<p>During the current Coronavirus crisis, the Government has setup the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-could-be-covered-by-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">Job Retention Scheme</a>. Here employees can be paid 80% of their wages, up to a monthly cap of £2,500, if they are put &#8216;on furlough&#8217; which means not working. It is a way for workers to get cashflow and be retained by their employers, who would otherwise have been forced to release them.</p>\n<p>Director&#8217;s can also be put on furlough. However, if they do this, it will limit what they are able to do in the business, as they will &#8216;not be able to work&#8217;, but will still need to fulfil their statutory duties as a company director, as outlined above.</p>\n<h2>Contact Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>At times like these especially we need to help each other as we are in this together.

The big updates below are principally on the Support of Charities, Income Support Scheme, Job Retention Scheme and Rates Relief and Grants.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<p>In addition to posting regular updates on our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/news/\">blogs</a>, we are also active across social media (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blackandwhiteacc/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bandwaccountants/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/black-&amp;-white-chartered-certified-accountants/\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BandWAccounting\">Twitter</a>) so please follow us here. You can also subscribe to our Newsletter at the bottom of our homepage, or by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">emailing us</a> your first name and surname.</p>\n<h2>Support of Charities</h2>\n<p>New measures were announced last night in regards to the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/charity-accounting-services/\">Charity sector</a>. We are still waiting for more flesh on the bone, but we currently understand there will be a £750 million package of support for frontline charities. This will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£360 million direct from government departments; and</li>\n<li>£370 million for small and medium charities, including a grant through the National Lottery Community Fund. We understand tens of thousands of charities providing <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">vital services</a> will benefit from direct cash grants to ensure they can meet the increasing demand for their services as a result of the current crisis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-sets-out-extra-750-million-coronavirus-funding-for-frontline-charities\">the government will match donations to the National Emergencies Trust</a>, as part of the BBC’s Big Night In fundraiser later this month to a minimum of £20 million. Don’t forget, Charities are also eligible under the Job Retention Scheme (more below) and <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/\">Oxfam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/\">Age UK</a> have already furloughed 2/3 of their staff as a result.</p>\n<p>Whilst it is great that charities are specifically getting the recognition for the critical role they play, especially at this time, some Charity Chiefs believe the black hole for charities is closer to £4bn. As more specific guidance is provided here, we will update you accordingly.</p>\n<h2>Income Support Scheme</h2>\n<p>Here the self-employed can claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their trading profits up to a maximum of £2,500 per month for the next 3 months (extended if needed). This will be available for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those with trading profits worth up to £50,000;</li>\n<li>Where the majority of income is from self-employment;\n<ul>\n<li>Only those already in self-employment who have <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> for 2018/19; and</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Will be provided even if you are still able to work, unlike the Job Retention Scheme outlined below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t forget if you, or anyone you know, haven’t submitted their 2018/19 tax return yet, please get in touch with us today, as this will need to be done before you can make an application. You have just two weeks to do this, with the deadline being 23 April. At this stage, we understand payments are still likely to be received in June.</p>\n<p>It is likely the online application will be part of the Government Gateway. Therefore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you would like us to do this for you, we have gone through and checked that we have authorisation to talk to HMRC on your behalf. If we didn’t have access, we have requested this, so you should receive a code through the post in the coming days. Please share this with us as soon as you receive it, so we are ready to go.</li>\n<li>If you want to do this yourself, make sure you have access to your own <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self-Assessment tax return</a> online account. If you already have a government gateway account, please log in to make sure it works, and your password is correct or is renewed. Then ensure that Self-Assessment online services is available or you to use. If it is not, please follow the instructions to add it. You will need your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> number and Unique Tax Reference to hand when you do. If you do not have a government gateway account already, please click <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services\">here </a>to set one up. An activation code will need to be posted to you which is why we suggest you action this now. If assistance is required, consider consulting with a  <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">professional self-assessment accountant for guidance</a> through the necessary procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we haven’t seen the exact process, we don’t know how long it will take to complete the application. For this reason, we cannot confirm if/how much we will charge for this process, but please be reassured we will keep it as low as physically possible, especially given the current climate. We will update you, as soon as we know further.</p>\n<h2>Job Retention Scheme</h2>\n<p>This is the ‘furlough’ scheme for employees and potentially Directors, where if they are not working (effectively laid off), HMRC will reimburse 80% of their pay for up to £2,500 per person per month, where the individuals are furloughed for at least three weeks. We have a furlough template, if you would find this useful, please ask, although we have already provided it to many of you.</p>\n<p>If you are a Company Director and considering furloughing yourself, please read our blog on the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-duties-of-a-director-of-a-limited-company/\">Statutory Duties of a Director of a Limited Company</a>. for clarity on what you can and cannot do. If you are on furlough, you cannot work, you are limited only to fulfilling your seven duties as a Company Director, which this blog explains further.</p>\n<p>The big update is you will be able to claim funding from the government using a new portal if you have furloughed any of your employees, as soon as 20 April. Although we have not yet been given full guidance from HMRC, it appears that the funding will need to be claimed through the government gateway service for employers.</p>\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">we do your payroll</a> for you, you can rest assured we will take care of this for you. Where we aren’t currently authorised as your agent for PAYE, we requested this yesterday and contacted you to say a code will be coming through. As soon as you receive this, please share this with us so we are good to go.</li>\n<li>If you use an alternative payroll provider, make sure they are authorised to act on your behalf with HMRC on PAYE. However, if you wish, we’d be delighted to help you.</li>\n<li>If you do your own payroll, make sure you have access to your PAYE online account. If you already have a government gateway account, please log in to make sure it works, and your password is correct or is renewed. Then ensure that PAYE Online for Employers is listed as a service that you can use. If it is not, please follow the instructions to add it. You will need your PAYE reference number and accounts office reference number to hand when you do. If you do not have a government gateway account already, please click <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services\">here </a>to set one up. An activation code will need to be posted to you which is why we suggest you action this now. However, if this all sounds like too much work, we’d be delighted to help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned above, we haven’t seen the exact process and don’t know how long it will take. Due to this, we cannot confirm if/how much we will charge for this process, but please be reassured we will keep it as low as physically possible, especially given the current climate. However, payrolls this month took up to five times longer than usual, due to all the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">furlough calculations</a>, none of which we will charge for, as a goodwill gesture. We will update you, as soon as we know anything further.</p>\n<p>To make any of the above applications, we understand you will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your ePAYE reference number;</li>\n<li>the number of employees being furloughed;</li>\n<li>the claim period (start and end date);</li>\n<li>amount claimed (per the minimum length of furloughing of 3 consecutive weeks);</li>\n<li>your bank account number and sort code;</li>\n<li>your contact name; and</li>\n<li>your phone number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will need to calculate the amount you are claiming and HMRC will retain the right to retrospectively audit all aspects of your claim. Don’t forget the normal terms &amp; conditions of employment are the same, unless your employees agree to forgo these. Do speak to a HR Specialist or Solicitor if you need to.</p>\n<p>This scheme is likely to cost £30-40bn over three months based on the latest numbers and the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) suggest nearly a fifth of smaller firms plan to furlough all their staff and 50% of companies are putting most of their staff into the scheme. There is, however, still some areas where we are lacking clarity, for example on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/welcome-evinta-to-the-black-white-accounting-team/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"105\">Apprentices</a>, but we will keep you updated.</p>\n<p>As we mention below, HMRC has set up a specific hotline where employees can inform on their employers who furlough them, but still expect them to work, so make sure you stay both within the letter and the spirit of the law here.</p>\n<h2>Rates Relief and Grants</h2>\n<p>Here businesses who get small business rate relief or rural rate relief will get grant funding of £10,000 and there is additional grant funding of £25,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses with property with a rateable value between £15,000 and £51,000.</p>\n<p>As these are administered by local councils, the status and process will depend on the council in question. Some councils are automatically getting in touch with businesses to confirm details and have made BACs transfers directly, others expect you to apply and they will get back to you. All of them now appear to be live and typically grants are transferred in a matter of days.</p>\n<p>We recommend that if you believe you are eligible, you get in touch with your council today. Typically, you will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Reference (can be found on Rates bill);</li>\n<li>Property Reference (as above);</li>\n<li>Business or Company Name;</li>\n<li>Unique Tax Reference or Company Number;</li>\n<li>VAT Number (if applicable);</li>\n<li>Business Address;</li>\n<li>Applicant Name, Address and Title; and</li>\n<li>Bank Details for the Grant (bank, sort-code, account number and name of account)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us know if we can help you with any of this.</p>\n<h2>Business Interruption Loan</h2>\n<p>Offering loans of up to £5 million for SMEs through the <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/\">British Business Bank</a>, interest-free for up to 12 months, it could make a difference on some businesses, although it is still a loan and needs to be repaid.</p>\n<p>This has been live for a couple of weeks now. However, so far, despite the Chancellor’s revamps to the scheme last week, as of yesterday just 2,022 loans had been made from around 300,000 applications, or 0.65% success rate. The £291.9m lent is microscopic especially when compared to the SME’s monthly payroll costs of roughly £41bn. This is progress of sorts versus the previous week, but it is still far behind what the Government intended. The removal of personal guarantees for loans less than £250,000 will help.</p>\n<p>From our experience, whilst the conversation can be easier with your existing bank (if they are one of the 40+ lenders), do consider others on the panel, if required as some are more flexible than others. Also, we understand that if you are not successful with an application, it should not impact your credit rating and some businesses are finding success from re-applying, so if at first you don’t succeed (potentially consider), try, try again…</p>\n<h2>Deferring VAT Payments</h2>\n<p>If you are VAT registered your next payment of VAT (up to 30 June 2020) will be automatically deferred until the end of the 2020/21 financial year. If you pay by Direct Debit, this should be cancelled and reinstated before the next payment is due, to ensure HMRC do not take the payment out accidentally. However, VAT returns still have to be submitted as normal.</p>\n<h2>Deferring Income Tax Payments</h2>\n<p>If you pay under payment on accounts, your second payment for 2019/20 due 31 July 2020 can be deferred to 31 January 2021. This is an automatic entitlement, you don’t need to apply for it, but it is optional. You will still need to make this payment, so we are aware some of you are looking to pay it as normal or have already paid it.</p>\n<h2>Statutory Sick Pay Relief</h2>\n<p>They will refund up to two weeks of SSP per eligible employee, subject to the usual criteria.</p>\n<h2>Universal Credit</h2>\n<p>Enhanced for the self-employed, as is Housing Benefit. Nearly a million people have successfully claimed Universal Credit in the last two weeks, compared to about 100,000 applicants in a normal two-week period. You will need to be patient and it will take time (don’t blame the staff who are trying to help as best they can), but the support is here for you. This is subject to the usual criteria, however, only applies to those with savings less than £16,000. However, the cash advances now available could really make a difference to some.</p>\n<h2>Government Helpline</h2>\n<p>In addition to providing <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dc23f9d3b8a97c8596e4c0b85&amp;id=a1028c643f&amp;e=6344dda2a4\">help and support</a> they can arrange payment plans above and beyond the usual <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dc23f9d3b8a97c8596e4c0b85&amp;id=321ff3c419&amp;e=6344dda2a4\">time to pay</a> rules. Like with Universal Credit, you have to be patient, and you will need key financial information to hand to have a good conversation with them.</p>\n<h2>Directors of Limited Companies</h2>\n<p>We appreciate especially for Directors of Limited companies there is still much to be desired when it comes to these support schemes.</p>\n<p>Whilst we don’t know for certain, at this stage, we do not believe that further measures of support to help you are likely to be forthcoming, unless of course the crisis goes on for much longer than they anticipate. Whilst we would love to be proved wrong, it appears the Government have made a conscious decision here; their rationale appears to be if they considered Dividends in the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, these would include both from your own limited company, but also from much bigger companies (e.g., listed companies) and they are unsure if they would be able to distinguish between the two. Also there may have been many hints that they will look to tax everyone more in line with employees going forward , we will of course keep you updated if there are any changes here.</p>\n<h2>Fraud is still Fraud</h2>\n<p>Don’t forget, fraud is still fraud, no matter what the climate. If you try and claim where you are not eligible for the support schemes, HMRC will not only look to claw-back the support provided, plus interest and penalties, they will also consider criminal prosecution. HMRC have already set up a specific hotline where employees can inform that they have been furloughed but are continuing to work and we expect more similar measures to follow.</p>\n<h2>Anything Else?</h2>\n<p>Aside from the schemes mentioned, there are plenty of other things which you can do to help you and your business survive at the present time.</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act now, plan, prepare and be ready, whatever the scenario;</li>\n<li>Prepare cashflow models for your business, to understand how your position is looking and when your issues will arise under different scenarios;</li>\n<li>Go through your profit and loss account; are there any costs you can strip out? Today, next week, next month? Do you need to set the ball-rolling now, especially as some services require a notice period;</li>\n<li>If you have a landlord (for business or personal) talk to them and see if there is any flexibility in your current arrangement. They are potentially getting relief, maybe they can pass this along to you to keep you as a tenant?;</li>\n<li>Manage your debtors and creditors. Don’t pay anyone before you need to and get money in from your customers as quickly as you can. Maybe look to see if you can extend credit terms, payment days or put things on direct debit to spread payments and ultimately improve your working capital;</li>\n<li>If you have any lenders, keep communicating. If you are going to have any issues with payment, the earlier you communicate the better. However, you never know, they may be able to accept delay payments, payment holidays or potentially even extend your current facility. Again, they might be getting some help here, so maybe they can pass this over to you. We have seen flexibility on mortgages, credit cards, store cards and overdrafts so it’s worth having a conversation; and</li>\n<li>On the personal front, we have seen some local councils allow payment holidays for rates on residential homes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Updates</h2>\n<p>We will continue to keep you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-update-24-september-2020/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"200\">updated as more information about the existing support</a> packages, or indeed new packages become available. If, however, there is anything else you would like to see us do, please just let us know. Please get in touch with us, if you would like to be added to our Newsletter and you will get this information even sooner.</p>\n<p>Rishi Sunak’s words yesterday “We depend on each other” could not be truer and we all need to do whatever we can to help and support those around us at this time. But he also added that he couldn’t help everyone and again hinted that the differences between the ways the self-employed and the employed are taxed could be addressed. Whilst the above measures are likely to be extended, should the lockdown continue, it feels less likely now that there would be a package of support specifically aimed at those who are left behind, including Directors of Limited Companies. We would love to be proved wrong here. If you are having to make tough decisions as a result, do get in touch so we can talk it through, you are not alone at this time.</p>\n<p>We hope you find these updates useful. We don’t have all the answers currently as new information is coming out every hour, but we will continue to keep you informed, as and when we get substantial updates.

A lot of limited companies in particular and their Directors have been left behind without any support, nor much hope of it being business as usual for weeks if not months to come. Why not consider R&amp;D Tax Credits to get what you are entitled to but reducing/removing your corporation tax and even potentially creating cash to help support your business at this time?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The UK government&#8217;s ambition is to grow Research &amp; Development (&#8216;R&amp;D&#8217;) to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, to make us a global leader, from the current levels of around 1.7% of GDP. There is a lot more work to be done here. In the post-Brexit world, this will also become even more critical if the UK is to grow and attract investment.</p>\n<h2>What are R&amp;D tax credits?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">HMRC R&amp;D tax credits</a> were established to drive innovation and recognise UK businesses that invest in research and development of new products, processes or services (or enhancing existing ones) allowing them to invest in further R&amp;D and growth.</p>\n<p>Since the scheme began in 2000, £26.9bn in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">tax relief</a> has been reclaimed. The average claim value for SMEs in 2016-17 was £53,876. This could really make the difference between a business continuing to trade or going out of business, and yet many companies don’t know about the scheme and may be missing out.</p>\n<p>Do you think your business may be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">eligible for R&amp;D tax credits</a>? If so, what do you need to know? Black and White Accounting are here to provide you with the answers and help you r<a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">eclaim your tax</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>R&amp;D tax credit eligibility</strong></h2>\n<p>To qualify for R&amp;D tax relief, work must be part of a project to make advances in science or technology and must relate this to what the company does or intends to do based on the R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>Your business can be in any sector but you must be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">liable for UK Corporation tax</a> and have spent money on a qualifying R&amp;D project, which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Looks for an advance in science and technology;</li>\n<li>Shows you overcoming uncertainty;</li>\n<li>Explains how you are overcoming uncertainty; and/or</li>\n<li>Shows that the problem couldn’t be easily worked out by a professional in the field</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are still allowed to make a claim even if your research project isn’t successful.</p>\n<h2><strong>How much is the R&amp;D tax relief?</strong></h2>\n<p>The type of R&amp;D tax relief paid is dependent on the size of a company. An SME (less than 500 staff and an turnover under €100 million or a balance sheet under €86m) can claim either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an extra 130% of their qualifying costs from their yearly profit, as well as the normal 100% deduction, to make a total 230% deduction; or</li>\n<li>claim a tax credit if the company is making a loss, worth up to 14.5% of the surrenderable loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Large companies can claim R&amp;D Expenditure Credit of 13% following the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/2020-budget/\">2020 Budget</a>. This was previously 12p for every £1 spent on qualifying R&amp;D expenditure from 1 January 2018 (11% of your qualifying R&amp;D expenditure up to 31 December 2017).</p>\n<h2><strong>Making an R&amp;D tax credit claim</strong></h2>\n<p>Claims for R&amp;D tax credits can be made to HMRC through your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">Company Tax Return</a> and you can go as far back as two accounting periods. It normally takes four to six weeks for HMRC to process.</p>\n<h2><strong>Case Study</strong></h2>\n<p>One of our client’s is an API-developer. They are in their infancy with high levels of investment to fund their growth and capability development. As a result of our support, they were able to claim nearly £100,000 as a tax refund from HMRC during 2018, which is critical for their very survival. This is a great example of where R&amp;D tax credits can help innovation, investment and ultimately growth in the UK.</p>\n<p>Other clients we help in this space are typically Marketing Agents and Software Developers. However, as long as there&#8217;s innovation, there is an opportunity to claim; we also have some <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">construction clients</a> who have successfully claimed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Business advice and accounting services in Hampshire and Surrey</strong></h2>\n<p>We specialise in providing R&amp;D <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">Tax Credit services</a> to both our clients and those who use other Accountants. Whilst there are some specialists in this area, they typically charge fees based on the reclaim amount, which can be as much as 20-40% of this amount plus VAT. Rather than charge such an eye-watering amount, we charge either based on our hourly rates, or as a fixed fee, to ensure you don’t get any surprises and get maximum benefit for your hard work.</p>\n<p>We help businesses of all shapes and sizes to grow by providing a pro-active, personal and informative <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">accounting service</a> as and when it’s needed.</p>\n<p>Interested in hearing more about what we can offer you?

      "content": "<p>It would be easy for us to say “choose Black and White Accounting for all your accounting needs”, but before we jump to that inevitable conclusion, it is worth a look at what makes a good accountant and the things you should consider for your business. Perhaps we are right for you, or perhaps not &#8211; either way, we are here to help. It&#8217;s what gets us up in the morning&#8230;</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Online or Local Accountants</h2>\n<p>For most small businesses looking to find an accountant for the first time, it’s a lot more than simply having someone <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">sort out your tax returns</a>. An accountant often becomes a substantial part of your working experience; acting as confidante, advisor and friend. That doesn’t have to be the case, of course, and if you simply want someone to sort out the figures and otherwise be invisible, then your accountant can certainly do that, too!</p>\n<p>But it should be your choice. In the world of internet communications and video conferencing, there’s no real need for an accountant that is local to you; but for many businesses, that personal touch makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>No matter where your accountant is based, current software means a good accountant will be able to help you in every aspect of your business remotely, from logging receipts for expenses to discussing the finer points of your annual profit.</p>\n<p>So, local or online &#8211; it really is a personal choice.</p>\n<h2>Accounting Accreditations</h2>\n<p>In the UK, anyone can call themselves an accountant, but there’s a vast difference between a chartered accountant with the appropriate qualifications and full understanding of tax law, and someone with a copy of excel and a polished LinkedIn profile!</p>\n<p>It is extremely important that you check the credentials of your accountant. In the UK there are four main bodies that provide certification for accountants, so look for these and, if in doubt, ask! Professional accountants will always be able to provide you with their credentials and will never find a query regarding their accreditation disrespectful. They have spent years doing exams and even longer gaining relevant experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ACA &#8211; Associate Chartered Accountant: A business diploma from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) that is well regarded around the world.</li>\n<li>ACCA &#8211; Associate Chartered Certified Accountant: The official qualification from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), this certification is held by our own Jon Mills, Managing Director of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>.</li>\n<li>CA – similar to the ACA above but awarded by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland.</li>\n<li>CIMA &#8211; Chartered Institute of Management Accountant: Focussed on business accountancy, CIMA qualified individuals often work as a business accountant rather than independent accountants but are full qualified in both areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also check the accounting firm to see that they are a member of the Association of International Accountants (AIA) or Institute of Financial Accountants (IFA).</p>\n<p>If you have any unresolved doubts about your potential accountant’s credentials, it is far better to walk away and find an alternative than become tied to someone without the relevant knowledge and training.</p>\n<h2>Existing Client Portfolio and Experience</h2>\n<p>It doesn’t hurt to ask your prospective accountant about their current clients to see if they are used to handling people in a similar situation to yourself. If you are a small one-man band, then a firm that only has large businesses on their books is probably a poor fit; similarly, in reverse. Look for an accountant who understands your business and can talk confidently about issues that affect you. Also check, do they offer a full suite of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">Accounts &amp; Tax</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">Book Keeping &amp; Payroll</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Business Planning</a> and Software Training?</p>\n<h2>Accountant Recommendations</h2>\n<p>If you know other business owners, then talk to them about their experiences with accountants. Good accountants will retain their clients for many years, and those happy clients will usually be more than happy to recommend the service they receive. Word of mouth is always the best source to find your next accountant.</p>\n<h2>Trust Yourself</h2>\n<p>Have an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">initial meeting</a> with a potential accountant, whether in person or virtually, and get to know them. Like anyone you plan to work with for a long time to come, interviewing your accountant provides you with a personal interaction and will help you form an initial opinion of them and their services. Do you walk away from that first meeting invigorated and thinking of all the ways your life will be made easier by them, or are you unsure, finding there were small things that put you off? You do not have to jump on board with the first accountancy firm you meet with; it is a relationship that will become very important to your business so it is one you will want to get right.</p>\n<p>Your perfect accountant will click with you, so if you are not getting those positive vibes, consider saying thanks, but no thanks, and looking for an alternative.</p>\n<h2>Discuss Your Business</h2>\n<p>Some accountants are proactive, others are happy to just do the minimum required and complete a tax return when relevant.</p>\n<p>Your business will benefit from a driven and engaged accountant who offers suggestions as to how you can grow and improve; someone who helps you think about your options and makes recommendations such as software that might improve your administration, or ways to streamline your operation.</p>\n<p>Again, this is something that will come out in an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">initial meeting</a>; discuss your business and see if it sparks the accountant, if it doesn’t then maybe you’re not quite right for them!</p>\n<h2>Be Wary of Boasts</h2>\n<p>There are many ways an accountant can help your business, but anyone who boasts about helping you evade tax is not someone you want to be working with. There’s a vast difference between properly utilising tax advantages you might be entitled to, and illegal tax evasion &#8211; and remember, it’s ultimately you who will <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"191\">end up in trouble with the tax</a> office!</p>\n<p>A good accountant has no need to boast or impress you with outlandish claims; avoid those that offer miracles. As they say, if it’s too good to be true…</p>\n<h2>Why Choose Black and White Accounting?</h2>\n<p>Here are ten simple reasons we think you should consider us as your Accountants:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We work however you want to work; we understand you, your requirements and can ensure you get what you need from your Accountants;</li>\n<li>We offer a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">free initial meeting</a>, to get to know you, your business and understand how we can best support you;</li>\n<li>We offer bespoke fixed fees, so there are no nasty surprises.

      "content": "<p>Growing a business is a very exciting prospect. Once that first hurdle; of moving from employed to self-employed, is passed, one of the next milestones comes in the transition from a self-employed Sole Trader to a Limited Company.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Why would you want to change to a Limited Company?</h2>\n<h3>1 &#8211; Limited liability</h3>\n<p>The first benefit is made clear by the title for the type of Company: <em>limited</em> refers to the level of liability represented by the Company Directors. Importantly, it is very different from the full liability level of a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">Sole Trader</a>.</p>\n<p>The law makes no distinction between the individual and the Sole Trade business itself, meaning a mistake or problem that is the responsibility of the business is equally a direct and full responsibility for the individual.</p>\n<p>Essentially, this means that any Sole Trader debt is also viewed as personal debt; that any legal claims for compensation on the business would also be claims against the individual</p>\n<p>Bankruptcy for a Sole Trader business is also a bankruptcy for the owner. This is not the case with a Limited Company.</p>\n<p>With incorporation comes a separation between the individual and the business &#8211; even if the individual remains the sole employee of the business. There is no longer the fear that personal assets (for example, your home) are at risk due to business-related activities.</p>\n<h3>2 &#8211; Corporation tax vs. income tax</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-planning-and-structuring-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax structure</a> for limited companies is quite different to that of a basic self-employed Sole Trader. The most significant difference is that a Limited Company pays <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax on profits</a>, rather than income tax. Under the current Conservative government, corporation tax is a significant advantage when compared to income tax and currently stands at 19%.</p>\n<p>Compared with the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">basic income tax rate</a> of 20% and the higher rate of 40%, corporation tax represents a saving of many thousands of pounds to many business owners.</p>\n<p>There are other tax benefits to being a Limited Company, with a wider range of allowances and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"194\">planning opportunities</a> available.</p>\n<h3>3 &#8211; Legitimacy</h3>\n<p>Businesses live and die by their reputation. Incorporating to become a Limited Company can increase your legitimacy in the eyes of many prospective clients and open the door to a wider range of business options. Indeed, many larger businesses have a policy against working with Sole Traders due to feared instability and long-term support.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but your business name is registered with Companies House, identifying you and protecting you from copycats This can often help, especially if you work in a crowded marketplace, offering a level of protection and branding identity beyond the simple level of a Sole Trader. You no longer have the worry that someone is trading under the same name, damaging your business.</p>\n<h3>4 &#8211; Funding</h3>\n<p>Many funding partners are unwilling to enter into agreements with Sole Traders, seeing investment often as simply putting the money directly into the pocket of the self-employed individual rather than it being distinctly banked by the business and under greater levels of scrutiny and protection from fraud.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for external investors to help your business grow, then it would be wise to consider forming a Limited Company beforehand.</p>\n<h3>5 &#8211; The lure of shares</h3>\n<p>Ownership of a Limited Company is made up of several Shareholders, each of whom owns a portion of the Company. Offering shares, and thus a ‘cut of the pie’ to prospective employees as an extra incentive beyond salary is an excellent way to increase productivity and loyalty. This will also provide you with something to offer when the current level of financial strength in the Company isn’t enough to entice the top talent.</p>\n<p>Many people have accepted positions in limited companies with a tiny salary but with an alluring shares package and have gone on to help grow those companies into strong institutions, realising their investment fully.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Directors and Shareholders</h2>\n<p>Unlike when working as a Sole Trader, a Limited Company is made up of Shareholders and Directors &#8211; the people (and in some cases, other companies) that own and manage the Company.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that Directors can be Shareholders and vice versa, and that also a person can be just a Director or just a Shareholder. Being appointed as either isn’t a limitation.</p>\n<h3>Company Shareholders</h3>\n<p>Shareholders (also known as ‘members’) are the owners of the Company. Each <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ive-been-offered-shares-in-a-limited-company-what-ownership-should-i-ask-for/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"86\">Limited Company’s ownership is divided into multiple shares</a> which, when combined, total 100% of the Company.</p>\n<p>It is possible to have sole ownership of a Limited Company, considered to be a single Shareholder with 100% ownership. Often a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/when-should-i-be-a-sole-trader-rather-than-a-limited-company/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"76\">Sole Trader moving to Limited Company</a> status will begin in this way.</p>\n<p>Shareholders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can be either an individual or a corporate body;</li>\n<li>are limited in liability to a portion equal to their share;</li>\n<li>receive a portion of the profit equal to their share percentage (dividends);</li>\n<li>are not involved with the business management or activities unless also Directors; and</li>\n<li>have voting rights and power over significant issues equal to the percentage of their share (can depend on the type of shares as determined by the Prescribed Particulars).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Company Directors</h3>\n<p>Also known as Company Officers, the Directors are the top-level employees responsible for running the Company.</p>\n<p>In a new Limited Company grown from a Sole Trader, it is likely that the only Director will also be the owner, however, as the Company builds, it will become necessary to appoint additional Directors to take on some of the demands of running the business.</p>\n<p>Unlike Shareholders, there must always be at least one human Director in a Company. There is no need for a Director to also be a Shareholder.</p>\n<p>Directors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can be either an individual or a corporate body;</li>\n<li>are appointed by the Shareholders;</li>\n<li>are responsible under the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association to manage the Company lawfully and ethically;</li>\n<li>promote the success of the business making a profit for the benefit of the Company and its Shareholders;</li>\n<li>are an employee and receive a salary;</li>\n<li>are legally responsible for filing true and fair annual accounts, Annual Returns and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Company Tax Returns</a> by the statutory deadlines;</li>\n<li>are responsible for paying all Company taxes on time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the disadvantages of a Limited Company?</h2>\n<p>Of course, while there are many benefits of incorporation, it isn’t right for everyone. Many small businesses find the additional legal structure and paperwork an extra burden they would rather not shoulder, others don’t reach a level of turnover to make the financial benefits valuable enough to make the move and some just don’t get the fact that the Company and they as an individual are two separate legal entities, struggling to manage their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/why-cant-my-directors-loan-account-be-overdrawn/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"130\">Directors’ Loan Account</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the other legal ramifications of becoming a Limited Company includes a level of transparency that may not be appealing. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited Company accounts</a> are published on the Companies House website and information regarding Directors and Shareholders is publicly available for all to access.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, we can discuss your current structure and help you determine when it is best to make the move to a Limited Company. We will look at your accounts in detail, and discuss the options with you in full, from the various tax structures to the fees associated with business bank accounts.</p>\n<h2>The process of changing from Sole Trader to Limited Company</h2>\n<p>It is relatively easy to convert from a Sole Trader to a Limited Company with our help. Black and White Accounting can undertake most of the process for you. As your Accountant, we will register all the required paperwork with HMRC, Companies House and all other appropriate taxes for the new Company. You can also use our address to ensure your personal address is not in the public domain.</p>\n<p>What you will need to do is choose a suitable Company name &#8211; it’s something you are going to be working with for many years, so make sure you go with a name you are happy with, that represents who you are as a brand and (most importantly) isn’t already taken, or protected! The hardest part is setting up a bank account, but thankfully there is some improvement in this space.</p>\n<h2>The role of an Accountant in a Limited Company</h2>\n<p>With the increased paperwork, declaring dividends and paying you through a proper payroll system, there is more need for an Accountant when running a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited Company</a> than there is for a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">Sole Trader</a>.</p>\n<p>While this cost is offset against corporation tax and is likely to be far smaller than the gains made in moving to a Limited Company model, it is still something that you should consider before making your final decision.</p>\n<p>We believe in transparency at Black and White Accounting and will discuss our role alongside the other benefits of becoming a Limited Company to ensure you make your decision with complete understanding. The relationship between the Accountant and the major Shareholders and Directors in a Limited Company is an important one; we will help you to pass this milestone smoothly and move into another great period of stability and growth for your business, with us as your business partners every step of the way.</p>\n<h2>Limited Companies and the Coronavirus Crisis</h2>\n<p>Now it would be pertinent to add here that there is some frustration with the level of support Directors of Limited Companies have received as part of the Coronavirus Support Schemes, in what appears to be a deliberate act of the current Government. However, the advantages of being a Limited Company are still significant for a lot of Sole Traders.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting and your Limited Company</h2>\n<p>If you are earning over £35,000 as a Sole Trader, then you may find an advantage in moving to a Limited Company today and that’s just for tax reasons. There are several other reasons which could make this an attractive structure for you and your business. Some people choose to go directly to a Limited Company when they <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/startup-calculator/\">start up a business</a>, such are these advantages.</p>\n<p>For help from us here at Black and White Accounting, get in touch today; please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">email</a>, fill out our contact form or phone us on 0800 140 4644 and one of our expert team will be on the other end ready to help you.

      "content": "<p>When running a business, you find yourself at the front line for many problems. Not only are you the primary decision maker for where the business should go, but the concept of ‘the buck stops here’ ends up decisively at your feet.</p>\n<p>With the future of the business and people’s livelihoods at risk (including your own), there is a need to insure your business to put the right safety barriers between you and any potential problems. To help, we’ve provided information about the types of work insurance to consider.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Types of Business Insurance</h2>\n<p>When people talk of business insurance, it’s really a catch-all term for four more specific business insurance products. While these are not all needed by all businesses, each is a good idea if it is relevant.</p>\n<h3>Employers’ Liability Insurance</h3>\n<p>The first thing to mention regarding employer’s liability insurance is that it is a legal requirement if you employ one or more people. Consequently, it’s the primary form of business insurance available.</p>\n<p>Employer’s liability insurance (EL insurance) is there to provide financial cover for your employees should anything happen to them while in the workplace or undertaking activity for their work.</p>\n<p>Its purpose is to cover legal costs and compensation in case of any illness or injury that occurs while your employee is working for you. As an employer, you have a legal duty of care to follow all relevant health and safety recommendations relevant to your business, but still, accidents can happen.</p>\n<p>The breadth of situations employer’s liability insurance covers is significant, ranging from a trip or fall, to more complex cases such as a claim years later in retirement due to asbestos exposure during working years.</p>\n<p>In the UK, failure to have EL insurance in place for a business with staff can result in a daily fine of up to £2,500.</p>\n<h3>Public Liability Insurance</h3>\n<p>Though it is not a legal requirement, public liability insurance (PL insurance) should be obtained by any business that interacts with the public.</p>\n<p>Like employers’ liability insurance, PL insurance is there to cover the cost of legal support and any paid compensation that is required should a member of the public become injured or ill as a result of your business activity.</p>\n<p>While it is obvious that a business with a direct dealing with the public, such as a restaurant or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">construction business</a>, would require PL insurance, it is also advisable for many small businesses. Even if you work alone from a small office, you could find yourself in need of public liability insurance; a client who visits for a meeting and slips on the floor, for example, would be well within their rights to claim compensation from your business.</p>\n<p>The compensation claim industry in the UK is vast, with many legal teams in place to press for the largest values of compensation should an injury occur. Without public liability insurance, these costs can spiral and be very damaging for a business.</p>\n<h3>Professional Indemnity Insurance</h3>\n<p>Covering a group of specialist insurances, professional indemnity insurance is designed to protect your business and its employees from any legal action brought against you due to matters relating to work you have done.</p>\n<p>This can be quite wide-ranging, and it is important that your professional indemnity cover is specific for your industry.</p>\n<p>Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing cover for architects in case of complications due to their work;</li>\n<li>Protecting solicitors if advice given is poor;</li>\n<li>Insuring against complications arising after healthcare is provided;</li>\n<li>Covering graphic designers who mistakenly breach copyright;</li>\n<li>Protecting against loss of client data; and</li>\n<li>Providing legal support in slander or libel cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Professional indemnity insurance can be considered insurance against genuine mistakes that happen as part of your daily work and is very important for all businesses as they grow.</p>\n<h3>Product Indemnity Insurance</h3>\n<p>Sometimes placed under the same umbrella as professional indemnity, product indemnity insurance is specific for the manufacturing and retail industries and protects businesses from any problems that occur due to their products. This can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Injury that comes about from product use;</li>\n<li>Damage to property due to the product;</li>\n<li>Products mistakenly breaching patents; and</li>\n<li>Costs of recalling products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Product indemnity insurance is available for everyone in the product supply chain, from the original manufacturer, through to suppliers and end retailers. Often, a claim made against product indemnity can be quite complex, involving an original claim against a retailer passed back through the chain of supplier and manufacturer; for this reason, it is important that each link in that chain is properly protected.</p>\n<h3>Buildings Insurance</h3>\n<p>Buildings insurance is important for both business and personal life. If you or your business own a property, then it is important to get buildings insurance to cover the cost of any repairs to the property should it suffer damage.</p>\n<p>If you rent your premises, make sure that your landlord has the relevant buildings insurance to keep you safe.</p>\n<h3>Contents Insurance</h3>\n<p>A subsection of building insurance, contents insurance is available to protect your possessions inside the building, and is important for any business with assets, from furniture to specialised equipment.</p>\n<p>Note that standard contents insurance doesn’t typically cover retail stock or other specialised items and dedicated retail-based insurance is more suitable.</p>\n<p>If you lease or rent a property to run your business, then you will still need to get your own contents insurance; any similar insurance in place by your landlord will protect their interests but is unlikely to cover yours.</p>\n<h3>Commercial Vehicle/Fleet Insurance</h3>\n<p>Being properly insured while on the road is a legal requirement in the UK, and if you have a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vehicles/\">fleet of vehicles</a> for your business, it is important that you ensure all of them are correctly insured.</p>\n<p>Business use insurance is wider ranging than typical personal insurance (called ‘social domestic and pleasure’). Standard business car insurance provides cover to visit multiple client or customer sites (not covered in personal insurance), while higher levels of business cover are required if you use your vehicle as part of your business, such as a taxi or ice-cream van.</p>\n<p>Vehicle contents cover could also be required, to protect third-party items (such as parcels in a delivery van) or your own contents (tools left in the vehicle overnight, for example).</p>\n<h3>Retail Insurance</h3>\n<p>There are a range of additional specialist insurance products for those in the retail industry. If you run a shop, whether online or in a physical location, then your additional needs can be catered for by insurers.</p>\n<p>Specialised retail insurance includes:</p>\n<h3>Tenants Improvement Insurance</h3>\n<p>Any installed furniture and equipment that you have installed into your shop will not be covered under the landlord’s building insurance. Shelving, refrigeration equipment, lighting and air conditioning, for example, should all be insured directly through tenant’s improvement insurance.</p>\n<p>Note that this is in addition to your own contents insurance and covers items that become fixtures in the property rather than moveable assets.</p>\n<h3>Online Stock Insurance</h3>\n<p>Running a shop online requires you to holdstock. Specialist online stock insurance exists to bring premiums down and make sure you have the right level of cover that is tailored to your business. As stock is often changing, it requires a comprehensive bespoke cover from the insurer and you shouldn’t rely on something less specialised, such as contents insurance.</p>\n<h3>Life Insurance</h3>\n<p>Protecting your business is one side of insurance but protecting yourself and your family is another important part. Life insurance is a key product for you to make sure that those you leave behind are not left in financial difficulties. Like other insurance products, life insurance has multiple forms and choosing the right level of insurance based on your situation is important.</p>\n<p>Your age and health are key factors for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculating the cost of your life insurance</a> and for this reason, it is advisable to take out cover sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h3>Key Person Insurance</h3>\n<p>Sometimes called ‘key worker insurance’, this is a business subset of life insurance used when one or more employees of the business are critical to business continuity. Unlike a personal life insurance policy which is paid for by the individual with their family listed as the beneficiaries, key person insurance is paid for by the business, with the business receiving the full pay-out should death occur.</p>\n<p>Key person insurance is important in businesses where one or more members of the business would cause a significant financial downturn if they were to pass away.</p>\n<p>Typically, key person insurance is a level term life insurance variant, available only to businesses, though whole-of-life versions do exist.</p>\n<h3>Income Protection Insurance</h3>\n<p>Income protection (IP) insurance is a cover designed to provide you with an income if you find yourself temporarily unable to work through illness or, in some cases, redundancy.</p>\n<p>While income protection is useful for any employee who would struggle with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-pay/\">standard Statutory Sick Pay</a>, it is of particular interest to self-employed workers who would be left without any income at all should they become too ill to work.</p>\n<p>While income protection doesn’t offer a full salary replacement (often capped at 65%), its tax-free nature can mean it is more than suitable to see you through a difficult patch.</p>\n<p>If you are self-employed, consider income protection as part of your comprehensive business finance package.</p>\n<h3>Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance</h3>\n<p>Mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) is a subset of income protection that is designed to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mortgage-calculator/\">cover your mortgage payments</a> only, should you be unable to work. Its limited use means premiums are often cheaper than full income protection, and it is worth considering if your budget is tight.</p>\n<h3>Critical Illness Cover</h3>\n<p>Typically sold alongside life insurance, critical illness cover (CIC) pays out a lump sum if you suffer an illness or injury sufficient to prevent you from ever returning to work. Examples of situations that can be covered by CIC include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminal cancer;</li>\n<li>Full body paralysis;</li>\n<li>Multiple sclerosis;</li>\n<li>Heart attack; and</li>\n<li>Loss of limbs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Critical illness cover differs between insurance providers, each having their own specific list of conditions that are considered legitimate. Additionally, the criteria by which CIC is paid out can depend on your work and whether the injury sustained prevents you from continuing to earn.</p>\n<p>Critical illness payments can also help pay for private treatments to help you recover. They are typically large multiples of your annual salary, designed to help settle all your financial responsibilities and ensure a comfortable life.</p>\n<h3>Fee Protection Insurance</h3>\n<p>As accountants we also offer the specialised <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-fee-protection-insurance-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">fee protection insurance</a>. This is a level of business cover designed to ensure you are not left paying for additional <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">accountancy services</a> if your business is ever the subject of an investigation by HMRC.</p>\n<p>Without fee protection insurance, the cost of such an investigation &#8211; even if you have done nothing wrong &#8211; can be significant. This simple business insurance will make sure that any intervention by HMRC doesn’t come with unwanted fees.</p>\n<p>Speak to us at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> to get your fee protection insurance put in place.</p>\n<h2>Insurance and the Coronavirus</h2>\n<p>We appreciate even more than ever you need to be careful with all your spend. However, it could be a good opportunity to review what you have cover on and what you don&#8217;t. Like a lot of things in life, checking you have the right coverage and are paying the price for your insurance policies can remain at the bottom of your to do list throughout the year and is likely to only become more urgent if something happens and often, when things are too late.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 19.8pt 0cm 14.15pt 0cm;\">Support from Black and White Accounting</h3>\n<p>We work closely with Financial Planners and Insurance Brokers, who are part of our Strategic Partner team, to ensure you have the right amount of insurance to ensure you are getting value for money, but also so you can sleep at night.</p>\n<p>We want to make sure all of our clients are able to go about their business without worrying about any financial or legal issues.

      "content": "<p>Ah, the good old filing cabinet. From a childish perspective, these towering monoliths of metal formed the very essence of what it meant to be in ‘an office’; an unapproachable adult thing from a perplexing world.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Plus, there was always the threat that if you played with them you risked tipping them over and crushing yourself to death!</p>\n<p>The worry that a filing cabinet would crush you to death wasn’t just a childish fear &#8211; plenty of company directors and self-employed traders have to concern themselves with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-long-should-i-keep-my-business-records-for/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"126\">keeping business records</a>, and without guidance that responsibility can feel just as stressful as the fallen filing cabinet.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, in 2020 and beyond, records are very much digital.</p>\n<h2>A history of everything in your business</h2>\n<p>There are some rules, enforced by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs (&#8216;HMRC&#8217;), that govern how long you have to keep records on your company financial activities. In the days of paper-based accounting, holding on to everything for years could mean not just one filing cabinet, but an entire storeroom dedicated to archiving the history of your every transaction. Having a threshold of how long you had to keep your records was important, as there was a real-world physical implication of holding onto paper records for another year or two. In today’s world, such a consideration is rarely required. It is perfectly legitimate in 2020 to hold documentation digitally.</p>\n<p>Now we are in the era of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">digital tax returns</a>, holding documentation digitally isn’t even a choice &#8211; it’s essential.</p>\n<p>Unless you are archiving particularly dense material (high quality video, for example), the chances are that there really is no limit to the amount of records you can easily store. With that in mind, it’s always the best idea to keep everything you have. A good archiving and backup system, whether locally stored or via a cloud infrastructure, will ensure that you meet all required guidelines and mean that the heavy weight of compliance doesn’t weigh upon you.</p>\n<h2>Business records management for sole traders</h2>\n<p>The rules for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> are not quite as strict as those running a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>. Nonetheless, once you enter into business for yourself, you have an obligation to keep hold of all relevant financial paperwork as follows:</p>\n<p>Business records must be kept for at least five years from the date of the applicable tax return (31st January in the relevant tax year).</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>business expense receipts and invoices;\n<ul>\n<li>examples include <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/fuel-costs-calculator/\">fuel receipts</a>, invoices for computer equipment, third-party contractor invoices etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>sales documentation and invoices;\n<ul>\n<li>examples include copies of invoices provided to clients, merchant sales receipts, online shop data etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>personal income;\n<ul>\n<li>keep copies of bank statements stretching back a full five years for all accounts, or check these can be easily acquired when needed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>all money paid into the business;</li>\n<li>all money withdrawn from the business; and</li>\n<li>VAT documentation (if <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">VAT</a> registered).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Government grant information must be kept for at least four years following the date of receiving the grant.</p>\n<h2>Business records management for limited companies</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited company</a> records must be held for six years from the end of the accounting period. Company directors have a legal obligation to make sure these records are looked after and available upon request from HMRC.</p>\n<p>In addition to all the records that a self-employed sole trader business must retain (detailed above), a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> must also make sure the following is well documented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>full details of all business assets;\n<ul>\n<li>regularly inventory all products sold by the business</li>\n<li>non-sale assets from the office building (if owned) to the desks and other furniture must also be considered</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-loans-from-asset-finance-to-unsecured-loans/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"236\">loans or other finance linked with business</a> assets;\n<ul>\n<li>this can include mortgages, car finance and more</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>current business liabilities; and</li>\n<li>shareholder transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some documentation must be kept beyond the standard six years and remain accessible for ten years, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the company’s statutory books;</li>\n<li>board meeting minutes and resolutions; and</li>\n<li>VAT MOSS records (EU international <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">VAT</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Employers records</h2>\n<p>If you employ people through the Pay As You Earn (<a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">PAYE</a>) tax system, then you must maintain complete records for three years from the end of the relevant tax year. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tax codes;</li>\n<li>Payments made to HMRC;</li>\n<li>Salaries paid to employees;</li>\n<li>Full details of employee sickness and holiday;</li>\n<li>Taxable expenses; and</li>\n<li>Taxable benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Suitable record keeping options</h2>\n<p>While physical record keeping still falls within legal bounds, it is no longer the primary desired way to keep your business history, nor is it the most efficient.</p>\n<p>Digitising records has a huge advantage, not only in terms of storage space but also in terms of safety and security. Off-site backup solutions, including cloud storage and backup, means your records will remain intact even following a disastrous accident, such as a fire.</p>\n<p>Digitisation can be done in many ways and is often simpler than first thought. It is quite acceptable, for example, to take a photo of your fuel receipt with your smartphone and register the picture as the official record. If the pertinent details are fully readable in the photograph, it will be considered adequate.</p>\n<p>There are several software solutions available to help businesses maintain long term digital copies of their records, and many of the top accounting packages now include features to enable you to photograph and upload documentation for longevity.</p>\n<p>Remember that it is important for you to keep up to date with the digitisation of your documentation, and that mixed record keeping (half digital, half physical) will be frowned upon. Also ensure that your records are adequately protected for security.</p>\n<p>Many additional parts of your record keeping, such as your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">accounts</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">payroll</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax returns</a> etc. will already be developed in a purely digital medium, so the integration of additional digital records for other aspects of the business is both sensible and cost-effective.</p>\n<h2>Dealing with lost or stolen business records</h2>\n<p>If anything happens to your records which means they are temporarily or permanently lost, you should immediately contact HMRC who will do what they can to help; it may be that documents can be rebuilt, and accounts recalculated.</p>\n<p>Up to £3,000 in penalties can be enforced if you cannot produce records when you are asked to do so, so it is important that you do not let any loss of your company accounting records to go unreported.</p>\n<p>For this reason, multi-layered backup policies are an important part of your digital business strategy.</p>\n<h2>If an HMRC investigation occurs</h2>\n<p>Full transparency is the best policy if any of your records are requested by HMRC. It is important that you can provide the data they need without delay and in the most efficient form. All accountancy packages allow for the export of data in multiple formats, but secondary information may be more complicated to extract, so make sure you have full understanding of the technical aspects of your record keeping and are able to act without undue delay should anything be needed.</p>\n<p>If you do find yourself or your company the subject of an HMRC investigation, then you will need to retain all records until you are advised otherwise directly from HMRC, superseding any previous time limitations.</p>\n<h2>Overseeing your records at Black and White accounting</h2>\n<p>We can offer advice regarding your record keeping and the best digital solutions to ensure that you are able to get on with your business without the crushing worry of administration, let alone the costs, weighing down on you.

      "content": "<p>The Coronavirus outbreak in the UK and around the world has been really tough for all of us to watch over the last few months. Even if the virus has not affected you, your family, or your friends yet, we all harbour deep fears and rising anxiety about our loved ones who are members of vulnerable groups.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>How do you loosen the lockdown so that people can get back to their normal lives? (Whatever &#8216;normal&#8217; will be in the future, of course). Nothing is more sacred than human life, however, this absolute fact should not conceal from us the realisation that the economic hardships that millions of us will go through as a result of a deep and potentially prolonged recession is another and a very real form of human tragedy.</p>\n<p>Would you be a politician right now, with the kinds of decisions they have to make? According to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/10/historical-lessons-must-learn-save-economy/\">Telegraph</a>, HM Government will borrow more in the first four months of this year than it did in the 12 months of 2009 when the world was fighting the financial crisis, which led onto the Great Recession.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll consider the likelihood of the different types of recession we might face in the coming months and years.</p>\n<h2>A V shaped recession</h2>\n<p>Economists characterise the length of a recession and the recovery from it using letters – a V shaped recession is a period of negative growth followed quickly by a rapid bounce back in activity.</p>\n<p>Many feel that a V shaped recession is the likely outcome if the lockdown is lifted essentially in one fell swoop. The damages to personal and corporate finances would be limited to a few weeks’ revenues and offset by the various financial support schemes put in place by the government.</p>\n<p>Most of the debt-based support schemes do not require corporate borrowers to begin paying back their facility until well into 2021, at the earliest. This would give businesses enough time to get back to their previous levels of turnover and profitability and the impact of the additional fixed costs of repayments would be marginal (hopefully).</p>\n<p>In this scenario, as consumers, we would feel little or no constraint in spending money on holidays, luxuries, and non-essential purchases and our behaviours would barely be altered from how they were pre-COVID. Business decision makers would refocus on capital investment projects, growing market share, and taking on new members of staff.</p>\n<p>According to an Ernst Young survey on the 22<sup>nd</sup> March, 38% of company leaders expected a V shaped recession with activity returning to normal in Q3 (July, August, September) of 2020. However, in a more recent analysis, Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at <a href=\"https://www.schroders.com/en/uk/private-investor/insights/economics/economies-in-free-fall-as-hopes-fade-for-a-v-shaped-recovery/\">Schroders</a>, believes that hope is fading of a V shaped recession the longer this goes on for.</p>\n<h2>A U shaped recession</h2>\n<p>A U shaped recession is characterised by an economy stabilising but not growing for months or years from the level it sunk to following a slump. When the recovery does come, it’s fairly rapid and the economy grows back to and surpasses its pre-crash levels – the Great Recession was an example of this.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Great Recession may not be an ideal case study for the UK though. That’s because, despite the growth the economy enjoyed for years on end, gains in productivity, wages, and profitability were slow. 54% of the respondents to the Ernst Young survey expected a U-shape to the recession with the economy not recovering its losses until 2021.</p>\n<h2>An L shaped recession</h2>\n<p>An L shaped recession starts off with the same appearance as a U shaped recession, however, the economy bumps along at its post-crash level for a much greater duration and it only grows gradually in the months and years following that negative plateau.</p>\n<p>Just 8% of the Ernst Young respondents thought this would be the likeliest outcome believing that economic activity would not pick up until 2022 at the earliest. It would be interesting to find out what their thoughts are now halfway through May.</p>\n<h2>Which type of recession is it likely to be?</h2>\n<p>Given how nervous British people are about lifting the lockdown, it seems unlikely that, as described above in the V shaped scenario, consumers and business decision makers would behave in the way that they did pre-coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The severity and length of the recession seemingly depends on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how long lockdown goes on for;</li>\n<li>how “safe” we all feel;</li>\n<li>how insecure people and businesses are about the future financially; and</li>\n<li>how much cash they have left in the bank.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many businesses have very fine profit margins making it difficult for them to successfully endure a drop in revenue without having to lay too many employees off and without having to downsize their entire operation.</p>\n<p>Consider Rick Stein – the TV chef. He has built an impressive number of businesses in the last 30 years which, in the financial year to 2018, accumulated £16.8m in turnover between them. Hospitality margins are slender and, on this turnover, he made a pre-tax profit of £489,000 – barely 3% on which he would have had to pay 19% <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a>.</p>\n<p>Hospitality businesses benefit from being able to bank significant sums of customer money with an almost immediate settlement from credit card companies however they are hampered by very high fixed costs and costs of goods.</p>\n<p>Mr Stein has shown himself to be a very talented businessperson able to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/millionaire-calculator/\">make money in a highly competitive marketplace</a> but his business, like many others, can not cope with a disruption of even a few weeks of revenue. He courted, in the opinions of some, unfair criticism by telling his staff that the cash was not there to pay them and that they’d have to wait for the furlough scheme to come into operation.</p>\n<p>UK plc is facing a double whammy.</p>\n<p>First, the longer the disruption, the fewer cash consumers and businesses will have available to spend and invest. Second, the lack of a vaccine will likely change people’s behaviours as long as they perceive that there is a threat to them and their loved ones.</p>\n<p>If the lockdown is lifted three weeks from now and, concurrently, people’s confidence in their own good health and wellbeing is high, we might just get away with a U shaped recession.</p>\n<p>Any longer and we fear it’s going to be a long and bumpy road ahead for us all for a long time to come.</p>\n<h2>An Opportunity?</h2>\n<p>That said, every big event such as now creates opportunities. We can &#8216;reset&#8217; personally and professionally to make things better in our microeconomy thus impacting our macroeconomy overall.

We&#8217;d love to discuss this more with you.</p>\n<h2>Commercially-focused advice and support during the recovery</h2>\n<p>Each business is different and each business needs to approach this situation in its own way.

      "content": "<p>No one likes to think about their own passing, but not having a will can mean a long and complicated process for those you leave behind that often doesn’t work out the way you would prefer.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In the UK, dying without a will means your estate is subject to the rules of intestacy; a set of regulations that date back almost 100 years with very little change. Such is the nature of the intestacy rules that many modern family conditions are not recognised &#8211; stepchildren, for example, will find themselves left completely without the legal right to any of the estate.</p>\n<p>There are very few family situations where dying intestate is preferable. Writing a will is an important way to make sure that your wishes are known upon your death and enables those left to administer the estate to do so with confidence.</p>\n<h2>The rigid definitions of the intestacy rules</h2>\n<p>If you die without a will, the majority of your estate will pass to your spouse or civil partner and the remainder to your children and grandchildren. However, what this means can be unexpected for some.</p>\n<h3>Passing your estate to your ex-partner</h3>\n<p>The definition of terms can make things a little complicated. In the first instance, it is worth noting that only married partners and those joined by civil partnership have the legal right to inherit. This means that many people are overlooked despite having been lifelong partners.</p>\n<p>The other unwanted situation is when the estate (or a large chunk of it) is passed to an ex-partner because the marriage or civil partnership hasn’t been dissolved.</p>\n<h3>Treating your children as equals</h3>\n<p>One of the positive aspects of the intestacy rules for many people is that all children are treated equally; there’s no order of priority and anyone you are a blood parent of will get an equal share of the estate.</p>\n<p>Sadly, only those who are your children by blood or through a completed adoption are considered ‘children’ by the rules of intestacy; thus stepchildren or those part of a non-married blended family are left without any right to inherit.</p>\n<h2>The intestacy rules in brief</h2>\n<p>The rules themselves are quite simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is a spouse or civil partner and no children, they inherit the full estate and all chattels (the personal possessions not considered of financial value).</li>\n<li>If there is a spouse or civil partner and children, that partner will receive all chattels, the first £250,000 of value, and half of the remaining balance of the estate. The children will receive an equal share of the remainder of the estate.</li>\n<li>If there is no spouse or civil partner, then the children will receive an equal share of the estate.</li>\n<li>If any child has died, their children (the grandchildren) will receive their share, split evenly between them.</li>\n<li>If there is no spouse, no children and no grandchildren, then the estate is inherited by the next of kin in line; parents, siblings, other blood relatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s worth noting that all personal possessions go to the spouse, irrelevant of any sentimental value or wishes of other family members. This can mean that children or other relatives are denied even the smallest trinket that they hold dear.</p>\n<h2>Child guardianship &#8211; the sadly often unconsidered effect of dying without a will</h2>\n<p>A will doesn’t just determine what should happen with your wealth and worldly possessions, it also can help secure your children’s futures. Dying intestate means that no one knows your wishes when it comes to the guardianship of your children. In a stable two-parent family, the situation can often continue as normally as can be hoped for, with the remaining parent retaining full custody and residence for the children.</p>\n<p>When the family is more complicated however, dying intestate can have some serious consequences for your children, many of which you may not wish for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Children immediately become the custody of any other person with parental responsibility &#8211; this can include an ex-partner, even if they have been estranged from you and the children for many years.</li>\n<li>Step-parents do not automatically gain guardianship.</li>\n<li>Other family members (such as grandparents) do not gain guardianship.</li>\n<li>Any legal child arrangements orders to which you are a party become nullified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These factors can have a considerable impact on your children’s lives and cause lasting problems, especially during a time of immense grief for them.</p>\n<p>Writing a will enables you to set out your wishes for your children upon your death. While declaring that you would like someone to become a guardian after your passing does not make the situation legally binding, it will be taken strongly into consideration during any custody proceedings that follow.</p>\n<p>Secure your children’s futures with a professionally prepared last will and testament through <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>.</p>\n<h2>The unforeseen effects of intestacy</h2>\n<p>Dying intestate can have a large number of ramifications to those you leave behind. Not only are the rules rigid and unforgiving but administering the estate and getting everything put into order can be incredibly time-consuming.</p>\n<p>When you take the time to prepare your will, you naturally make sure to include any details that other family members might not know. This could include bank account <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individual-savings-account-isa/\">information for saving accounts</a> that you have kept or details on your life insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Many family members struggle to evaluate the full estate after an intestate death and a large portion of your finances could go permanently unclaimed.</p>\n<p>Working through an intestate estate can also take many months, and even years, putting those you leave behind in a state of financial difficulty while waiting for money to be unlocked and properly distributed. It can mean that property is sold against the will of those living in it, or that <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">inheritance tax</a> is more of a burden than it need be.</p>\n<p>Many people believe that they don’t need a will simply because they are happy for everything to be inherited by their spouse or civil partner, without thinking what would happen for the children and remaining family if they both died simultaneously. While accidents of this nature aren’t something anyone really wants to plan for, ignoring the possibility can have devastating impact.</p>\n<p>Writing a comprehensive will can solve all of these problems and lessen the burden for your grieving family.</p>\n<h2>Writing a will with Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Black and White are experts in making the right will to suit you.

Many people newer to running a business genuinely wonder why funders and investors seem so focused on cash flow when profit and turnover figures should be, in their minds and understandably, far more interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It’s only when you run a business for yourself when you truly appreciate the importance of the cash available to you to carry out your daily trading activities. And, other than matters of taxation, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/7-great-cash-flow-tips-seasonal-businesses/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"229\">business cash flow</a> is by far the topic of most frequently asked questions by our clients here at Black and White Accounting.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ve provided a taster of the advice we give to our own clients, which you can take into consideration when <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">managing your cash flow</a>. These tips include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focusing on costs initially</li>\n<li>Then focusing onto better revenue generation</li>\n<li>Being clear on what’s business&#8217; money, what’s your money, and what belongs to HMRC</li>\n<li>Building up a “Doomsday Fund”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to learn more, why not book a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">free hour’s consultation</a> with us today?</p>\n<h2>Focus on outgoings initially</h2>\n<p>It’s far easier to predict what’s leaving your account than what’s going to be coming in. In any business, there are three main types of cost – fixed costs, variable costs and exceptional costs.</p>\n<p>We’ll describe these costs below but when managing cash flow, please do not pay any invoice due until the very last possible moment agreed with the other party. That way, you keep money in your account for the longest possible time without breaking your word to your suppliers and the other people &amp; companies dependent on your business.</p>\n<p>One of the key things when reducing costs is to ensure the savings you make are not visible to your customers, to such an extent that they may choose to buy their products or services elsewhere as the quality of them deteriorate to such a degree that your competitors become preferable. The majority of costs, however, are not visible so there is often still a lot of opportunity. If you do need to cut-cost which are visible to your customers, try and help them understand why, to reduce the probability that they might be lost (unless of course, you want to lose them). Another thing you can look to do if you cannot reduce the costs themselves is to lengthen your payment terms for them or spread the costs for example by direct debit to improve business cash flow.</p>\n<h3>Fixed costs</h3>\n<p>Fixed costs refer to those costs which you must pay regardless of your volume of sales or your ability to collect income from clients. Your business&#8217; fixed costs are rent, business rates, professional services costs (accounting, HR, and so on), staff’s wages and so on.</p>\n<p>When revenue and profit are high, many business owners become distracted from what they might see as the “tedious” responsibility of cost control as they, for completely understandable reasons, chase additional revenue and profit. It’s much more fun chasing sales than it is going through a spreadsheet or cloud-based accountancy software.</p>\n<p>However, revenue goes up and down and, for the times when revenues are down, it’s better to enter “cash preservation” mode and then the tightening of the belt in a downturn. The truth is that businesses should be in permanent “cash preservation” mode but we understand that’s not always the reality.</p>\n<p>Make a list of all of the fixed costs of your business and decide which costs are justifiable and which ones are not. Where you cannot justify a cost, get rid of it (as long as you’re not breaking any contractual agreement with a supplier).</p>\n<p>If you decide that certain employees are surplus to requirements, you will face a short-term hit to lay them off (including redundancy if they have been with you for over two years) but, in following months, you will see the savings. With staffing discussions, we would recommend you include your HR Professional into the conversation. If you do not have one, we would be happy to recommend one of our strategic partners to you.</p>\n<h3>Variable costs</h3>\n<p>Variable costs in a business are linked to the supply of your products and services. You can preserve more cash in your business by spending less with your suppliers.</p>\n<p>If your business&#8217; account is a significant account to a supplier, you may wish to ask them for discounts based upon the achievement of monthly volume targets. You may wish to consider approaching other suppliers with the same or similar products to the ones you’re already buying to judge whether what you’re paying now is competitive or not.</p>\n<p>If you employ staff on commission, are the rates of commission you’re paying them too high? What do your competitors pay? Could you delay the payment of commission in case a customer who has been sold to backs out?</p>\n<p>If you were to scale back the percentage rate at which commission is paid or raise the target required to receive commission, how much push back would you get back from your staff? It’s inevitable that you would get some but would the negative feeling from staff really persist?</p>\n<h3>Exceptional costs</h3>\n<p>Exceptional costs are costs that you pay to, for example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>expand your business or increase its capacity; or</li>\n<li>you’re forced into paying.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Company expansion brings its own risks – especially increased future fixed costs. Increased fixed business costs mean that you’ve got to increase your revenue on a permanent basis to pay for the new staff, the bigger premises, and so on and it reduces your flexibility and how quickly you can evolve your business.</p>\n<p>Is investment in the growth of your business really an exceptional cost? Many accountants might disagree but we think it qualifies as one because it’s a decision that you take and part of that decision is choosing how much you want to grow and how much you want to spend on that growth. It is not a regular day-to-day cost, except in certain very niche industries.</p>\n<p>If you can, keep exceptional costs incurred in growth to a minimum by staging it rather than doing it in one big bang. By doing so, both the one-off costs and the associated increases in fixed costs are spread and more manageable.</p>\n<p>The exceptional costs you’re forced to pay may come from refunds, from legal action brought against you, and other unforeseen and unavoidable expenditure, or due to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-recovery-and-restructure-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">restructuring on your business</a>. There’s not much you can do about these except to provide your business with a buffer by building up your “Doomsday Fund” – more on that later.</p>\n<h2>Then focus on revenue generation</h2>\n<p>A very successful client of ours once told us that “a deal is a deal when the money is in the bank – any contracts signed or promises made are worthless until someone commits cash”. They are of course right.</p>\n<h3>Try to take money upfront</h3>\n<p>Many clients dislike taking money upfront, but please believe us when we say that you will be surprised, especially on smaller order values, how little resistance you get from a client when you ask for payment upfront.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s understandable that, on particularly complex, big-ticket, or multi-staged jobs, it may not always be possible to be paid for everything upfront. In these cases, ask to be paid upfront for the work involved in getting from one milestone to the next.</p>\n<p>Allowing someone to pay in 30, 60, or 90 days turns you into a banker as well as a businessperson. You don’t walk into Tesco, do your weekly shopping, and tell the checkout person that you’ll be back in 3 months’ time to pay.</p>\n<p>Please don’t put up with it – you’re better than that and your business is worth more.</p>\n<h3>Failing that, take a substantial deposit</h3>\n<p>If a client is reluctant to pay for everything upfront, insist on a significant deposit which at least covers your time and materials and allows you to make a small profit.</p>\n<p>You might ask for 50% upfront, 25% on completion of the product or service, and 25% when the customer signs off the job as complete. Again, you will be surprised by the lack of resistance from most customers to this suggestion. In fact, most of them will wonder why they’re not making the same requests of their customers.</p>\n<h3>Be on top of every invoice by investing in invoice software</h3>\n<p>As soon as work and payment terms are agreed, issue an invoice, especially if your client has agreed to pay you in advance or to pay you a substantial deposit. Get it out straight away and chase it up straight away. Shorter payment terms of say 7 or 14 days can also be helpful.</p>\n<p>If payment is not immediately forthcoming, remind your client in the nicest possible way what they have agreed to and that you can’t start work on their job until you’ve received what you’re owed. It&#8217;s not personal, but if a customer finds they don&#8217;t have to pay you within the agreed timescale, it is likely to lead to repeat behaviour in the future which could cause even bigger problems.</p>\n<p>If you are invoicing by milestone, make sure that the client is aware that payment is due on commencement of the work towards that milestone and not 30, 60, or 90 days after completion of the milestone.</p>\n<p>Make sure you regularly know which invoices are becoming due and which ones are overdue and take the appropriate action. Using cloud-based accounting software can make this infinitely easier. Using an app such as Chaser can also automate this.</p>\n<h3>As a business, accept debit and credit card payments</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.xero.com/blog/2018/01/improve-cash-flow-small-business-clients/\">Xero</a>, British companies issuing invoices for future payment will be paid on average 38 days later if only bank transfer and cheque options are offered.</p>\n<p>If you offer the option to pay by credit or debit card, that time drops to 19 days – half the time. Ask us about how you accept debit or credit cards when you get in touch.</p>\n<h3>Failing that, factor your invoices</h3>\n<p>Another option to bring in revenue faster is to factor your invoices. If you are unfamiliar with factoring, you are paid on the invoices you issue to clients almost immediately by the factoring company.</p>\n<p>You sell the value of the invoice to the factorer who initially pays you between 80-90% of the value of the invoice. When the customer pays up in full, you receive the balance minus the factorer’s fees. Factoring costs are similar to the costs of taking credit cards.</p>\n<p>There are dozens of factoring companies to choose from in the UK. When seeking one, try to find one which does not require you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sign a personal guarantee making you personally liable for debts uncollected if your business becomes insolvent and</li>\n<li>sell them all your invoices (it should be up to you which invoices you wish to sell and which ones you don’t).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an area of finance which is evolving quickly, thanks to challengers such as MarketFinance, making it a more attractive and potentially workable solution.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to do this, you can also use a debt collector or recovery company. However, you need to be careful not to damage your relationship with the customer in question.</p>\n<h2>Be clear what’s business&#8217; money, what’s your money, and what belongs to the HMRC</h2>\n<p>Always be careful to make sure that there is no confusion over which money belongs to you and which money belongs to your business, especially if you are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">running a limited company</a>. Some clients of ours have multiple business accounts each for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a>, CIS, PAYE, VAT, client funds etc. Don&#8217;t over-complicate this, but having more than one bank account can help keep things clearer in your head.</p>\n<p>Keep personal and business bank accounts separate and, when you want to pay yourself, make sure that you transfer money from your business account to your personal account.</p>\n<p>If you’re drawing a dividend, make sure that you complete the necessary paperwork and that you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">check that there is enough retained profit in the business</a> to take that money out. We can of course help with all of this.</p>\n<h2>Create an emergency &#8220;doomsday&#8221; fund</h2>\n<p>You should also set up a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individual-savings-account-isa/\">savings account</a> into which you transfer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% of the net profit you make every month for corporation tax if you run a limited company;</li>\n<li>30-55% of the net profit you make every month as a sole trader or a partner depending on the rate of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax</a> you pay; and/or</li>\n<li>15-20% of the value of each invoice if you’re VAT registered to make sure that you’re able to meet your VAT liability when due.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Try to work out how much running money you actually need a month and transfer the surplus into your business savings account – in an ideal world, you should only draw money down from your savings account when you need it and you should have three to six months of money to at least cover your fixed costs if everything goes wrong.</p>\n<h2>Help with cash flow from Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Although the suggestions in this article are generic, they can be applied to nearly every business.

      "content": "<p>At the end of 2017, cryptocurrencies, and in particular, Bitcoin, made headlines around the world as the price of a Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000.</p>\n<p>At time of writing, the price has more than halved from that high at just over $9,471, so sincere commiserations from us if you were tempted into cryptocurrency at the height of the market and you’ve been hoping for a return.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>But what if you made a fortune and got out at the right time? How will HMRC treat those gains?</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ve asked our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">UK tax experts</a> to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are;</li>\n<li>What HMRC have written about it and who has final say over a tax dispute involving cryptocurrency;</li>\n<li>Taxes on Bitcoins for the self-employed;</li>\n<li>Taxes on Bitcoins for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">private limited companies;</a></li>\n<li>Taxes on Bitcoins for private amateur investors; and</li>\n<li>VAT and Bitcoins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>\n<p>A Bitcoin is an electronic token which has monetary value. This is referred to as a “cryptocurrency”.</p>\n<p>However, these cryptocurrencies differ from traditional currencies in many ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They aren’t regulated by a central bank;</li>\n<li>They also aren’t regulated by a government;</li>\n<li>There is no physical representation of a cryptocurrency, such as notes or coins; and</li>\n<li>They are not universally accepted as a means of exchange.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traditional currencies are created by governments, central banks, and private banks. This means there is no upper limit to how much of a currency can exist.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is different &#8211; there can only be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins created. The system has been intentionally designed this way.</p>\n<p>How are Bitcoins created? “Miners” use a computer to solve a complex series of mathematical hash equations. Once a miner completes one of the series of equations, the “miner” is awarded with a Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Periodically during a Halving event, miners receive 50% fewer Bitcoin for the same amount of effort. The purpose of this is to restrict supply thus increasing the demand and price of the Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>HMRC and Bitcoins: What they have written about it and who has final say over a tax dispute involving cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>It is important to state from the off that there is no settled interpretation at the moment, on the treatment of crypto-derived profits.</p>\n<p>There is some guidance in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-brief-9-2014-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/revenue-and-customs-brief-9-2014-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies\">Revenue and Customs Brief 9</a> but some argue that it’s open to interpretation because similar catastrophic losses can be made in cryptocurrency that can be made in horse racing (either betting or casual ownership), so there is some question as to why it isn&#8217;t treated like gambling proceeds.</p>\n<p>When there is a dispute between a taxpayer (or taxpaying organisation like a limited company) and HMRC, these disputes are then decided by a body called the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT). FTT decisions are, on most occasions, treated as “case law” – what that means is that FTT judges will use a previous FTT’s judge’s decision as guidance. It is possible to appeal against an FTT judgement but that’s not really important for the purposes of this article so we’ll leave it for a later one.</p>\n<p>With no case law to go on, the best thing to do in most cases, and the safest, is to take HMRC’s least favourable scenario (to you) on a particular area of taxation and apply that to your situation. If you achieve anything more favourable than that, then consider it a bonus.</p>\n<p>We would not be surprised to see some challenges in this area, but here we present the best current understanding of this.</p>\n<h2>About Bitcoin Tax</h2>\n<p>Bitcoins themselves are not subject to taxation. They are only taxed once they are converted into Sterling, Euros, Dollars and so on.</p>\n<p>Once those Bitcoins have been sold and converted into traditional currency, the amount of tax you will pay on it is dependent on your line of business and whether you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-employed</li>\n<li>The owner of a private limited company</li>\n<li>An investor</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Taxes on Bitcoins for self-employed miners</h3>\n<p>If you are a self-employed Bitcoin miner, then you will <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">pay National Insurance</a> and Income tax on your profits. For the sake of simplicity, in the following example, we are only going to consider the electricity costs that you must pay, and the profit that you make.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you have mined £1,000,000 worth of Bitcoin, and you have spent £400,000 on electricity in the process, then you have made £600,000 in profit.</p>\n<p>On that £600,000 you would pay: £255,000 in Income Tax, £14,645 in Class 4 National Insurance, and £158.60 in Class 2 National Insurance.</p>\n<p>This would leave you with £330,196,40 after tax.</p>\n<h3>Taxes on Bitcoins for private limited companies</h3>\n<p>If you own a limited company which mines Bitcoins, then instead of Income Tax and National Insurance, you will have to pay Corporation Tax on the £600,000 you had made.</p>\n<p>Applying the standard Corporation Tax rate of 19% leaves you with £486,000 (paying £114,000 in taxes).</p>\n<h3>Taxes on Bitcoins for private amateur investors</h3>\n<p>If you are a private amateur investor and you had put a small amount of money into Bitcoin many years ago, the tax you pay on your profits will be as a Capital Gains Tax.</p>\n<p>Say you put £500 into bitcoin 10 years ago and now it is worth £1,000,000. This would make the profit from that transaction £999,500.</p>\n<p>To work out the Capital Gains tax, take your profit and subtract £12,300 from it (£12,300 is your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Ftax-rates-and-allowances%2Fcapital-gains-tax\">annual tax-free Capital Gains Allowance</a> in the current tax year).</p>\n<p>Assuming you made no other income that year, you would pay 10% on the first £50,000, and 20% on the remaining £950,000.</p>\n<p>This would result in a Capital Gains Tax bill of £195,000, leaving you with £804,500 post-tax profit.</p>\n<h2>VAT and Bitcoins</h2>\n<p>There is no VAT payable or chargeable when you buy, sell, exchange, or transfer Bitcoins.</p>\n<p>If you’re a miner, you can choose to claim back the VAT on the electricity bill and other VATable expenses you had accumulated when you were mining for coins, but only if you’re VAT registered.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoins and you</h2>\n<p>Will Bitcoins become the currency of the future? Will we really see central banks and the authorities surrender control of currency to third-parties? Is crypto really a hedge against unlimited money-printing by governments and what some consider to be their &#8216;control&#8217;?</p>\n<p>These are all questions for the future. We have no opinion either way but never rule anything out – remember that, back in February 2011, Bitcoin was at parity with the US Dollar and even now, much down from its peak, Bitcoin is worth nearly $10,000.</p>\n<p>To talk with us about <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">Accounts &amp; Tax</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">Book Keeping &amp; Payroll</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Business Planning</a> and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-apps-bookkeeping-software-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Software Training</a> services, please call us free on 0800 140 4644, or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">email</a>.</p>\n",

For many working parents and pawrents, it has never been so hard to navigate through a working day.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we have provided 12 tips for parents and pet owners to help maintain happiness and productivity.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2><strong>Children &amp; Pets</strong></h2>\n<p>Whether you are working from home with a dog, cat or a child, a number of our tips are applicable to children of the human and fur variety.</p>\n<h3><strong>Maintain the usual routine as much as possible</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to the impactful nature of the Coronavirus outbreak, it is very easy for your child and/or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/is-your-best-friend-tax-deductible/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"208\">pet’s</a> routine to become derailed. However, where possible, we recommend that you stick with your usual routine to maintain some normality, or at least create a new routine for all of your sanity.</p>\n<p>Breaking a routine can be particularly difficult for younger children and animals, resulting in stress and unwelcome behaviour. The last thing you want is for this to happen during an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-services/the-best-meeting-room-hire-in-surrey-hampshire/\">important meeting</a> or on a day where there are important deadlines to be met.</p>\n<h3><strong>Locate your desk where you can work and supervise</strong></h3>\n<p>As discussed in our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/5-top-tips-for-effective-remote-working-from-self-care-to-maintaining-productivity/\">remote working tips</a>, setting up a workspace away from areas of relaxation is important. However, if you have young children or a mischievous four-legged friend, hiding away in your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/use-of-home-as-office-rules-and-myths/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"127\">home office</a> may not be practical (unless you are working from home with a baby, of course!).</p>\n<p>To maintain self-discipline and prevent work worries from forming, continue to steer away from the sofa and set yourself up in the dining room, kitchen or in a hallway where you can keep an eye on what everyone is up to and ensure that they are keeping safe and well.</p>\n<h3><strong>Where necessary, speak to your employer about increasing flexibility</strong></h3>\n<p>Depending on your situation and home, remote working with children and pets can bring up challenges during the working day which just cannot be resolved or resolved easily. If this is the case, it is important to reach out to your employer about flexible working arrangements. Most employers will not mind how work is done, as long as it gets done.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, employers are likely to want to be as supportive as they can be, so don’t be afraid to be open and honest about your situation and how you are feeling. If you don’t speak to employer or HR about your difficulties, you may be harbouring unnecessary stress and anxiety which is no good for productivity and could erode your relationship and communication.</p>\n<h3><strong>Maintain communication with family and friends</strong></h3>\n<p>With the limitations of where and what you can do, it is natural for a person to feel lonely or too confined. Maintaining strong communication with your family and friends is important for keeping morale high, enhancing positivity and enables the opportunity to confide in others and discuss common issues.</p>\n<p>With children currently unable to go back to school, many parents are finding balancing homeschooling with working tough. So why not touch base with friends who are in the same situation, have a nice catch-up and share any useful tips on juggling work and educating a child? One thing is for sure, you are not alone.</p>\n<h3><strong>Avoid snacking </strong></h3>\n<p>With the ease of access to the kitchen, it is quite easy for snacking to become an issue when home working. If you are going to snack or you are going to treat your child or animal to a snack, make sure that you are not doing this too frequently or unhealthily.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ensure everyone is getting enough exercise </strong></h3>\n<p>With the recent good weather and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thebodycoach1/videos?app=desktop\">Joe Wicks’ P.E. lessons</a>, there are fewer excuses for not exercising daily (although we will always find excuses). Whilst exercise is beneficial for physical health, the endorphins released through exercising are great for enhancing mental wellbeing. With life&#8217;s current limitations, maintaining happiness is more difficult and important than ever. So, where you are taking the dog out for a walk, going for a run or doing yoga in front of the TV, try to incorporate a minimum of 30 minutes of physical activity into your daily routine.</p>\n<h2><strong>Children</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong> Set clear boundaries and rules </strong></h3>\n<p>When working from home, it is important to set out clear boundaries and rules for your older children to allow you to focus as much as possible. Also, make sure you let those in your household know at what times you absolutely cannot be disturbed due to an internal meeting or an external call. Transparency is key and this will also help you keep on the right track.</p>\n<h3><strong>Plan your children’s play and learning time </strong></h3>\n<p>Planning your child’s day like it was your own is important to establishing balance and peace whilst you work. Every evening (or even every weekend), pre-plan what your child will be doing for the day or coming week like you would your own work day. If there is a plan in place, you will be able to ensure your children hit their daily learning and play goals, keeping them happy and emotionally satisfied.</p>\n<h3><strong>Support your child if they have concerns about Coronavirus </strong></h3>\n<p>In the current circumstances, where we have all had to change the way we live and what we do, it is understandable for children to feel anxious and worried about the future. If your child is in this situation and you need some tips on how to best broach this topic with them, <a href=\"https://youngminds.org.uk/find-help/for-parents/supporting-your-child-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">Young Minds</a> have provided some fantastic guidance.</p>\n<h2><strong>Pets </strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Allow time for play and cuddles</strong></h3>\n<p>Like with children, it is important to key your pets occupied to prevent boredom and unwelcome behaviours. Depending on your animal’s age, needs and temperament, there are different things you can do: make sure their toy box is accessible, go on a lunchtime walk or take a few minutes out for some playtime or snuggles. During this difficult time, having an animal is proving to be therapeutic; helping owners to maintain sanity and a smile. With this in mind, it is even more important to dedicate quality time to your fur friend. For young pets, this is a great opportunity to build a strong bond which will last for years to come.</p>\n<h3><strong>Schedule toilet breaks </strong></h3>\n<p>For puppies and older dogs alike, it is important that you allow time during the day to let them out for a bathroom break. For many, this is as simple as opening the back door, however, not everyone has the luxury of a garden. For those who live in flats or do not have an enclosed garden, it is vital that you pay attention to the signs and take your four-legged friend out regularly between meetings and calls to avoid disruption.</p>\n<h2><strong>Struggling with your mental health during COVID-19? </strong></h2>\n<p>Are you finding it difficult to cope in these unprecedented times? Speaking to someone about your problems can take a big weight off of your shoulders.</p>\n<p>To speak to someone in confidence, you can <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/\">contact the Samaritans</a> on 116 123 or <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/\">Mind </a>on 0300 123 3393.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>This is a difficult time for everyone and we must come together to get through this.

Will they be numerous?</li>\n<li>Is telephone banking important?</li>\n<li>Should your bank be able to connect to your accounting software?</li>\n<li>What online facilities do they have?</li>\n<li>Will you need to manage transactions in foreign currencies?</li>\n<li>Do you need <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">additional services</a> such as invoicing, payroll and credit checks?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your business will hopefully grow and evolve over time so when considering your business account think about both your current needs and what you want in the future so that your business account becomes a business asset. Believe us, it isn’t an easy process to change your bank account and bank details, with customers taking time to update your details on their system; you don’t want to do this unless you have to.</p>\n<h2><strong>What should you be aware of when opening a business bank account?</strong></h2>\n<p>Along with services that banks provide, you should also consider the charges they may incur, together with any other costs, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly account fees, including those after free periods of banking</li>\n<li>Transaction charges</li>\n<li>Overdraft costs</li>\n<li>Cost of international payments</li>\n<li>Minimum balance requirements</li>\n<li>Interest rates, looking for the best return</li>\n<li>Account perks such as gift cards or lower insurance rates. Do you really need these?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Have you considered all the options? </strong></h2>\n<p>Banking is changing, following regulators’ moves to bring more competition to the sector and the boom in fintech which has introduced new online-only banking platforms, so there are choices beyond the High Street banks, AKA the Challenger Banks. For example, <a href=\"https://countingup.com/\">CountingUp</a>, <a href=\"https://monzo.com/\">Monzo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/\">Revolut</a>, <a href=\"https://www.starlingbank.com/\">Starling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tide.co/\">Tide</a> are used by our clients and there are many <a href=\"https://fintechnews.ch/london/digital-first-challenger-banks-uk/31886/\">other choices</a>.</p>\n<p>Online banks tend to have lower overhead costs and can offer cheaper fees and better interest rates. Also, being 100% focused on their online offering, you will find these banks slick and efficient, offering a breadth of online functionality making transactions and tracking your finances incredibly easy, they are not held back by archaic and colossal architecture and infrastructure which may no longer be fit for purpose. Starting with a blank sheet of paper does have it’s advantages when it comes to meeting customers current and future needs.</p>\n<p>Despite this, only 26% of Small and Medium Enterprises (‘SMEs’) would go to a ‘digital-only’ alternative, even if it were cheaper, according to an <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-103/Accenture-UK-SME-Banking-Survey.pdf#zoom=50\">Accenture survey</a>, partly due to security concerns. However, customers are steadily becoming more comfortable with online banking and this is reinforced by the fact that the traditional banks themselves are racing to enhance their online offerings to complete with online challengers. Whilst they are innovative however, some of these accounts are in ‘beta’ testing, for example not having the ability to make transfers abroad, only providing personal/business banking, but not necessarily both yet. This might have put off other potential customers, until these are addressed.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do I choose a bank account?</strong></h2>\n<p>Shop around; it’s worth considering both the high street and online banking options and taking time to compare their offerings against your list of what you need from a bank account.</p>\n<p>Starting a business account is important. Apart from avoiding possible problems with HMRC by clearly separating personal and business expenses and transactions, a business bank account with great functionality can help you take control of your finances.</p>\n<p>Whilst innovation is improving the sector, banking for start-ups and Small and Medium sized enterprises in the UK is not best in class. The three simple things we’d look at in deciding currently would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What functionality do you require both now and in the future?;</li>\n<li>Who offers the longest interest/charge-free period; and/or</li>\n<li>Who do you already have an existing relationship with. You’d be surprised, it isn’t always easy to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-future-is-here-open-banking/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"56\">open a business bank</a> account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Specialists in business support: Black and White Accounting</strong></h2>\n<p>If you would like to discuss business banking or any other business challenges you face and how they may impact on your finances in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/top-5-sme-challenges-in-2020/\">2020</a>, our specialist team can help you, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>In light of the Coronavirus outbreak, the UK government has created many schemes to aid employees and businesses alike. From the Job Retention Scheme to business support grants, they are doing all that they can to help as much as possible during these unprecedented times. However, there are some people who have not met the criteria in order to be eligible for the schemes. In these times of uncertainty and for some, panic, it is highly likely that people have gone to fraudulent lengths in order to gain entitlement.</p>\n<p>In this post, we are going to discuss the differences between <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountant-tax-evasion-duty-blow-whistle/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"219\">tax evasion</a> and tax avoidance (and tax efficiency), and more generally, tax fraud.</p>\n<h2>What is tax fraud?</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> or business commits tax fraud when they deliberately falsify information on a tax return to reduce tax liability; essentially cheating the system in an attempt to avoid paying the full tax amount due. Tax fraud can also be committed by exaggerating expenses and allowances to the claimant&#8217;s benefit.</p>\n<h2>What are the differences between tax evasion and tax avoidance?</h2>\n<p>The difference between evasion and avoidance is down to legality, and there is a very fine line between the two.</p>\n<p>Tax evasion is a type of tax fraud whereby income or information is concealed from HMRC, whereas, tax avoidance is where <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">individuals</a> and businesses identify grey areas in tax laws and find ways of reducing taxable income or tax owed. When you drill down further into what these two things are, each one is defined by intent; with tax evasion involving purposely lying and tax avoidance, hiding.</p>\n<p>In 2017, a list of 100 celebrities was obtained from Companies House highlighting those who had invested at least £100,000 into a film financing scheme. Since the exposure of celebrity involvement with tax relief schemes like this one &#8211; which resulted in a total tax relief of £700 million &#8211; those who are shortlisted for knighthoods and other honours can now be blocked from nomination, due to poor tax affairs.</p>\n<p>Tax avoidance is the legal use of the tax regime to reduce the amount of tax that you pay, within the law. Similarly, tax efficiency, us when an individual or business pays the least amount of tax they are required to, within the law.</p>\n<h2>HMRC tax evasion and examples</h2>\n<p>Misunderstood something on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your tax returns</a> and made an error? Don’t worry, HMRC will not think you are a tax evader. However, if you have consciously left out information or supplied incorrect information, this is what you will be classed as.</p>\n<p>Common examples of UK tax evasion include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failing to report income to HMRC;</li>\n<li>Under-reporting income to HMRC;</li>\n<li>Hiding money, shares or other assets in an off-shore bank account;</li>\n<li>Misreporting personal expenses as tax-deductible business expenses; and/or</li>\n<li>Using company property for personal use without a valid reason</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HMRC tax avoidance and examples</h2>\n<p>In contrast, tax avoidance, as mentioned above, is when individuals or companies make a conscious decision to exploit the tax system to reduce tax liabilities. There are however &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; ways to do this, with the former being within the spirit of the UK law and that latter being outside.</p>\n<p>Good tax avoidance, can include, but not be limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Putting money into an ISA (Individual Savings Account) to avoid <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">paying income tax</a> on interest earned by cash savings;</li>\n<li>Giving employees company shares;</li>\n<li>Making charitable donations;</li>\n<li>Investing in a pension scheme; and/or</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">Claiming capital allowances</a> for business purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are firmly within both the law itself and the spirit of the law. These are legitimate ways to reduce your tax, which the Government encourages.</p>\n<p>Bad tax avoidance, can include, but not be limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tax havens without legitimate economic/commercial purpose;</li>\n<li>Playing one task system off against another;</li>\n<li>Complex arrangements without legitimate economic/commercial purpose; and/or</li>\n<li>Artificial arrangements without legitimate economic/commercial purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deciding what side you fall upon doesn&#8217;t just depend on the law, it also depends on the spirit of the law also.</p>\n<h2>Penalties for tax evasion in the UK</h2>\n<p>The penalties for UK tax evasion vary on a case-by-case basis, however, evaders can receive a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine. Providing HMRC with false documentation can result in a 6 month prison sentence or a fine of up to £20,000.</p>\n<p>Every year, HMRC prosecutes around 1,000 taxpayers, with those who are responsible for the most serious cases of tax fraud or evasion prioritised. That said, they are looking to increase their criminal investigation resources on an ongoing basis to be able to make more discoveries. Therefore, if you feel that there are irregularities in your accounts, you should disclose these to HMRC before they take legal action against you (known as an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-your-guide-to-making-a-disclosure/your-guide-to-making-a-disclosure\">HMRC Disclosure</a>). This will enable you to submit a disclosure to bring your tax affairs up-to-date.</p>\n<h2>The cost of tax evasion for the UK Government</h2>\n<p>In the 2017 tax year, HMRC estimated that the bill for tax evasion was in excess of £5 billion. Due to the amount of applications made for the different schemes during the Coronavirus outbreak, we would expect <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-hmrc-checks-and-enquiries-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">HMRC checks and enquiries</a> to increase post-crisis, leading to more tax evasion penalties being issued than usual.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Whilst we don&#8217;t want our clients to pay more tax than they need to, it is also important to pay the tax which is due and we work closely with our clients to ensure they do this. There are however many &#8216;grey&#8217; areas, and whilst tax efficiency is key, we must consider both the law itself as well as the spirt of the law for our clients.</p>\n<p>To find out more about this and ensuring you remain on the right side of the law, without paying more tax than you need to, please call us today on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">click here to email us</a>.</p>\n",

It aims to relax the burden on businesses during the coronavirus outbreak, providing additional flexibility and allowing corporate bodies to focus on their operations in these unprecedented circumstances.</p>\n<p>We provide more information of this below, with the key focus on the changes to filing deadlines and how they affect UK <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">companies </a>and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-liability-partnership-services/\">LLPs</a>.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>The Act</h2>\n<p>The key components include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporarily suspends elements of insolvency law;</li>\n<li>Adds new <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-recovery-and-restructure-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">corporate restructuring</a> facilities to the existing insolvency regime; and</li>\n<li>Temporarily relaxes a number of requirements related to Annual General Meetings (&#8216;AGMs&#8217;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secondary legislation gives effect to a number of measures, particularly related to the relaxation of standard filing deadlines for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/companies-house-forms/\">documents that must be submitted to Companies House</a>. These regulations will expire at the end of 5 April 2021.</p>\n<h2>Companies House filing deadlines</h2>\n<p>The extension in deadlines is automatic and there is no need to apply for the extensions. Companies House has automatically been updated to reflect these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accounts &#8211; ordinarily there are nine months from the end of the relevant accounting period to file their accounts, which has been temporarily extended now to twelve months;</li>\n<li>Confirmation statements &#8211; these are normally submitted within 14 days from the end of the confirmation period. This has been temporarily extended to 42 days;</li>\n<li>Event-driven events &#8211; including change in registered offices, Single Alternative Inspection Location (&#8216;SAIL&#8217;), appointment of new officers, reportable changes to officer details, termination of appointments and changes in People With Significant Control (&#8216;PSC&#8217;), have also been temporarily extended to 42 days; and</li>\n<li>Mortgages or charges &#8211; the standard deadline of 21 days has been temporarily extended by 10 days to 31 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Good new, but&#8230;</h2>\n<p>Some practical considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although the Companies House deadlines have been extended, HMRC deadlines have not been extended at this stage. We therefore encourage you to continue to do everything as soon as possible, especially as it is very easy to forget about these things when things are so tough. If you are comfortable with the standard timescales, there will rarely be harm in sticking to them.</li>\n<li>This is an extension of deadlines, not a removal of the requirement to file. It’s important to remember that companies and their directors can still face serious penalties for not filing by the (as amended) deadlines.</li>\n<li>As with any change, there is the potential for confusion. We are already aware, for example, of some emails going out incorrectly from Companies House where their systems are still to be updated. Be careful here, especially with the different extensions on different deadlines.</li>\n<li>They expire at the end of 5 April 2021. Deadlines will not be extended next year if they fall on or after 6 April 2021 (unless there are any further announcements) and this time will quickly pass.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>At this most difficult of times, we are doing everything we can to help and support as many people as possible, for example by keeping them up to date with all the latest news and support schemes as we have done here.

Particularly as the registration and de-registration thresholds change regularly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Registration</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The current registration threshold for VAT is £85,000. This means if your turnover for the previous 12 month period (on a rolling basis, not based on your financial year) exceeds £85,000 you must register for VAT. You must also register if you think your business will go over the threshold in the next 30 days.</p>\n<p>Registering for VAT is actually very easy and can be done online via the HMRC website. <a href=\"/contact-us/\">We can help</a> if you get stuck!</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Deregistration</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are VAT registered and your turnover falls below £79,000 within a 12 month period or you have good reason to believe it will do in the next 12 months, you can choose to cancel your VAT registration.</p>\n<p>Again, this is something that is very easy to do from the HMRC website. But, make sure you do not deregister prematurely as the penalties for failing to be registered for VAT are very severe.</p>\n<p>It is also worth <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">checking whether your business is better off</a> being VAT registered or not. If you aren’t sure, book a meeting with us to discuss how VAT registration will impact your business.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> VAT Schemes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are several VAT schemes designed to reduce the administration burden on small businesses by simplifying the process of producing and filing quarterly VAT returns.</p>\n<p>The most common scheme to be used by small business is the flat rate scheme, which is available to businesses with an estimated turnover of under £150,000 excluding VAT (or £191,500 including VAT). This scheme enables you to apply a percentage to your VAT inclusive turnover to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculate your quarterly payment</a> to HMRC. You must leave the scheme once your annual turnover exceeds £230,000.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">VAT is a notoriously complex area of tax</a> legislation and the penalties for getting it wrong are pretty harsh. So if you are in any way unsure, or would like to receive specific advice for your business, please do get in touch on 0800 140 4644 or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">email</a>.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Justifying and claiming expenses</h2>\n<p>HMRC in one form or another has been around for more than 160 years and in that time they must have seen every sort of business expense claim under the sun!</p>\n<p>It’s all been tried before, whether it was a railway magnate claiming that his top hat counted as working wear or a ship’s captain insisting his ship couldn’t sail without a full hold of rum to keep his crew happy.</p>\n<p>The advent of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax return</a> forms gave the general public full rein to use their imaginations to reduce their tax bill and some self-employed business people have stretched the definition of expenses a little too far, instead of checking with their accountant first.</p>\n<p>Here’s our most unusual self-employed business expense claims that didn’t make the cut:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A daughter’s wedding for more than £10,000 was recorded under “sundry expenses”</li>\n<li>Someone put their dating website subscription through the business account (risky business?)</li>\n<li>A holiday to the Seychelles (travel and subsistence)</li>\n<li>Home renovation (repairs and renewals)</li>\n<li>A claim for a Brazilian wax (ironically filed under clothing expenses!)</li>\n<li>New dining room furniture was for a ‘Boardroom’ (Furniture expenses)</li>\n<li>Herbal Viagra substitute was included in a claim that took a couple to Barbados (Travel and subsistence)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Navigating the world of business expense claims can be difficult, so it&#8217;s advisable to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">consult with a self-assessment accountant</a> to ensure that your deductions align with the regulations and won&#8217;t raise eyebrows at HMRC.</p>\n<p><strong>Be realistic about business expenses</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, some self-employed business people seem to get a little confused about what a legitimate expense is, even though HMRC offers plenty of guidance online.</p>\n<p>Some business expense categories are pretty self-evident; tools of the trade; building materials, stationery or marketing for your company.</p>\n<h3><strong>Keeping track of expenses</strong></h3>\n<p>Other expenses are harder to keep a track of unless you’re well organised (or make use of a dedicated <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">book keeping service</a>), like working out the proportion of your phone bill or car mileage can be attributed to business rather than home life.</p>\n<p>However, expenses involving food or clothing are particularly problematic. The general rule of thumb that we apply at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> is that an expense must be “wholly and exclusively” for business purposes.</p>\n<p>So, if you are claiming for food and drink, it should be as a travel expense and must be outside your normal working routine. Travelling to and from your office every day, or buying a sandwich for lunch at your desk don’t count, but a journey to a potential client to deliver a sales pitch would be acceptable.</p>\n<p>Even barristers have fallen foul of the law when it comes to clothing. If it’s personal protective equipment (steel-toed boots, overalls) or it’s emblazoned with your company logo, you’re probably OK. However, a new suit for the office could just as easily be used for a wedding or a party; it would be impossible to prove that it’s “wholly and exclusively” for business purposes.</p>\n<h2>Keeping track of tax documents</h2>\n<p>It is a legal requirement to keep records that support a tax or VAT return. HMRC want to see that your figures add up and make sure you are paying the correct amount of tax. Without accurate record keeping you could face penalties for inadequate records (or for not keeping them for the required period of time), and this may also result in penalties for an incorrect tax return – without up-to-date records it becomes increasingly difficult to file an accurate return.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom, good record keeping works for your business too; allowing you to manage cash flow, keep track of expenses, chase money owed and pay the right amount of tax, not too much!</p>\n<h3>How Long Do You Need To Keep Records?</h3>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most popular questions I get asked is “how long do you need to keep records?” Fortunately, the days of storing shoeboxes full of receipts are long gone for many businesses: computer software means that most records can be stored securely on a local disk or in the Cloud, and there are lots of apps available for keeping track of your expense receipts. Incidentally, in most cases, HMRC accepted scanned copies of receipts (or photos), just remember to scan or snap both sides of the receipt.</p>\n<p>However, even though you don’t have to keep paper records, it’s helpful to know that in most cases you must keep records for 6 years. There are exceptions, for example a contractor in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">Construction Industry Scheme</a> (CIS) need only keep PAYE records for 3 years, while if you own a limited company the Companies Act may compel you to keep certain records for different periods of time. If in doubt, check with your accountant!</p>\n<h3>Essential Record Keeping</h3>\n<p>Below is an outline of the essential records you need to keep whether you are self-employed, in a business partnership, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>, an employer, or a combination of these.

The best advice is to get it done early, or get a professional to do it for you. But if you’re up against the clock, don’t make these common mistakes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Leaving Income Out</strong>: Many self-employed people also have income from other sources as well as their own business; perhaps you also have a salaried job, are in a partnership or have income from UK property. You’ll need to complete the relevant section to declare this income, these are called “supplementary pages”; help is available <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets\">here</a>. Don’t forget to also include any non-cash benefits an employer provides (such as medical insurance), and if you’ve been reimbursed for expenses incurred as part of a salaried job include these in boxes 17-18 of the “Employment” pages, so that you don’t pay extra tax on these.</li>\n<li><strong>Not Declaring Interest On Savings And Bank Accounts:</strong> HMRC want to know every single penny you have earned, including interest on personal savings or bank / building society accounts. If you have a joint account with your partner or spouse, you’ll need to declare your share of any interest. Also include interest from PPI compensation payouts. ISAs are tax-free so these are excluded.</li>\n<li><strong>Mixing Up Gross and Net</strong>: A common mistake when under pressure is to mix up your numbers and this can either result in you paying more or less tax than you should. Either way it’s an incorrect return that could mean a penalty. Check that you know <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-hmrc-checks-and-enquiries-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">what HMRC require when declaring income</a> (gross or net), and ensure that you understand what numbers in your accounts refer to.</li>\n<li><strong>Forgetting Unpaid Invoices and Costs</strong>: Unless you are using the cash basis for your accounts, you must also include any unpaid invoices and unpaid costs falling in the 2019/2020 tax year period. To help keep your accounts in order now’s the time to chase outstanding invoices, or declare bad debts, and account for costs incurred such as business mileage.</li>\n<li><strong>Not Declaring Gift Aid</strong>: This may not affect your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax</a> (unless a higher-rate taxpayer*), but it does impact on those charities you have supported over the tax year. For every donation of £1 gift aid is worth 25p to the charity. You’ll need to know exactly how much you have donated during the tax year so if you don’t have this information this time around, make sure you keep a record for future donations. *Higher-rate taxpayers can claim the difference between the higher and basic rate on each donation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Taxes on Properties</h2>\n<p>Companies that own properties may be liable to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/stamp-duty-and-land-tax/\">complete an ATED return</a>. To avoid fines ensure you are complying with HMRC and have your return completed correctly and on time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Who should complete an ATED return?</strong></h3>\n<p>Companies that own residential property in the UK valued over £500,000 should completed an ATED return. There are some exemptions, such as companies that own properties in their capacity as a trustee of a settlement.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is an Enveloped Dwelling?</strong></h3>\n<p>If a dwelling is owned by a company, a partnership with a corporate member or other collective investment vehicle then it is said to be enveloped because ownership is ‘enveloped’ within a corporate wrapper’.</p>\n<p>A dwelling is a property that is used, or can be used, as a residence or is suitable for use as a dwelling. There are nuances around what is considered a dwelling so it’s worth <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-ated-and-stamp-duty-land-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">understanding what comes under the scope of ATED</a> to avoid unnecessary tax.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is not considered a dwelling?</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to non-residential properties, other properties that fall out of the scope of ATED are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hotels</li>\n<li>Guest houses</li>\n<li>Boarding school accommodation</li>\n<li>Hospitals</li>\n<li>Student halls of residence</li>\n<li>Military accommodation</li>\n<li>Care homes</li>\n<li>Prisons</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How are properties valued?</strong></h3>\n<p>ATED charges are banded and depend on the value of the property. You can value the property yourself or it can be done by a professional who will base it on the open market willing buyer/willing seller principle. If you’ve only owned the dwelling, or it has only been a dwelling under the scope of ATED, for part of the year, ATED applies on a proportional basis.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can you get ATED relief?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are instances where you may be eligible for ATED relief, which includes but is not limited to the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let to a third party on a commercial basis and not occupied by anyone connected to the owner</li>\n<li>Open to the public for at least 28 days a year on a commercial basis</li>\n<li>Property developed for resale by a developer</li>\n<li>Used by employees of the company for company business where the employee has less than ten percent interest in the company</li>\n<li>Owned by a registered provider of social housing</li>\n<li>A farmhouse if it is occupied by a farm worker, their spouse or civil partner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think you are eligible for relief you can only claim by submitting a return or you may still be fined.</p>\n<h3><strong>When does an ATED return need to be submitted?</strong></h3>\n<p>As standard, an ATED period is 1 April to 31 March each year and the ATED return needs to be completed and any payment due made by 30 April each year. New properties that come within the scope of ATED must have a return submitted within 30 days.</p>\n<h2><strong>Help is at hand</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’re behind on your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> or struggling to work out what you need to pay and when, have a chat with the team at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White accounting</a>.

Next thing you need to tackle, the dreaded tax man. Your experience here will depend on the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">business structure</a> you decide.</p>\n<h3><strong><u>Limited Company Tax and National Insurance </u></strong></h3>\n<h4>Why a Limited Company?</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited companies</a> tend to be the preferred option for startups, as they allow you to keep your business finances separate from your personal earnings.</p>\n<p>For those individuals who want a more simplistic method of running their business, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">self-employment as a sole trader</a> is the alternative. However, there are key advantages to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">creating a limited company</a>, not least that you are likely to pay less tax than a sole trader.</p>\n<p>Limited companies pay <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporate Tax</a> on their profits. Currently small businesses (profits under £300,000) pay the ‘small profits rate’ at 20% and larger businesses the ‘main rate’, which is 19% for most businesses.</p>\n<p>If you are the director or shareholder of your limited company, you can choose to pay yourself a salary, pay yourself in dividends or a combination of both. Dividends are taxed separately and are not subject to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> Contributions (NIC). Therefore, this can reduce your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax liability</a> and overall save you and your company money; compared to the sole trader route.</p>\n<h4>Setting up Your Limited Company</h4>\n<p>If you decide a limited company is the best choice for you, the process is fairly easy and pain free!</p>\n<p>You can do this yourself or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">get an accountant</a> to do it for you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Register your company with </strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/register-a-company-online\"><strong>Companies House</strong></a><strong>:</strong> once registered you’ll receive a ‘Certificate of Incorporation’, confirming the company legally exists, the company number and date of formation.</li>\n<li><strong>Inform HMRC of your new company:</strong> you will then receive your Unique Tax Payer Reference.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your company for corporation tax:</strong> using your Unique Tax Payer Reference you must provide HMRC with specific information about your business within 3 months of starting up your company.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note that this is the basic procedure you need to go through, however there are various considerations when forming a limited company; directors, shareholders, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-services/the-best-companies-secretarial-and-company-formation-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">company secretary</a> etc. If you would like some advice on this, get in touch with our team.</p>\n<h4><strong>Your Tax Responsibilities</strong></h4>\n<p>Having set up your limited company, you have the following tax responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To put together annual statutory accounts.</li>\n<li>To send Companies House an annual return.</li>\n<li>To send HMRC an annual <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Company Tax Return</a>.</li>\n<li>To register for VAT if your company expects to take over £81,000 p/a.</li>\n<li><strong><strong>To pay your tax!</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a director of a limited company, you must also <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">file your own self-assessment tax return</a> for the salary and any dividends you draw: and pay tax and NIC through the PAYE system.</p>\n<p>Legally, you do not have to employ an accountant to do this, but it helps! There are penalties and fines for late and incorrect filings, and remember you are legally responsible for your company’s records, accounts and performance. If you would rather have peace of mind and concentrate your energies on your core business, delegating these onerous tasks to an expert is a good idea. For peace of mind and efficient handling of your tax obligations, considering the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">services of a self-assessment accountant</a> is a wise choice. They can navigate the complexities of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">filing self-assessment tax returns</a>, ensuring accuracy and timeliness while allowing you to focus on your core business activities.</p>\n<h3><strong><u>Self Employed / Sole Trader Tax and National Insurance</u></strong></h3>\n<p>If you are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">self-employed</a>, tax due must be paid by 31st January following the end of the tax year. For example, for the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"173\">tax year that ended</a> 5th April 2020, all tax and national insurance due would need to be paid by 31st January 2021.</p>\n<p>As a sole trader, your tax will be self-assessed, and you’ll need to take the following into consideration when <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculating how much you need to pay:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tax Free Income:</strong> Within the UK, you currently have £12,500 of tax except income. Make sure to take this into consideration when working out what you need to pay.</li>\n<li><strong>Same Rates:</strong> Sole traders pay the same tax rates as employees</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Income:</strong> Any income you receive as an addition to the business profits will need to be taxed separately.</li>\n<li><strong>National Insurance:</strong> There are different rules for both tax and national insurance for sole traders, it would be best to speak to a professional as the discrepancies can be difficult to distinguish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following table breaks down how much tax you will need to pay based on your income:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"200\"><strong>Tax Band</strong></td>\n<td width=\"200\"><strong>Taxable Income </strong></td>\n<td width=\"200\"><strong>Tax Rate </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"200\">Basic Rate</td>\n<td width=\"200\">£0 to £34,500</td>\n<td width=\"200\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"200\">Higher Rate</td>\n<td width=\"200\">£34,501 to £150,000</td>\n<td width=\"200\">40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"200\">Additional Rate</td>\n<td width=\"200\">Over £150,000</td>\n<td width=\"200\">45%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Start Up Legal Documents</h2>\n<p>Legal documentation is an essential element of your business’ foundation, alongside a professional accountant and comprehensive insurance.</p>\n<p>What legal documents are standard for a business? Which of them do you need and how do they help you?</p>\n<h3>Core Business Documents</h3>\n<p>The first set of business documents are the ones that deal with the business as an entity, forming the central core to the business.</p>\n<h4><strong>Shareholders Agreement or Partnership Agreement</strong></h4>\n<p>If you are building a business with someone else, it is imperative that you have a legal framework in place that dictates the essence of how your business is to be run.</p>\n<p>The Shareholders Agreement (for limited companies) or Partnership Agreement (for partnerships) is the main document that sets out the key tenets of the business to ensure that everyone involved in the decision-making processes has a full understanding of how the business works.</p>\n<p>It is with this agreement that you set out the terms by which you will work together, the responsibilities of each shareholder/partner, how decisions will be made, and how both profits and liabilities are shared.</p>\n<h4><strong>Privacy Policy for Website</strong></h4>\n<p>Almost every business has a website, and with that comes a set of regulations to ensure that you deal in a responsible way with visitor data. Under GDPR regulations, every website requires a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/privacy-policy/\">privacy policy</a> that clearly sets out what data you collect from website visitors, how that data is stored, how it is used, and what systems are in place to protect it.</p>\n<h4><strong>Website Terms of Use</strong></h4>\n<p>The ‘terms of use’ is an agreement that is mainly used for users that directly interact with the site, though log ins or financial transactions.</p>\n<p>The Website Terms of Use defines the legal relationship between your business as the website operator, and the end users of your website. Through an acceptance box, users acknowledge that they agree to abide by these terms, providing you with the necessary legal backing should there be any problems in the future.</p>\n<h3>Contracts</h3>\n<p>This second set of agreements covers interactions between the business and those who work for it, including employees, contractors and any third-party businesses who provide services.</p>\n<h4><strong>Employment Contract</strong></h4>\n<p>When expanding your business to include a team of employees, the employment contract ensures that you and your employee are both in full understanding of the terms of the employment relationship. It is a two-way document, detailing what is expected of the employee from the business, and also outlines the benefits to the employee as agreed by the business.</p>\n<p>It should cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A clear job title and description;</li>\n<li>Details of pay;</li>\n<li>Times of work;</li>\n<li>A full outline of any probationary period;</li>\n<li>Clear structure of holiday entitlement and pay;</li>\n<li>Business sickness policy and sick pay structure;</li>\n<li>Additional employee benefits (such as <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/company-car-and-fuel-benefit-in-kind/\">company car</a>, work laptop etc.);</li>\n<li>Pension information;</li>\n<li>Business structure rules (for example, uniform regulations etc.);</li>\n<li>Termination policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement (‘NDA’)</strong></h4>\n<p>Also called a Confidentiality Agreement, an NDA protects the business and its intellectual ideas throughout its lifetime; anyone who has signed an NDA is legally bound not to disclose your confidential information to anyone. It is often advisable to consider an NDA during the very early days of the business to keep any unique concepts quiet during the formation of the business, but it is also a key document when working with any new people to make sure project specifics are kept private.</p>\n<h4><strong>Non-Compete Agreements (‘NCA’)</strong></h4>\n<p>A NCA sets out terms by which you can protect your investment in staff, by preventing them from leaving your business and immediately working for a business in competition or setting up a rival business.</p>\n<p>It is usual to limit the terms of an NCA, such that it is for a set period (six months after leaving employment, for example) or made dependent on location (such as preventing someone from setting up a competing business in the same city).</p>\n<h3><strong>Agreements with Clients and Customers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ensuring that you are on the same footing as your clients is essential if you wish to maintain long-term professional relationships. Without any sort of contract between you and your customers, it is easy to have confusion, leading to one of the parties becoming unhappy with the situation. This can lead to the loss of important clients; or worse, expensive legal situations.</p>\n<h4><strong>Memorandum of Understanding</strong></h4>\n<p>Also referred to as an MoU, a memorandum of understanding is an initial document that outlines the basic structure of your business. An MoU is not a legally binding contract, but is a well-respected stepping stone in the process prior to a full contract that provides a strong degree of commitment from all parties and ensures that everyone involved is fully aware of their responsibilities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Consultant Contract</strong></h4>\n<p>Many companies work as consultants to others, from <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">freelancers providing a service</a>, to established businesses with multiple specialists. A consultant contract is a formalised document that details every aspect of the client-consultant relationship including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The work involved – a clear summary of the project and what the consultant is delivering to the client;</li>\n<li>Consultant services – what the consultant does and does not provide;</li>\n<li>The timeframe – including delivery deadlines and projected end dates;</li>\n<li>Consultant requirements – when there is onus on the client to provide documentation or other work to the consultant, this should be clearly outlined;</li>\n<li>The relationship – with multiple ways of working together, it is important to set out if the consultant is separate business entity or is to be considered a business employee for the project duration, with holiday entitlement and other rights;</li>\n<li>Payment structure – is the cost billed hourly or is there an overall charge for the project? If payment is to be made in stages or there are expenses to cover;</li>\n<li>Intellectual property ownership – who owns the work during the project timeline? Is it passed in full, from consultant to client upon completion?</li>\n<li>Rights for usage and resale – understanding how the work delivered is to be used, and if it can be reused in future and under what terms, must all be defined;</li>\n<li>Early termination – if the project is terminated early for any reason, what agreement is in place to protect either party?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a formal consultant contract in place, work can progress smoothly, and any disputes easily handled.</p>\n<h4><strong>Invoicing</strong></h4>\n<p>An invoice is another legal document that your business will produce to request payment from your customers. With many accounting packages undertaking the task of producing invoices, this is a simple and near-effortless process, but it is important to focus on it during the early days of your business formation.</p>\n<p>In addition to invoicing, it is worth considering additional payment-related documentation, such as purchase orders to have paperwork that confirms an order, and payment reminder letters pre-drafted to avoid difficulties later on with late-paying customers.</p>\n<h2>Being Money Conscious</h2>\n<p>When your business starts to bring in some revenue, it can be easy to get swept up in the success – which has been the downfall of many start-ups!</p>\n<p>Before you put down a deposit for that Aston Martin, you need to make sure your business is financially sound, using the following tips as a guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build reserves in the company of three to six months of cashflow (i.e., your average total monthly expenses multiplied by three to six), so if something happens, you have sufficient funds to pay the bills as they fall due. You won’t necessarily have this to begin with, but it’s something to aim for.</li>\n<li>Put 20% of your turnover aside each month, preferably into a separate business account, so you can pay your tax as it falls due.</li>\n<li>If you are VAT registered; take any VAT you collect and put it into a separate business account.</li>\n<li>In addition to relevant business insurance, you might also want to consider critical illness and or income protection insurance to protect you and your family further.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t spend any money that you don’t need to.</strong> You need to ask yourself; do I <u>really</u> need it? You want to prove the business concept as cheaply as possible in order to understand if you should accelerate your business growth and invest in its future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting an Experienced Business Advisor to help your start up business</h2>\n<p>If this is your first time starting and running your own business, there are a lot of traps that you’ll need to avoid. Putting a strong foundation in place can make the difference between survival and going out of business.</p>\n<p>By working with a business advisor or professional accountancy firm from the start, they will be able to guide you through this uncertain terrain and ensure that as your business grows, you’re protected both financially and legally.</p>\n<p>The main value of having a third-party professional to hand, is the years of industry experience they have to offer. The amount of this advice you choose utilise is dependent on your needs; whether you’re looking for occasional guidance on day-to-day accountancy enquires, or you want a financial mind present during strategic business meetings, a good accountancy firm will be able to offer that versatility in their service.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, by handing over the reins of responsibility when it comes to your book-keeping and business finance management, you can focus on building your empire – knowing that your money is being managed expertly.</p>\n<p><strong>At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, we don’t just help with ensuring you meet your accounting and tax obligations, we are a business partner you can talk to and bounce ideas off while your business grows.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you’re starting out in business and feel you need a financial partner who does more than just your book keeping, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">contact Black and White Accounting</a> or ring 0800 140 4644.</strong></p>\n",

However, if you’re new to running a business or haven’t had a great experience of accounting software in the past, it can be difficult to make the most of the opportunity. Here’s our ultimate guide to help you get started and master accounting software and Making Tax Digital.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Click the links to jump to your section of interest:</p>\n<p><a href=\"#part1\">Part 1 &#8211; Implementing a business accounting system</a><br />\n<a href=\"#part2\">Part 2 &#8211; The benefits and considerations of cloud accounting software</a><br />\n<a href=\"#part3\">Part 3 &#8211; Getting the most from your accounting software</a><br />\n<a href=\"#part4\">Part 4 &#8211; Online tax filing and Making Tax Digital</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"part1\">Part 1 &#8211; 3 Great Reasons to Implement a Business Accounting System from Day One</h2>\n<p>When you’re just setting up in business it can be tempting to ignore your accounting system until you’ve got a clear day to sort it out. New businesses demand huge amounts of time and effort and often the accounts fall very low in your list of priorities. Unfortunately finding that “clear day” becomes harder and harder and inevitably your business accounting system is neglected.</p>\n<p>Naturally, as an accountant, I would advocate prioritising your business accounts from the start. There are obvious benefits such as avoiding a last minute panic when your end of year accounts is due. But I also believe that setting up your accounting systems from the beginning can be beneficial for your whole business; it’s not just about admin they can also influence your business strategy and success.</p>\n<p>Here are three good reasons to implement an effective accounting system from day one:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><strong>An accounting system is a Legal Requirement<br />\n</strong></strong>If you file a tax return it’s a legal requirement to keep records and documents that support that tax return. Therefore it makes good sense to ensure these records are in order from the offset; thus avoiding paying penalties for doing so, or filing an inaccurate return because of poor record keeping.Similarly if you are VAT registered you will need to file quarterly returns, three months comes around very quickly! Poor record keeping can cost you money, not just in penalties but also if you don’t claim back what is owed to you because of mislaid receipts, invoices, expenses etc.</li>\n<li>Managing your cashflow<br />\nFor most business owners the overriding priority when you set up a business is to turn a profit. Whatever the way you are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-start-ups/\">financing your startup</a>, and your financial projections for your first few years of trading, you’ll want to keep a close eye on your cashflow. Having a clear idea of what you owe others, what is owed to you and what is in the bank is crucial. Without this information how can you make any strategic decisions for your business, respond to market changes or cement plans for the future?A basic accounting system puts all this information at your fingertips, empowering you to run your business in a proactive rather than a reactive way.</li>\n<li>Allows you to manage your time effectively<br />\nUltimately a good accounting system will allow you to manage your time effectively. It’s not just the late nights incurred getting your books in shape before HMRC deadlines, it’s also about having your financial information available should you need it for grant applications, business plans, loan agreements etc. I know of several business owners who have missed great opportunities because their accounts were not up-to-date when they needed vital information and didn’t have the time to do them before an important deadline.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Accounting Systems – How to Get Started</strong></p>\n<p>For a new business owner all you need for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">basic bookkeeping</a> is a cash book; sales ledger; purchase ledger, and a wages book. Of course not many businesses have these components as physical books; instead they may take the form of an Excel spreadsheet, computer software or a Cloud Accounting System such as Xero or QuickBooks.</p>\n<p>If you are using an accountant have a conversation about the system they use, it can save you money and time if everyone is familiar with the system. Black and White offer accounting software training as well as support choosing and using a package that’s right for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">Part 2 – The benefits of Cloud Accounting</h2>\n<p>If you are already using something like <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-apps-bookkeeping-software-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Xero, Quickbooks or Sage</a> for your bookkeeping and accounting requirements then you’ll understand why I think this is a great accounting software solution. Gone are the days of delivering shoeboxes full of receipts to your accountant once a year, with cloud accounting you can dispense with this and keep a real-time <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">check on your business finances</a>.</p>\n<h3>Key Benefits of Cloud Accounting</h3>\n<p>There are benefits for both the business owner and their <a href=\"/\">accountant</a> when you use cloud accounting. So if you haven’t already signed up for an account with cloud <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">accounting services</a> consider the following:</p>\n<h4><strong>Reduced Cost</strong></h4>\n<p>No small consideration when we’re talking about your business finances. For a nominal monthly payment you can forget about buying and installing expensive accounting software (and having the hardware to back it up). Plus you can eliminate system admin costs, maintenance, backups, security issues, and upgrades – all this is managed by the service provider.</p>\n<p>An added bonus for the small business owner is that it can also reduce your overall accountancy costs, enabling you (or a member of your team) to do much of the day-to-day bookkeeping yourself.</p>\n<h4><strong>Real-Time Reporting</strong></h4>\n<p>Cloud accounting systems let you keep your accounts up-to-date with the minimum of effort. Invoicing, payments and expenses are all in one place giving you a complete overview of your business finances. Automatic bank feeds import transactions from your bank account, credit card and PayPal, so you always have real-time financial data to hand.</p>\n<h4><strong>Ease of Access</strong></h4>\n<p>Unlike with traditional <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/why-do-i-need-an-accountant-software-can-do-it-all-for-me-right/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"13\">accounting software</a> you don’t need to be on your business’ computer network to access your records. Instead you can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">manage your cash flow</a> wherever you have an internet connection. With mobile apps such the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/webinar-increase-efficiency-in-your-business-with-the-quickbooks-mobile-app/\">QuickBooks Mobile App</a>, expense claims and reconciling your bank statements can be done wherever you happen to be. Great if you’re travelling for business or working away from your laptop.</p>\n<h4><strong>Collaborative Environment</strong></h4>\n<p>Cloud accounting allows you to invite other users to access your financial data. This means you can collaborate with your accountant, financial advisor, bookkeeper or other key members of your team online. Everyone has access to the latest version of your data without needing to visit your office, or for you to transfer data through conventional means.</p>\n<h4><strong>Enhanced Business Performance</strong></h4>\n<p>All the above benefits contribute to a smoother and more cost effective accounting system. But perhaps the most important benefit is the ability to manage your cash flow in real-time, allowing you to monitor your balance sheet, identify issues, respond to changes and take action quickly.</p>\n<p>Some other advantages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much greater storage capacity.</li>\n<li>Instant access to financial information, anywhere with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>Software updates and back-ups done automatically by the provider.</li>\n<li>Protection from physical danger at your premises, such as fire or theft.</li>\n<li>Your accountant can see your data to support and advise you in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moving to cloud based accounting does come with a few areas to consider to make sure you mitigate any risks. Here are a few things to be aware of when choosing a vendor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unauthorised access to your own accounts and customer information – are all of your staff using secure passwords and login details which aren’t used for other services? Are you making use of extra security measures such as multi factor authentication?</li>\n<li>Loss of control. Do you trust your online <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/\">accounting service</a> to have all necessary security and compliance measures in place? Speaking to other business owners about their experiences here can help identify compliant solutions for your sector.</li>\n<li>Multi-tenancy. Your data may be sharing space with information from other businesses, increasing the danger of getting hacked in the crossfire.</li>\n<li>Difficulty tracking data once it’s uploaded into the cloud – make sure you’ve had all of the software training you need to understand the full process.</li>\n<li>Are there sufficient back-up systems in place at your location and your provider’s location? What happens if you lose your internet service? Can you still access records and make offline changes or are you fully reliant on an internet connection?</li>\n<li>What are the upfront and ongoing costs? If you are subscribed to a particular provider, how difficult is it to change later on if a price hike occurs?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"part3\">Part 3 &#8211; Getting more value from your bookkeeping software</h2>\n<p>As a busy owner/manager, book-keeping software could be the answer to your prayers, saving you time on those hated monthly chores such as entering the receipts or sending invoices.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re thinking you don’t need your human accountant anymore, you could be missing out on the biggest benefit that accounting software can deliver.</p>\n<p>No matter how good it is, accounting software can never replace the wealth of business experience, insight into your business and good advice that your own accountant can offer.</p>\n<p>However, if you use your software package correctly, then you’ll be in a position to use your accountant more as a business advisor and financial partner. Challenge your accountant today to ensure you are getting value for money by using your book-keeping software to its full potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Real time information at your fingertips means more power to your elbow</strong></p>\n<p>What accounting software can offer you is a source of up-to-date information on all financial aspects of your business so that you, with support from your accountant, can make better decisions based on accurate data. Your decision making will also be faster and more agile because your accountant isn’t having to trawl through your records to produce an interim report on your financial state.</p>\n<p>At Black and White Accounting we’ve broken away from the old-fashioned image of delivering a transactional service to their client. We build relationships in partnership with our customers so that they feel they can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">contact us</a> whenever they need business advice.</p>\n<p>If they have all their latest financial information to hand in an easy to read report, it makes our job so much easier to give them the right advice when they need it.</p>\n<p>The traditional accountant still thinks that their job is to do the work of HMRC, figuring out how much tax you owe each year and collect their cheque. When they’ve done that, they’re completing a historical record of your business, always looking back to the years gone by.</p>\n<p>Your accountant should be able to analyse today’s figures and give advice at a strategic level on where the business needs to go, whether now is the time to invest and expand or prepare for predicted problems.</p>\n<p>An accountant will deal with many and varied businesses so they should be rich in experience and be willing to use it to your benefit. Some clients are still reluctant to call their accountant as they fear they will be charged for every 6 minutes that they talk, (as they do with their solicitors). However, not all accountants are the same here. We charge a fixed fee and will take the time to go through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your profit and loss &#8211; which shows the difference between your business’s income and expenses during a given period.</li>\n<li>Your cash flow statement – this can help you predict shortfalls when covering day-to-day operating costs. It can influence when you buy or sell an asset, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">lend or borrow money</a>, or make a capital investment, including hiring employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your balance sheet which shows how your profit and loss has translated into assets and liabilities at a given point in time. It shows how liquid your assets are or whether your money is too tied up in equipment. You need this information to decide whether you can afford to invest using your own assets or whether you need to take on additional debt.</p>\n<h3>Tips and Apps to reach your full potential</h3>\n<p>In order to help you get the most from your accounting software, we offer you some tips on how to realise the full potential of your accounting software and to avoid <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/5-common-accounting-mistakes-i-like-see-room-101/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"227\">some common mistakes</a>. There is also often integration with other great apps to ensure you get even more from your book-keeping software.</p>\n<h4><strong>Keep it separate</strong></h4>\n<p>Keep your business and private finances separate. No software is clever enough to recognise whether a trip abroad is a legitimate business expense or a family treat. Why not run an accounting programme at home if you need to keep track of your domestic and business spending?</p>\n<p>Separate your spending and ensure you still stick to your private budget. You can set up different ‘departments’ with your software to easily show different breakdowns, e.g. by store, by format, by branch etc. Some bank account providers like Monzo and Starling will even provide this for you through an app linked to your debit card.</p>\n<h4><strong>Data Inputting (Stay on top of the receipts!)</strong></h4>\n<p>With bank feeds and data apps such as <a href=\"https://www.autoentry.com/\">Auto Entry</a>, Data Mining or <a href=\"https://www.receipt-bank.com/receipt-scanning-app/\">Receipt Bank</a> your software can literally do the hard work for you. It will also segment, based on how you historically categorise things, how it should be accounted for. Never has it been easier to keep your records up to date.</p>\n<h4><strong>Don’t like numbers?</strong></h4>\n<p>We all have different strengths and weaknesses and whilst we love everything numbers related, we appreciate not everyone does! Therefore if you need a more visual way to see your performance, you can get custom reports and visuals to ‘see’ your success.</p>\n<p>You can also use great apps like <a href=\"https://www.futrli.com/\">Futrli</a> or <a href=\"https://www.spotlightreporting.com/\">Spotlight Reporting</a> for even better visualisations.</p>\n<h4><strong>Mileage</strong></h4>\n<p>It is essential that 40% of businesses under account for their business mileage over the year. Why not use an app such as <a href=\"https://www.mileiq.com/\">MileIQ</a>, <a href=\"https://milecatcher.com/\">MileCatcher</a> or <a href=\"https://triplogmileage.com/\">Triplog</a> to log and track your business miles, quickly and easily when you’re on the go?</p>\n<h4><strong>Delegate</strong></h4>\n<p>Are you a start-up entrepreneur who wants to keep a tight grip on costs? Or are you running an established business and want to let your staff know you still have your finger on the pulse? Maybe it’s time to let go and delegate responsibility for running your accounting software so that you can get on with running your business.</p>\n<p>However, choose someone who’s diligent, accurate and understands what needs to be recorded. This could be someone inside or outside your current organisation and you can give them different access depending on the role you want them to fulfil.</p>\n<h4><strong>Consider a new cloud-based accounting software solution</strong></h4>\n<p>If you use a Cloud-based accounting package, you can enjoy additional advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can share your data with your book-keeper, accountant or other team members more easily;</li>\n<li>You can access information anywhere and anytime in the world;</li>\n<li>The price can be cheaper than desktop-based packages and you can pay monthly to ease cash flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modern accounting software like Xero, QuickBooks or SageOne are powerful tools in the right hands, not just spreadsheets to keep HMRC happy!</p>\n<h3>Ready to get more from your accounting software?</h3>\n<p>If you’d like to learn more about how software accounting can help take your relationship with your accountant to the next level, Black and White Accounting can help.</p>\n<p>We have extensive experience in helping small and medium sized businesses adopt the right package.

We always make sure our clients get the most from their accounting software package.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part4\">Part 4 – Online Tax Filing and Making Tax Digital</h2>\n<p>Making Tax Digital is HMRC’s attempt to transform our tax system for the 21st Century by forcing businesses and self-assessing individuals such as landlords to embrace the internet.</p>\n<p>The idea is for every business to have a one-stop Digital Tax Account which is more accessible, simpler to maintain and more regularly updated. More frequent <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> and payments will do away with end-of-year form filling and lump-sum tax bills.<br />\nHMRC wants us all to embrace the inevitability of cloud technology and the advance of online services.</p>\n<p>Whilst it was first announced in the Autumn statement of 2015, in the face of political and some business opposition, the measure was quietly dropped from this spring’s Finance Bill to ensure an easier passage through Parliament. However, this was just a stay of execution.</p>\n<p>Making Tax Digital is now continuing to be rolled out more gradually, which started with VAT-registered business from 2019 and incorporating smaller businesses and individuals from 2020.</p>\n<p>HMRC hopes to make the whole tax system more efficient, lower costs and reduce lost revenue through errors, but what’s in it for us?</p>\n<h3>The benefits of Making Tax Digital</h3>\n<p>We’re all rightly suspicious that any idea coming out of HMRC will mean more administrative burden or costs, higher taxes and on the face of it, this one looks like more work for us. However, at Black and White Accounting, we take a more optimistic view and think that going online could benefit our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/startup-calculator/\">start up</a> and established SME clients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An end to that dreaded year-end rush to dig out old receipts and form filling.</li>\n<li>No more repeating personal information that HMRC should already have.</li>\n<li>Keeping all information in one place should simplify communications with HMRC.</li>\n<li>A better idea of how much money you will owe, easing budget planning.</li>\n<li>An opportunity to modernise your accounting practices and switch to software that can give you better financial information in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Software is a major investment and choosing the right bookkeeping package will be important if you want to take advantage of Making Tax Digital. We do a lot of work for our clients, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-software-implementation-training-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">implementing software and training</a> staff on the most popular packages, including Xero, Sage and Quickbooks.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t use this kind of software yourself, we will be using it on your behalf.</p>\n<h3><strong>The disadvantages of making tax digital</strong></h3>\n<p>The transition for VAT business in particular will not be as game changing. Whilst there are some potential advantages to Making Tax Digital, its success or failure will be down to the design of the software interface between HMRC and your business.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, central government doesn’t have a great track record in this area. Here are some of the things that could go wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over-reliance on computers means cyber security is an issue.</li>\n<li>The cost of buying new software and upgrading hardware to cope with it.</li>\n<li>Not all individuals or businesses have the capacity to switch easily to digital book keeping. Small businesses and the self employed must learn more complex accounting procedures.</li>\n<li>Life could be harder for businesses with fluctuating cash flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is why we work very closely with our software partners to ensure you are in the safest hands.</p>\n<h3>What preparations do you need for Making Tax Digital?</h3>\n<h4>Talk to your accountant</h4>\n<p>Every business will face its own individual challenge to HMRC going online, so the best advice we can give is to talk to your accountant about how you can overcome your particular challenges with Making Tax Digital, and if they’re not interested, find a new one. This is now an annual occurrence so the sooner you’re confident and competent with the system, the less of a worry it becomes.</p>\n<h4>Think Positive</h4>\n<p>Ten years from now we’ll look at the annual ritual of submitting paper returns like something from the era of Dickensian clerks at high desks. Remember what it was like applying for house insurance or hiring a car before 1990?</p>\n<p>Transformation will be a pain we need to get over if we’re to enjoy the benefits of doing business in the modern world.</p>\n<p>A lot of people are still resistant to using their online account with HMRC and, no doubt, they have their reasons. Some people may feel daunted by the technology, others don’t like the idea of giving their data directly to HMRC, and sometimes we just feel nostalgic to the paper returns of the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Relax &#8211; Everyone makes mistakes</strong></p>\n<p>One concern we come across is people afraid of hitting the “send” button and then realising they’ve made a mistake, but even that’s not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>You can make changes and correct mistakes to your tax return up to a year after the online deadline for filing, currently standing at the following dates but likely to change due to Covid-19:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>31 January 2021 for the 2018 to 2019 tax year</li>\n<li>31 January 2022 for the 2019 to 2020 tax year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you miss these deadlines, or you need to amend your return for any other tax year, you can still write to HMRC and your tax bill will be updated based on what you report. You may have to pay more tax or even claim a refund. Keep an eye on the latest dates at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/corrections\">https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/corrections</a></p>\n<h3>Common errors when filing self-assessment tax returns</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the worst offenders which we hope you’ll avoid when filing, either online or off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Filing late. There should be no excuse but still people are hit by late filing penalty payments.</li>\n<li>Forgetting to enclose or complete supplementary pages.</li>\n<li>Forgetting to declare all forms of income, including dividends, interest or capital gains.</li>\n<li>Writing “information to follow”, “as per accounts” or “ditto” instead of the actual figures. Always fill out required boxes in full.</li>\n<li>Forgetting to sign and date your paper copy. Something you needn’t worry about online.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Some advantages of online tax filing</h3>\n<p>HMRC has invested a significant amount of resources into online tax filing because it offers advantages both to them and to us.</p>\n<p>The online <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax filing service</a> offers a number of advantages to registering for an online account with HMRC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s convenient. It’s much more user friendly to go through the step-by-step process online than wading through piles of paper and accounting software and you can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">do your self-assessment tax return</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a>, PAYE for employers and VAT with one online login.</li>\n<li>It’s secure. No need to rely on the post to send sensitive financial material or have forms lying about on your desk (or getting lost by the time you get around to filling them in).</li>\n<li>You can tailor the online form to your circumstances and don’t have to wait for supplementary pages to arrive through the post, especially when you’re close to deadline.</li>\n<li>On the subject of deadlines, those people still filing paper SA100 forms will be sweating right now as the 31 October deadline looms. But the more tech-savvy online filers still have until 31 January – though don’t leave things until the last minute!</li>\n<li>It’s easier to keep and review records in your personal account on the HMRC website.</li>\n<li>You can work on your online return as and when you have time, saving figures as you go.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Accounting Software help is at hand</h3>\n<p>For more information about how cloud-based accounting software could make your life easier, and how to get your team up and running with digital accounting solutions, contact <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">Black and White Accounting</a> on 0800 140 4644.

      "content": "<p>We wanted to give you an update following the Chancellor&#8217;s announcements today, to support workers and businesses, after further lockdown measures were rolled out earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Whilst, as always with Government announcements, the devil is in the details and this will only emerge once the dust settles, we wanted to share the headlines with you, at this stage and will update you further as we hear more.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Please note that in line with the latest Government guidance, to ensure both you and our team remain safe and well we have taken the reluctant decision to close our offices again. They are now open by appointment only, but our preference is to e-meet now.</p>\n<p>You can continue to drop records off and there are places at our offices where you can do this safely and securely but do let us know if you are doing this so we can ensure they are picked up and processed as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Please be reassured especially at this time that we are here and we want to help you in any way we can.</p>\n<h2>Today&#8217;s Announcements</h2>\n<p><strong>Job Support Scheme</strong><br />\nAs expected there are no further extensions to the furlough, or Job Retention Schemes, which comes to an end in October. However, this will be replaced by the new Job Support Scheme, reflecting the change in the support needed to reduce mass job cuts. This will be available from November and will last at least six months.</p>\n<p>Here where an employee works reduced hours due to the reduce demand, their employer will pay them for the hours they work and they will be compensated by their employer <strong>and </strong>the Government, up to one-third of the lost pay each (capped at £697.92 per month).</p>\n<p>The workers must do at least a third of their normal hours and where someone does this minimal amount, they will still get 77% of their normal pay. All small and medium-sized businesses are eligible, but larger businesses will only be eligible where they have experienced reduced turnover, due to the pandemic. Perhaps most importantly, it will be open to employers across the UK, even if they have not previously used the furlough scheme. The government will pay a maximum of 22% of someone&#8217;s <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/payslip-calculator/\">wages</a>, down from 80% at the start of the furlough scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>Government-Backed Loans</strong><br />\nInterestingly both the Bounce Back Loans (CBBLS) and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) will have their repayment period increased from six to ten years, cutting the monthly repayments by nearly half, under the slogan of “pay as you grow” loans. Interest-only payments will also be allowed for a period and the deadline for applying for these will also be extended until the end of November and potentially December.</p>\n<p>Businesses struggling to make repayments can also suspend repayments altogether for six months and will not see their credit rating suffer as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-Employed</strong><br />\nThe Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will be extended to a third grant, in line with the above. The grant will cover three months&#8217; worth of profits for the period from November to the end of January and will cover 20% of average monthly profits up to a total of £1,875. We also understand that a further grant may be available to the self-employed to cover February 2021 to the end of April, depending on circumstances.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no change in the eligibility criteria and the definition of “Self-Employed” is the same as previous grants.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Measures<br />\n</strong>Other points raised included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5% VAT for the tourism and hospitality industries will be extended from January 2021 to 31 March 2021;</li>\n<li>If you deferred your VAT previously, you will be able to pay this balance back over 11 smaller interest-free instalments; and</li>\n<li>HMRC have been instructed to provide more time for income taxpayers to pay their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax return</a> bills if they are unable to do so. Self-Assessment second payments on account which were due by 31 July 2020 but deferred to 31 January 2021 will now be able to be spread over 12 months from January. For personalised assistance in navigating changes to payment schedules and managing self-assessment tax returns, consider consulting with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">knowledgeable self-assessment accountant</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Useful Information</h2>\n<p><strong>Redundancies</strong><br />\nIf you are going to be forced to make difficult decisions on your team with the furlough scheme coming to an end, let us know if we can help with preparing <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">redundancy calculations</a>.</p>\n<p>Remember the usual terms and conditions of employment, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/minimum-wage/\">minimum wage</a> and health &amp; safety (to name but a few) rules all still apply during this difficult time. If you need in-depth help, we’d be happy to refer you to one of our strategic partners, who will be able to help you further.</p>\n<p><strong>Local Lockdown Grants</strong><br />\nThere is a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ministers-announce-new-grants-for-businesses-affected-by-local-lockdowns#:~:text=Ministers%20have%20today%20announced%20new,Steve%20Barclay%20told%20MPs%20today.\">new grant</a> available for businesses in England, who are required to close due to local lockdowns or targeted restrictions. The grant of up to £1,500 (£1,000 for smaller businesses) is provided every three weeks.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Kickstart Scheme</strong></span><br />\nThis <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/kickstart-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scheme </a>is designed to support 16 to 24-year-olds find job placements where they are currently on Universal Credit and at risk of being long-term unemployed. Funding is available to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% of the National Minimum Wage for 25 hours a week;</li>\n<li>Associated Employer <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> contributions; and</li>\n<li>Employer minimum auto-enrolment contributions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scheme has a minimum of 30 job placement requirements. However, this can be addressed, if you work with a representative (who themselves hit this target), so you don’t have to employ 30 people directly yourself.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Companies House</strong></span><br />\nWhilst the time limit for filing limited company accounts has been increased from nine months to twelve months after the year-end, remember there is no extension on the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax return filing deadline</a> and payment deadline with HMRC, which remain twelve months after the year-end and nine months and one day after the year-end respectively (although if it is your first set of accounts you are submitting it might be slightly different).</p>\n<p>From 10 September Companies House also resumed the voluntary strike-off process which had been temporarily on hold. And from 10 October, they will be resuming the compulsory strike-off, where they believe a company is no longer carrying on business or in operation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Fraud is Always Fraud</strong></span><br />\nWe are expecting to see a huge surge in checks and investigations owing to the level of fraud which HMRC believe occurred during the Coronavirus Support Scheme, in particular with Furlough, government-backed loans and SEISS.</p>\n<p>For example, HMRC is already investigating more than 27,000 furlough scheme claims which could be wrong or fraudulent and they believe £3.5bn has been given out wrongly or fraudulently. 80,433 firms have already handed back over £215m.</p>\n<p>Fraud is still fraud, even at times like these.

It may come as a surprise for some business owners, but for a business plan to be meaningful, it needs to evolve with your business.</p>\n<p>To help ensure you’re on the right track with your planning, here are some key considerations whether you’re just starting out or you’re facing some internal or external changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Why have a business plan?</strong></p>\n<p>There are several reasons why taking time to write a business plan is a good investment of your time. If you commit to your planning process as an ongoing process and not a one-off activity and make business planning integral to your business it can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help prevent your business from stalling by providing a clear sense of direction. This clarity can in turn help keep you motivated, even during difficult times.</li>\n<li>A well structured business plan with clear goals can keep you organised and being organised helps relieve stress.</li>\n<li>Regularly reviewing what your business is achieving and comparing this against your business plan helps let you know how well you are doing and course correct as necessary.</li>\n<li>If you want to expand the business or be more competitive, planning can help you define what goals need to be set and the actions needed to achieve them.</li>\n<li>Business <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"142\">plans define goals and give you an opportunity</a> to think about how these can be achieved. Without a clear path it’s easier to falter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>When should you update your business plan?</strong></p>\n<p>Regularly is the simple answer, but there are also more specific times when ensuring you have an updated business plan becomes particularly important. You should therefore take the opportunity to review your business plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the start of each financial year. Business performance information provided by year end accounts help provide focus on interim targets when thinking about your longer-term objectives.</li>\n<li>As your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-start-ups/\">business transitions from its start-up</a> phase to a more established state. If you have found success early it can be easy to forget about a business plan, but not having one could see your business stall or plateau.</li>\n<li>When looking for investment or finance, to help demonstrate the long-term potential and a deep understanding of what you are doing.</li>\n<li>When launching a new product or service, expanding into new markets or going through a period of change. The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/brexit-business-guide/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"35\">impact of Brexit</a> is a prime example where businesses have had to revisit their business planning to ensure they are adapting to changes.</li>\n<li>When there’s disruption in the market from changes in your competition or you see shifts in your customer behaviour. This will allow you to assess your business in the changing context and adjust accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Business plans shouldn’t be over complicated in their format and a one-page summary of key points can help to ensure your plan is something you refer to regularly. However, if you’re not confident in your plan, can’t remember when you last saw it or don’t have a document you are comfortable with showing to a potential investor, then your business plan probably needs work. We can help you sharpen up your plan and check that your finances are healthy at the same time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">Part 2 – Record Keeping for Success</h2>\n<p>“I broke two of my dad’s Queen records…now I want to break three.” Sorry but I am a Dad so please forgive the Dad joke.</p>\n<p>Ok, wrong kind of record, but it might not sound like it, but Record Keeping is exciting because it can help you with the following…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep track of your expenses;</li>\n<li>Ask for a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">bank loan</a> or credit, if you need to;</li>\n<li>See quickly what you are owed by others and how much you owe them;</li>\n<li>Save time and accountancy costs;</li>\n<li>Pay the correct amount of tax;</li>\n<li>Receive the correct amount of benefits or credits; and</li>\n<li>Avoid paying any extra tax or penalties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The sooner you get a good system, the better</strong>. It will make your life easier and can avoid potential penalties due to inaccurate accounts and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">tax returns</a> being filed.</p>\n<p>The sort of records you need to keep depends upon the type of tax you have to pay.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to keep your financial records</strong></h3>\n<p>The law does not say how you must keep your records. You can keep them on paper, digitally or as part of a software program (e.g., Auto Entry, ReceiptBank, QuickBooks, Sage, Xero etc) as long as the method you use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Captures all the information on the document <strong>(front and back);</strong> and</li>\n<li>Allows the information to be presented to your accountant in a readable format, if we need to see it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How long to keep your financial records for</strong></h3>\n<p>Generally, you should keep your records for a minimum of six years. However, if you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an employer, you need to keep Pay As You Earn (‘PAYE’) records for 3 years (in addition to your current year);</li>\n<li>a contractor in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">the Construction Industry Scheme</a> (‘CIS’), you need to keep your CIS records for 3 years (in addition to your current year); and</li>\n<li>keeping records to complete a personal (non-business) <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>, you only need to keep them for 22 months from the end of the tax year to which they relate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you need to keep records for other reasons, for example the Companies’ Act requires <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited companies</a> to keep specific records and you also use those records for tax purposes, you need to be aware that there may be different time limits for retaining them. Be careful not to destroy any records you also use for tax purposes too early. Therefore, when considering how long to retain records for, you might want to consider the Enquiry window HMRC has available.</p>\n<p>There are three-time limits here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ‘normal time limit’ applies for assessment, refunds and claims.</li>\n<li>HMRC may go back and assess the previous 6 years if that taxpayer’s failure to self-assess correctly was due to ‘careless behaviour’; and</li>\n<li>In cases of ‘deliberate behaviour’ (i.e., fraud) HMRC may raise assessments for the previous 20 years. A higher bar of evidence is however required to prove this.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Years</strong></td>\n<td width=\"140\"><strong>Normal time limit</strong></td>\n<td width=\"144\"><strong>Careless behaviour</strong></td>\n<td width=\"144\"><strong>Deliberate behaviour</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong></td>\n<td width=\"140\">4</td>\n<td width=\"144\">6</td>\n<td width=\"144\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Corporation Tax</strong></td>\n<td width=\"140\">4</td>\n<td width=\"144\">6</td>\n<td width=\"144\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\"><strong>Income Tax</strong></a></td>\n<td width=\"140\">4</td>\n<td width=\"144\">6</td>\n<td width=\"144\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>PAYE</strong></td>\n<td width=\"140\">4</td>\n<td width=\"144\">6</td>\n<td width=\"144\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>VAT</strong></td>\n<td width=\"140\">4</td>\n<td width=\"144\">4</td>\n<td width=\"144\">20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>More Information</h2>\n<p>Has this given you a taste and you want to find out more?</p>\n<h2 id=\"part3\">Part 3 – Documents, Stationery and Correspondence</h2>\n<p>OK; perhaps not the most interesting section, but nonetheless something we need to cover, so you don’t receive unnecessary fines. Did you know there were certain details of your business which are requirements on certain documents and correspondence?</p>\n<p>There are different requirements depending on the type of business (e.g., limited company versus a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> or partnership) and the industry in question, which we go into more detail on below.</p>\n<h2><strong>Requirements for Letterheads and Order Forms</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting with the most challenging of these, please see the table below for the requirements here:</p>\n<table width=\"680\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"680\"><strong>Sole Trader</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"680\">You can trade under your own name, or you can choose a different name (“trading as”). You therefore need to include:– Trading As name;– Your name; and</p>\n<p>– Business Address</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"680\"><strong>Partnership</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"680\">You must include:– names of all partners;– the address of the main office</p>\n<p>– If there are many partners then it is also acceptable to state where a list of partners may be found.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"680\"><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-liability-partnership-services/\">Limited Company (private or public) or a Limited Liability Partnership</a> </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"680\">– Your full registered company name;– The company registration number and place of registration;– The company registered address and the trading address (i.e., where it operates from), if different;</p>\n<p>There is no need to include the names of the directors on the letterhead for a limited company, but if you choose to name directors all directors must be named.</p>\n<p>Most letterheads also include a telephone and fax number, a url for the business’ website and an email address.</p>\n<p>There are also additional requirements for investment companies (as defined by section 266 of the Companies Act 1985), for a company exempt from using the word ‘limited’ in its name and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/charity-accounting-services/\">Charitable Companies</a>.</p>\n<p>For a company with share capital, it is not necessary to state the share capital on stationery but if the company chooses to do so, the paid-up share capital rather than the authorised capital must be stated.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>These requirements apply to both printed and electronic formats.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What to include on Invoices</strong></h2>\n<p>Now this is another more challenging one, so please see the table below for what information your invoice needs to include, based on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include\">GOV.UK website</a>:</p>\n<table width=\"623\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"623\"><strong>Sole Trader or Partnership</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"623\">&#8211; Your name and any business name being used;- An address where any legal documents can be delivered to you if you are using a business name; and- VAT amount, if applicable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"623\"><strong>Limited Company (private or public) or a Limited Liability Partnership</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"623\">&#8211; A unique identification number;- Your company name, address and contact information;- The company name and address of the customer you’re invoicing;</p>\n<p>&#8211; A clear description of what you’re charging for;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The date the goods or service were provided (supply date);</p>\n<p>&#8211; The date of the invoice;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The amount(s) being charged;</p>\n<p>&#8211; VAT amount, if applicable; and</p>\n<p>&#8211; The total amount owed.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If your business is VAT-registered, there are further requirements, which are detailed <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vat-record-keeping/vat-invoices\">here</a>. HMRC will also expect to see sequential invoice numbers used, so they can track and check all the sales invoices are complete and included in your accounts and tax returns.</p>\n<h2><strong>What to include on your Email Footer</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are a Limited Company (private or public) or a Limited Liability Partnership, your email footer must include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company name;</li>\n<li>Company registration number (you can ask your Accountant, or see this on Companies House <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/\">website</a>);</li>\n<li>Place of registration (e.g., England &amp; Wales, Scotland or Northern Island); and</li>\n<li>Registered office address (as opposed to your Trading address, which may be different. This again you can confirm with your Accountant, or see this on Companies House <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/\">website</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No matter your role, be it the Director or Apprentice, this applies to everyone in the organisation. These rules do not apply to Sole Traders and Partnerships.</p>\n<h2><strong>Your Business Premises Sign</strong></h2>\n<p>Just for completeness; Limited Company (private or public) or a Limited Liability Partnerships are always obliged to display a sign showing your name, unless you are running your business from your home address. This needs to be at both your registered address (i.e., what Companies House states) and your trading address(es) (i.e., where you operate from), if different. The sign must be easy to read and visible at any time; whether you are open or not.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other disclosure rules</strong></h3>\n<p>There may be further requirements, depending on the industry you operate in. For example, if you are in Financial Services, you may have to state you are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Please check with your regulator, trade body or association in case you have any further requirements and for guidance on best practice.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penalties</strong></h3>\n<p>If you fail to meet your legal obligations, you can be fined up to £1,000 for the offence itself and then for continued breach a daily penalty of up to £100 can be levied. Regulators in specific industries may also impose their own penalties.</p>\n<h3><strong>Contact us today</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are not sure how to navigate your way through this, or have any other questions about your obligations as a business owner, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part4\">Part 4 – GDPR for SMEs</h2>\n<p>There are huge numbers of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/millionaire-calculator/\">businesses set up to make money</a> from General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), whether it’s offering to make your business GDPR compliant, or advising people how to sue you.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of information online trying to explain what it’s all about but in summary, if you handle a client’s personal data in the way you’d like your own to be handled, then you won’t fall foul of GDPR.</p>\n<p>Here we&#8217;ve cut through the swathes of information available on GDPR to tell you how we’ve been answering our clients’ most frequent questions.</p>\n<h3>What is GDPR for?</h3>\n<p>The aim of GDPR is to give individuals more control over their personal data and to impose responsibilities on data collectors to ensure its security.</p>\n<p>Although GDPR are EU regulations, they’re coming regardless of Brexit and replaced the Data Protection Act on 25 May <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/summary-of-the-2018-budget/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"215\">2018</a>. They apply to any business that collects, uses and stores personal information for its operation.</p>\n<p>They cover the processing of personal data by automated and non-automated means, that’s intended to form part of a filing system. This includes anything from invoicing records to marketing databases and more personal data that enables you to provide your services.</p>\n<h3>What is personal data?</h3>\n<p>GDPR broadens the definition of personal data to include anything relating to an identifiable person. As well as the usual (name, address, contact details), an identifier now includes physical, cultural, genetic or social information. A combination of data may be enough to identify someone even if they aren’t actually named.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s my responsibility?</strong></p>\n<p>No matter the size of your business, if you collect, use and keep data, you are a “data controller” which means you are responsible for how that personal information is used and for keeping it safe.</p>\n<p>You must only collect and keep information for legitimate business needs and only for as long as is necessary. This may be for the time you’re providing a service or it may be as long as tax record regulations specify, there’s no upper limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Your responsibility for third party data processors</strong></p>\n<p>As the “data controller” you’re also responsible for the actions of any third party you employ as a “data processor”. This could be a sub-contractor or an outside agency, such as a supplier or a credit check agency. You need to confirm that they also have proper GDPR policies in place.</p>\n<h3>Who enforces GDPR?</h3>\n<p>In the UK, enforcement is the responsibility of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens if I breach GDPR?</strong></p>\n<p>Where possible, you need to report certain types of personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. If there is a high risk of adversely affecting someone’s rights and freedoms, you must also inform those people without undue delay.</p>\n<p>The ICO can fine you up to 4% of your turnover (or £20 million, whichever is greater, though the ICO has promised that fines will be kept below £1-2 million!). You can also be sued by the data subject for compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>What should I do right now?</strong></p>\n<p>Here are my top five actions I’d advise sole traders and SME owner-managers to take to make sure you’re following GDPR:</p>\n<p><strong>Ask for consent.</strong> You need to ask existing and new clients for permission to collect, use and hold personal data. Include the following in your request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name, company name, and the name of relevant third parties working on your behalf</li>\n<li>Why you need to collect the data</li>\n<li>How the data will be used</li>\n<li>Whether, and why, any data needs to be passed to a third-party processors and how consent for that may be withdrawn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you keep a copy of your clients’ consent, preferably in written form.</p>\n<p><strong>Carry out a review of the data you already hold.</strong> Check all personal information that you currently hold, confirming:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it accurate?</li>\n<li>Do you need it for your business?</li>\n<li>How securely is it being held?</li>\n<li>Do you still need to keep it?</li>\n<li>How would you delete it securely?</li>\n<li>Are you abiding by your own GDPR rules?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a good idea to review the data you hold every year.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a </strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/privacy-policy/\">privacy policy.</a> You can send this to clients to inform them clearly how you collect and hold their personal data. Your notice to them should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What information is being collected</li>\n<li>Who collects it, and how</li>\n<li>Why it’s being collected</li>\n<li>How it will be used</li>\n<li>Who it will be shared with</li>\n<li>How collected data will affect them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also make clear how the client can withdraw consent for you to hold and use their data in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Review all third party data processors you work with.</strong> Make sure you don’t put yourself at risk because of bad practices by a third party; ask for a copy of their privacy policy to confirm that all personal data provided by you will be processed in accordance with GDPR. Keep a copy of their reply.</p>\n<p><strong>Find out if you need to register with the ICO.</strong> The law entitles landlords to ask for a reference and to share a tenant’s details with a third party for the purpose of making a contract of tenure, so small scale landlords probably won’t have to register.<br />\nIf you plan to share details with a third party for any other reason, then you will need to <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/\">register with the ICO</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>What&#8217;s happened in the GDPR world so far?</strong></h3>\n<p>In a report recently released, the ICO detailed their work over the last year, including their support for individuals, organisations and Data Protection Officers as well as the action taken.</p>\n<p>Their actions have led to more awareness of privacy rights and they are holding organisations to a higher standard for the protection of personal data. However, in one example particularly, we have observed the standards slipping back to the old world.</p>\n<p>Remember in the lead up how many organisations reached out to you with requests to opt-in to them providing you with marketing materials (as opposed to the previous opt-out regime)? However, as the deadline passed, even if you didn’t opt-in to receive those marketing materials, they still came. Worse still, they have increased significantly overtime. No, they are not the same levels they were before the change, and the gap is definitely decreasing.</p>\n<p>The reality is that it is a marathon rather than a sprint. Rather than focussing on big fines, the ICO aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respond effectively to breaches;</li>\n<li>Be proportionate in the application of sanctions;</li>\n<li>Continue to support compliance with the law; and</li>\n<li>Be proactive in identifying new risks from technological and societal change.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What have the Biggest GDPR Fines been so far?</strong></h3>\n<p>That said, with fines of up to €20 million, or 4% of annual global turnover – whichever is greater, the focus was always going to fall on the size of the fines.</p>\n<p>The first two headline grabbers have been:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>British Airways: £183m for a security breach where approximately 500,000 customers’ personal data was compromised; and</li>\n<li>Marriott International Inc: £99m when “a cyber incident” affecting its Starwood chain resulted in approximately 339m customer records (7m UK residents) being exposed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which leads you to ask, how much would Facebook’s fine have been had the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica taken place after GDPR had come into play?</p>\n<p>Away from the headlines the ICO received around 14,000 personal data breach reports up to 1 May 2019, with over 12,000 closing during the year. Of those, 17.5% required action from the organisation and less than 0.5% led to either an improvement plan or civil monetary penalty. There has been a sharp increase in complaints from the public too with over 41,000 up to 1 May 2019, with subject access requests being the highest complaint category. In addition, the ICO has issued their first penalty notices for non-payment of the data protection fee.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I comply with GDPR?</strong></h3>\n<p>Compliance with GDPR is an ongoing process and businesses should continue to focus on their accountability and demonstrating how they comply with the rules. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue embedding privacy and information security in their general risk assessments;</li>\n<li>Prioritise compliance with the core GDPR principles (including accountability, transparency and lawfulness of data processing e.g., notice and consent);</li>\n<li>Watch-out for regulatory developments, including guidelines on specific areas;</li>\n<li>Make the most of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tools-and-resources/\">tools and resources</a> which are made available to facilitate compliance; and</li>\n<li>Continue to foster a culture of privacy in the organisation (including emphasis on training, data subject rights and requests, breach reporting, information security, and compliance documentation).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"part5\">Part 5 – Exit and Succession strategies</h2>\n<p>Many small business owners choose the “burying my head in the sand” approach when their business is facing financial difficulty, which can be the nail in the coffin for a business that is struggling.</p>\n<p>An alarming number of businesses fail every year, and the reasons for the failure are as many and varied as the businesses themselves. In some cases, recognising the early warning signs can help set in motion a plan for recovery or in the worst case scenario, plan an exit strategy for the business owner.</p>\n<p>So what are the warning signs that you should be on the look out for?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you pay your suppliers when they are due?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Falling behind with payments and allowing supplier invoices to go overdue for payment is a sign of cashflow issues. A business in this situation must <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">draw up a cash flow projection</a> (we can help you with this) and identify the cause of the problem.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Will your business pass the balance sheet test?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your liabilities (debts and money owed) are greater than your assets (cash, equipment, property and money owed to you) then your company may well be insolvent. This is a major issue that needs addressing immediately. Again, it is vital to understand the underlying cause of the problem and discuss this with us.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Do you know if your sales are going up or down?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Timely financial information is the lifeblood of a successful business and in most cases waiting until year end to see where your sales are is just too late. Regular management accounts should not only help you see sales patterns, but also identify which products or services are doing better than others.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What is your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/gross-profit-calculator/\">gross profit margin</a>?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are selling products, you need to be confident that you are making a profit on every product you sell (unless of course it is a loss leader) to cover not only the cost you bought or made the product for, but also your business overheads. If you are selling a service you will no doubt have an hourly rate that you charge your clients for your time. If so, you will need to account for all of your time and ensure that your invoices are correct.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Are your suffering entrepreneur fatigue?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Small businesses are often a labour of love and it is difficult to establish a firm work-life balance. If you are finding it hard to switch off from your business, you are likely to become run down or feel increased levels of stress, which will in turn compromise your health and wellbeing. To give your business the best chance you need to protect it’s most valuable asset; you!</p>\n<p>At Black and White accounting we can help you understand your year end accounts, prepare and talk you through regular monthly accounts or simply talk you through your options if your business is struggling.</p>\n<p>One of the first things we ask business clients at Black and White accounting is “What’s your exit strategy?” which surprises most people. They’ve never been asked that by their accountants, or business advisors before, so they usually need a bit of time to reflect.</p>\n<p>Quitting your business might sound negative when you’ve barely started but what you’re doing is setting your goals for your business. Your succession plan defines what success will look like and everything needs to be worked back from that point, including your business structure, organisational structure, vision and values etc. You also need to break your goals down into bite-sized chunks to ensure you get there.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say you’ll have the same idea in five or ten years’ time, but if you have some goals, even if they change, you’ll know if you’re being successful or not.</p>\n<h3>Exit options</h3>\n<p>It’s important to know what exit options you have and to choose which will suit you best. Generally, owners have five ways to exit their business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Close the business down.</strong> If your business comes to a natural end, you can sell assets (stock, property etc), settle liabilities and walk into the sunset. If it is a company and the net reserves are more than £25,000, a liquidator will need to be appointed otherwise an accountant can complete the process. Entrepreneurs <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">relief will often ease the tax</a> liability here.</li>\n<li><strong>Sell part, or all of your business, either by a trade and asset sale or a share sale.</strong> You need to talk to your accountant about which option is best for your circumstances, as it will not only impact the selling price but also your income/corporation tax, VAT, employment tax, and potentially capital gains tax position.</li>\n<li><strong>Management buy-out.</strong> If you have a good team in place, they can buy you out from within. This is good for continuity and both parties are dealing with known entities, so hopefully there will be fewer surprises.</li>\n<li><strong>Run as an investment.</strong> No one likes to think it but if you have the right team in place, you are replaceable. Why not get a great manager or management team in to run your business? You can then reap the rewards of your work but on an arms length basis so you can focus on your other interests.</li>\n<li><strong>Merger or acquisition.</strong> This can often be with businesses in a similar sector but potentially a different size to you. By combining you can unlock profitability by benefitting from economies of scale, complimentary skills or resources and efficiencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Larger companies can also take advantage of IPO’s but as these are not Black and White’s typical clients we have not focused on these here.</p>\n<p>Whichever option you choose comes down to circumstances and personal preference, but they all require preparation planning. Waiting until the last minute runs the risk that your business is in the wrong shape and you won’t realise the best return for it.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a business to sell?</h3>\n<p>Is you business just “you”? When you walk away, there’s nothing left to sell, other than maybe a few small assets, so if you want to extract some value, you need to start handing over critical functions to others early on. Not only does this free up your time for other more important things, often to accelerate your growth, but it makes your business more sustainable after you’ve gone.</p>\n<h3>Don’t dilute your equity</h3>\n<p>If you plan to sell your business, you need to make sure you don’t give too much of it away beforehand.</p>\n<p>A lot of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounting-for-start-ups-ultimate-guide/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"202\">start-ups</a>, raise money by selling shares through the EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme), which is a tax efficient way of investing money. Others offer share options for staff, for example through EMI (Enterprise Management Incentive) schemes which are a great way to motivate and reward staff. These can be a great way of unlocking funds and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-can-i-incentivise-my-key-staff/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"51\">incentivising staff</a> to accelerate growth. However, such actions can lead to the inevitable cycle of giving your company away and ultimately selling it.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you prefer to get £2million back in five years or £10million back in ten years?</strong></p>\n<p>You need to make decisions based on what you want, rather than be persuaded by other people’s desires.</p>\n<h3>Case study: how a business-savvy accountant can smooth your exit</h3>\n<p>A recent client of ours ran a high street hardware store in a market town. It’s a declining sector and they wanted to get out because it was increasingly tough to make the business pay. We worked with the owner to get the business in the best possible position before finding a purchaser. We then helped broker a deal to ensure the town retained a hardware supplier and our client received enough money to start a new life.</p>\n<p>We were able to help this client, albeit at the last minute, the sooner we are involved the more we can do!</p>\n<p>Another client only talked to us after <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/buying-a-franchise/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"93\">buying a business</a> that was to see them through to retirement. The result was they were tied into a four-year agreement by the seller that will cost them tens of thousands of pounds and won’t help them achieve their exit plan. We are working hard to find them refinancing options to improve their position but if we’d been involved before the purchase took place we could have done more!</p>\n<p>If you need a team to help get your business set up, sold on or just running smoothly, then <a href=\"/contact-us/\">contact Black and White Accounting</a> today or ring us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

If you are an employer, then it is your responsibility to check that your employees are legally allowed to work in the UK. The fine payable by employers has now doubled to £20,000 per illegal worker, making it imperative that you have a water-tight system in place when taking on staff.</p>\n<p>In order check your employee is allowed to work in the UK, your employee will need to provide documentation from one of the two lists provided by the Government. If your employee provides a document from List A (for example a UK passport) you will only need to check the document once at the start of the employment. If your employee provides a document from List B (for example a current passport endorsed to show the holder is allowed to stay and work in the UK) you will need to check the documents every 6 months.</p>\n<p>When you perform a check of the documents, you will need to do so in the presence of the employee, to verify the photograph, and you must check the document has not expired. You will then need to take a photocopy of the document, making a record of the date that the check was made. You must keep the photocopy securely and in compliance with the Data Protection laws, for the duration of the worker’s employment, plus 2 years after they have left.</p>\n<p>Another employment law which is rarely relevant but of great importance is around employment tribunals. These take place when there is a dispute between an employer and employee and take place to attempt to settle the dispute between the parties without proceeding to a full hearing.</p>\n<p>Following a consultation on the in 2013 measure, two main charges will be applied. The first will be payable at the issue of the claim. The second, a hearing fee, will be due four weeks before the hearing takes place.</p>\n<p>When the fees came in, experts were split, with one saying “The two-stage fee structure chosen by the Government is attractive because it incentivises settlement and provides a fairer basis for cost contribution, reflecting a ‘pay for what you use’ approach, as against a single issue fee.”</p>\n<p>However, they warned that this system will create extra administration and add more complexity to claims.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with this two-stage structure, there are two fee levels, depending on the nature of the case. Level one cases began incurring charges of £390, level two cases costing £1,200, assuming that both the initial payment and the hearing fee has been paid.</p>\n<p>At the time of introduction the Government had to be careful to address concerns that fees would prevent poor claimants from receiving justice for genuine claims. This is also balanced with the risk that the majority will become eligible for fee remission or a waiver, thus diminishing the purpose of the charges. In order to balance out any unfairness, claimants will be refunded the cost of the fees if they win their case. The charges can also be reduced or waived if a claimant is unable to meet the costs.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about employee related legal fees, talk to Black and White Accounting for advice – <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">email</a> or call 0800 140 4644 today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">Part 2 – Understanding National Insurance</h2>\n<p>Paying yourself or your employees the correct amount can often be affected by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> contributions. These are separate to tax but calculated in a similar manner and is used for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">state benefits like statutory sick pay, state pensions</a>, Jobseeker’s allowance and bereavement benefits. Your National Insurance contributions are paid to HMRC and build up your entitlement to various state benefits. Everyone aged between 16 and the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions/\">State Pension</a> age will be required to pay National Insurance on their earnings over the various thresholds.</p>\n<p>HMRC keeps detailed records of the National Insurance that you have paid over the course of your working life. You can request this statement from HMRC at any time, which will give you an indication of the state pension you can expect.</p>\n<p>You will also be given the opportunity to make voluntary NIC payments in order to top up your entitlement. At present you need to have 30 qualifying years of National Insurance credits or payments to get the full State Pension.</p>\n<p>The amount of National Insurance you have to pay depends on your work situation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you are employed you will pay Class 1 National Insurance at a rate of 12% on your earnings between £183 and £962 per week (which translates to £792 to £4,167 per month). You will also pay 2% of your earnings over £962 per week. These payments should be deducted from your salary by your employer.</li>\n<li>If you are self employed you will pay both Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance. Class 2 is paid at a flat rate of £3.05 a week unless your annual earnings are under £6,475. HMRC will send you quarterly statements to request this payment. Class 4 National Insurance is payable on your annual business profits between £9,501 and £50,000 at a rate of 9% and a further 2% on profits over £50,000. Class 4 will be calculated when you submit your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self assessment tax return</a> and payable on the 31st January following the end of the tax year.</li>\n<li>You can make voluntary Class 3 National Insurance contributions, which you can pay to HMRC on a monthly or quarterly basis. This helps fill any gaps when National Insurance was not paid or contributions were lower than they should have been. A voluntary Class 3A national insurance contribution also came into effect in 2016, allowing pensioners to top up their additional State Pension.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course you are able to make payments into a personal pension fund and there are many different products available. We highly recommend that you seek the advice of a qualified Independent Financial Adviser when choosing investments and pension products and navigating <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have any queries regarding National Insurance, please don’t hesitate to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">get in touch</a> and our team of qualified accountants will be happy to advise.

Instead, employees will pay the tax on a monthly basis through their payroll rather than through an adjustment of their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">individual tax</a> code in the following year.</p>\n<p>Employers can payroll the majority of benefits they offer but they can also choose not to include all the benefits they offer.</p>\n<h3>How do these schemes work?</h3>\n<p>Applications for a PSA needs to be submitted by 5 July following the end of the tax year and will need to detail the benefits to be included. Once agreed with HMRC the PSA remains in place if the employer or HMRC don’t make any changes or cancel it.</p>\n<p>As for payrolling benefits, this is a voluntary process and applications to payroll benefits must be made on or before the start of the tax year in which the employer wants to payroll benefits. Applications should be made through the payroll and benefits online services tool. Once established, HMRC will assume that employers will continue to payroll benefits.</p>\n<h3>Specialist tax advice from Black and White Accounting</h3>\n<p>To set up these schemes and understand their subtleties and details, employers should seek specialist <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/software-spotlight-tax-advice-and-planning-for-businesses-at-black-white-accounting/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"230\">tax advice</a> to ensure they utilise both PSA and the payrolling of benefits to their full potential.</p>\n<p>If you would like further information about PSA and payrolling benefits and expenses our specialist tax <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/we-are-black-and-white/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"23\">team at Black and White</a> can help you.

Employees eligible for automatic enrolment have the right to opt out within the first month, just as non-eligible staff can volunteer to opt in.</p>\n<h3>Ongoing compliance requirements</h3>\n<p>With an average of 50,000 small businesses a month auto-enrolling between 2015 and 2018, the demand for advice has overwhelmed specialists. It’s no surprise then that while many companies have complied with the administrative processes and deadlines, they’re failing to meet other, ongoing, requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing access for employees to proper financial advice and education.</li>\n<li>Taking regular independent financial advice on benefits and features available in the market.</li>\n<li>No system for ongoing governance of the scheme to ensure it remains compliant.</li>\n<li>Re-enrolling employees in the scheme. As a result, many employers are just looking for the simplest and cheapest option – missing out on the opportunity to greater incentivise their staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is the penalty for failing to comply with Workplace Pensions auto-enrolment guidelines?</h3>\n<p>In 2017, Johnsons Shoe Company was fined £40,000 by the Pensions Regulator and paid £2,000 in costs.</p>\n<p>Despite numerous reminders, Johnsons failed to check which of its staff were qualified for auto enrolment and to inform the Pensions Regulator. The company claimed it had been too busy, which clearly cut no ice with the regulator.</p>\n<p>More recently, this Summer the chairman of Samuel Smith Old Brewery was fined £8,000, and his company nearly £19,000, because they failed to provide the Pensions Regulator with information about the financial state of the business. (This was required for checks into whether its pension schemes were being supported adequately).</p>\n<p>Some businesses have tried refusing to pay fines but they can be taken to court, and the regulator now has powers to seize assets! Professional advisors also have the responsibility to report any breaches to the regulator, so it is likely there will be more high profile examples coming into the spot light!</p>\n<h3>Black and White Accounting can help you with workplace pensions</h3>\n<p>If you’re not sure whether you’re meeting your ongoing workplace pension obligations, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> can help by providing timely and up-to-date advice.

Every court case seems to blur the lines between the self-employed, workers and employees.</p>\n<h3>Gig Work, Freelancing &amp; The Impact on Employers…</h3>\n<p>Whilst the political battles continue over whether the gig economy is “flexploitation” and big corporations using employment law and tax loopholes, the reality is that a more flexible approach to working hours is becoming popular.</p>\n<p>The Office of National Statistics says that in 2015, out of a total workforce of more than 31 million in the UK, 800,000 were on zero hours contracts and nearly two million <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">people were freelancing</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s important for employers, employees and freelancers to understand where they stand, particularly surrounding IR35 regulations, or risk fines from HMRC.</p>\n<h3>What’s the difference between the self-employed, workers and employees?</h3>\n<p>The wording and content of a contract are crucial but from HMRC’s perspective, the actual performance is equally as important. A self-employed freelancer, or contractor, has a contract for services, whereas an employee will have a contract of services, or an employment contract.</p>\n<p>A freelancer is committed to delivering an outcome for the contractee, whether in services or delivered goods, and usually to a deadline. How they do it, what tools they use and who actually carries out the work, is down to the contractor.</p>\n<p>While a self-employed contractor has greater freedom, for example to work for other employers, they have to provide their own equipment and miss out on employment rights such as a workplace pension, holiday and sick pay, maternity and paternity rights and redundancy pay-outs.</p>\n<p>An employment contract names a specific person to carry out a role. They can’t be substituted and the contractee dictates how, where, when and for how long they perform a service. A zero-hours worker is also an employee, but their contract does not specify set hours of work. However, they still have rights and obligations like any other employee.</p>\n<p>The grey area between the self-employed and the employed…</p>\n<p>Once an employer requires a particular contractor to be on site and asks them to work set hours to the exclusion of other contracts, gives them an office or tools for the job and controls their activities, then they start to look like an employee, with the employment rights and tax implications this brings.</p>\n<h3>Tax implications for freelancers</h3>\n<p>If you’re an employee, you don’t have to worry about bookkeeping unless you have sources of income in addition to your salary, for example a buy-to-let property, bank interest, or shares, because your employer will deduct and pay income tax and National Insurance from your wages.</p>\n<p>However, self-employed freelancers are responsible for making their own tax and national insurance contributions. We advise clients to put aside a percentage from each settled invoice to cover the tax bill they receive twice a year from HMRC.</p>\n<p>Generally, for a given earnings level; a self-employed individual will pay less tax, so take home more income. (If they have a good accountant! There are many ways to ensure you are only paying the amount of tax you need to. For example, by using the right business structure, tax planning, investments and pensions.)</p>\n<p>We also offer book keeping services to make sure clients record all allowable business expenses to offset profits and free up their time so they can focus on what they so best – their business!</p>\n<p>If you’re self-employed, you should also consider a personal pension, the most tax-efficient way of planning for the future.</p>\n<h3>The Uber effect on freelancing</h3>\n<p>Disruptive business models, as used by Uber, have unlocked the employment market for many workers and things will never be the same again. In fact, the research company Gartner predicts that by 2020, 30% of the UK workforce will be freelancing.</p>\n<p>The Government, HMRC and legislators who make decisions, for example, on statutory benefits, will have to adapt the employment framework to be more flexible. In the meantime, Black and White Accounting are here to help.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Business advice and accounting services in Hampshire and Surrey for Self-employed, Workers and Employees</h3>\n<p>At Black and White we help businesses and individuals of all sizes to plan financially for the future, keep on top of their accounts and pay only the tax they need to.</p>\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">specialist self-assessment accountant</a>s, with expertise in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-services/\">income tax, corporation tax</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">book keeping &amp; payroll</a> and VAT, so we will ensure you get the support you need.

This will be reviewed in January 2021, with the expectation being, if things are more back to the ‘new normal’ that employers will start paying a greater proportion of the costs as the scheme is phased out, as before.</p>\n<p>Anyone made redundant after 23 September 2020 can be rehired and put back on furlough, similar to before.</p>\n<p>The latest guidance, which was announced yesterday, is available <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme?utm_source=Master+List&amp;utm_campaign=e3b791574b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_18_03_15_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8fc09f43fe-e3b791574b-124699807\"><strong>here</strong> </a>where full guidance will be published on 10 November 2020.</p>\n<p>Related to this, the Coronavirus Job Support Scheme (‘CJSS’), which was due to replace the furlough scheme this month, has been mothballed indefinitely and possibly may never see the light of day. However, it might come back into play at some point next year, depending how things unwind.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Coronavirus Job Retention Bonus (‘CJRB’) which offered a bonus of £1,000 per furloughed employee, whose employment was retained up to the end of January 2021, has now been shelved, due to the extension of the CJRS</p>\n<h2>Universal Credit</h2>\n<p>The removal of the minimum income floor for the self-employed, which was due to end next week, has now been extended until April 2021.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Further Support?</h2>\n<p>The above is a summary of the support available as things stand right now. Further guidance will be provided shortly, and further support may also become available. Either way, we will keep you informed as the information becomes available. If you know anyone else who might benefit from our updates, please email us their details here, assuming you have their permission to share them with us.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Fraud is Always Fraud</h2>\n<p>We are expecting to see a huge surge in checks and investigations owing to the level of fraud which HMRC believe to have occurred during the Coronavirus Support Scheme in particular with Furlough, government-backed loans and SEISS. In the market currently insurance and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-fee-protection-insurance-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">fee potential policies</a> in our industry are eye-wateringly doubling as an indication of this.</p>\n<p>Therefore, only apply for any support if you are eligible and you have been adversely impacted by Coronavirus. Fraud is still fraud, even at times like these. If you think you may have accidentally overclaimed any of the support schemes, please get in touch with us today for a non-judgemental discussion of your potential options to resolve this.</p>\n<div>\n<h2>Software Promotion</h2>\n<p>Are you interested in using Cloud-Based Accounting Software in your business but don’t currently use one?

      "content": "<p>Traditional accounting tends to focus on the past, collecting information about what’s happened in order to pay last year’s tax bill. But we prefer to look at what’s going on now for our clients and focus on the future. That’s why we’ve been doing a lot of thinking about what 2021 will bring. The CBI predicts an economic revival this year, though no full recovery until 2022. We see 2021 as a year of two parts, the first continuing to be dominated by pandemic restrictions, followed by a rapid opening up of the economic throttle as the effects of the vaccination programme are felt.</p>\n<p>We’re certainly not going to try to predict interest rate trends or what events might occur in 2021, but here are some observations on how the business environment may develop.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>More demanding customers</h2>\n<p>We all got a bit complacent pre-Covid, thinking that things would always carry on as they were, that customers would keep coming so long as we continued to do what we were doing. 2020 made everyone realise not to take anything for granted. Experts are predicting (or hoping) for a surge in consumer demand and a boom once Covid restrictions are relaxed (&#8220;bounce back&#8221;). However, we think that the customer experience is going to be more important than ever when people start spending again; consumers will shop smarter, maybe more local and expect more for their money, whether from adding value to your offer or improving the experience of doing business with you. Is your business ready to respond to these new demands? Taking a leaf out of our own book, we constantly look at how to add-value to the business services we provide. We are always looking to improve and are never happy with our progress as we can always do more.</p>\n<h2>Digital transformation</h2>\n<p>This was a pre-pandemic trend which the effects of lockdown have accelerated. Greater efficiency and productivity through digital technology will be key to survival. Internal operations will be automated; Apps and more interactive websites will reach out to customers with a better user experience; even more data will be made available to make better business decisions. Machine learning will play a growing role, but in the meantime, a more joined up approach to collating and presenting real-time data will help decision-makers, and their business advisors to respond correctly to opportunities and threats. Although its rollout is delayed for small businesses until 2022, Making Tax Digital will encourage this process as HMRC requires us all to switch to more joined-up, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">digitised bookkeeping</a> and more regular filing. And as businesses rely more on their tech and data, more investment in cybersecurity and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-recovery-and-restructure-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">business recovery</a> will be increasingly crucial to reassure customer trust.</p>\n<h2>New ways of working</h2>\n<p>Working from home&#8230; or working from anywhere? Working from home has brought benefits to both employees and employers in terms of saving time and money and we can see this trend continuing, though perhaps in a more hybrid way – we still enjoy the social interaction of the office, but do we need to travel in every day? We predict a more flexible approach to work patterns and the need to invest in faster, more secure connectivity. Now that tech has made meetings easier and quicker to arrange, we can expect a lot more of them. This might seem like an unwelcome and retrograde step at first, and for the traditional style of meeting this may be true. But gathering key stakeholders for ten minutes at short notice to work through a problem, or to approve a proposal, could save days of emails being passed up and down the approval chain. We just need to ensure that our new ways or working remain SMART.</p>\n<p>This could also lead to an interesting trend. If employees benefit from the more flexible ways of working, but their employer&#8217;s don&#8217;t share their optimism, this could lead to a big churn in the workforce (especially with many remaining in roles because of the recent climate), or people may seek different roles or even <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-start-ups/\">start up their own businesses</a>.</p>\n<h2>New business models</h2>\n<p>We believe that 2021 will see many businesses of all sizes rethink what they offer and how they deliver. This could be the age in which newer, smaller and more agile businesses thrive and take over the landscape left behind by the dinosaurs. Businesses that reacted quickly to lockdown and re-pivoted their business model thrived (business pivot), even in the hardest hit sectors such as hospitality and events. The pandemic has also made consumers more aware of their local businesses and suspicious of globalisation, which could be good news for the High Street/local businesses. Businesses are also thinking about their supply chain vulnerability to wider events beyond their control, from global lockdowns (we may see new Covid outbreaks for years to come) to the possible repercussions of Brexit. People also appear to be ready to try out new ideas; sideshows could replace your primary income as people shift from employment to self-employment with entrepreneurship soaring.</p>\n<h2>IR35</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, we have to mention this one. Whilst the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ir35-changes-delayed/\">delay to 6th April 2021</a> helped some, many had already been hit as medium and large businesses changed their recruitment in anticipation of the changes. However, this will have a big impact in 2021; it could change the way contractors work (umbrella-companies, offshoring etc).</p>\n<h2>Brexit</h2>\n<p>OK so we couldn&#8217;t discuss 2020 without mentioning B*****. Whatever side of the divide you reside, it will bring uncertainty as well as opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Don’t mention the virus!</h2>\n<p>Now that light can be seen at the end of the tunnel, at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White</a> Accounting we’re committed to looking forward and that makes us instinctively optimistic. Some big names in business have taken a hit, and familiar names have even disappeared, but those businesses that make it through this difficult time will be fitter and ready to grab new opportunities this year and the next. There are many opportunities in the current market. Are you in a good place to benefit?</p>\n<p>Personally, this will be the last time we blog about Covid-19 (we hope); our focus, along with our clients’, is now on the future.</p>\n<p>Do you have a business idea, or are you already setup and looking for some support?

Payment of your taxes is 31st January 2021, unless your tax liability is in excess of £1,000, in which case you will fall under Payment on Account so tax will be due on 31st January 2021 and 31st July 2021.</p>\n<p>Whilst the Coronavirus Support Schemes have created many concessions, the Government have resisted (to date) delaying the deadline for filing your Tax Returns, although HMRC will be open to appeals for penalties leveraged on the late filing of Tax Returns, if it was specifically caused by Coronavirus.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>If you are looking to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">file your Self-Assessment Tax Return</a> (Tax Return) yourself, here are some pointers which we hope you will find useful:</p>\n<h2>#1 &#8211; Register with HMRC</h2>\n<p>OK it might sound silly, but you cannot submit a Tax Return unless you are registered for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/dont-lose-head-tax-self-assessment-like-charles-i/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"218\">Self-Assessment</a> with HMRC and have your ten digit Unique Tax Reference (UTR). If you are unsure if you need to complete a Tax Return, please check <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa/need-tax-return.htm#1\">HMRC&#8217;s website</a>.</p>\n<h2>#2 &#8211; Have your circumstances changed? Do you still need to submit a Tax Return?</h2>\n<p>Although you may have submitted a Tax Return in the past, it doesn&#8217;t mean you need to this year, even if HMRC have sent you a notice to file letter. Check <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa/need-tax-return.htm#1\">HMRC&#8217;s website</a> to check you still need to file at Tax Return. HMRC can get in touch and inform you if they think you no longer need to submit a Tax Return, but they can only act on the information they have so won&#8217;t always know. Why expose yourself to the time spent and hassle of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">filing Tax Returns</a>, let alone the risk of penalties or assessment by completing a Tax Return unnecessarily.</p>\n<h2>#3 &#8211; Government Gateway</h2>\n<p>Assuming you are filing your Tax Return online (the deadline for filing by post is 31st October), you will need to be registered with the Government Gateway and have a note of your login and password. If you haven&#8217;t done this already, allow yourself a bit of time for HMRC to post out these details to you. You can register <a href=\"https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/\">here</a>. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset these using the same link.</p>\n<h2>#4 &#8211; Allow time</h2>\n<p>As thrilling as it is to do it last minute and get that rush (sorry Coronavirus has left us having to be more creative with our &#8220;rushes&#8221;) allow plenty of time to submit your Tax Return, especially as the Government Gateway can become very slow when lots of people are accessing it.</p>\n<p>Also the sooner your file your Tax Return, the longer you will have to save the money to pay your tax, if applicable, rather than giving yourself a last minute heart attack. This can particularly happen if you are suddenly within <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-payment-on-account/\">Payment on Account</a> when you may have to pay an additional 50% of your previous year&#8217;s bill on 31st January, followed by the same amount again on 31st July. If your income exceeds £100,000 you will also see your personal allowance eroded, so your tax bill might be more than you expect.</p>\n<p>Whilst HMRC have said that they would be as flexible as they can be due to the current Coronavirus pandemic, so will accept late filing of Tax Returns if this is the reason for it, you will still need to spend time appealing any penalties for late filing and following-up with HMRC, so we don&#8217;t recommend leaving it to the last minute in case something happens.</p>\n<h2>#5 &#8211; Claim Expenses and Allowances</h2>\n<p>To ensure you do not pay any more tax than you need to, make sure you claim all the Expenses and Allowances you can. This can include costs you have incurred wholly and exclusively for earning your income, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance\">Marriage Allowance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/working-at-home\">Use of Home</a> Allowance to name but a few.</p>\n<h2>#6 &#8211; Claim tax relief on Charitable Donations, Pension Contributions, or SEIS/EIS/VCT investments</h2>\n<p>Make sure you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">claim all the tax reliefs</a> you can. For example, have you made Charitable Donations, Pension Contributions, SEIS/EIS/VCT investments?</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t taken advantage of these for this tax year, you might want to think about this for next years tax.</p>\n<h2>#7 &#8211; Include all your sources of income</h2>\n<p>Make sure you include all your employment income, benefits-in-kind, capital gains, dividend income, bank interest, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader income</a>, partnership income, rental income and indeed any other sources of income on your Tax Return. HMRC have very sophisticated software now which performs a lot of checks behind the scenes to ensure your Tax Return is accurate and complete. It simply isn&#8217;t worth the risk of having a HMRC Check, Enquiry or the Interest and Penalties which might be incurred.</p>\n<p>Similarly for completeness, make sure you have included <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/child-benefit/\">details of Child Benefit</a> and Student Loans, if applicable.</p>\n<h2>#8 &#8211; Capital Allowances</h2>\n<p>Have you claimed all the Annual Investment Allowances you can in order to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">reduce your income tax</a>?</p>\n<p>Conversely, if your income is less than your Personal Allowance of £12,500 for 2019/20, you might want to consider reducing your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">claim for Capital Allowance</a>, so you don&#8217;t waste your Personal Allowance and instead carry it forward to future years.</p>\n<h2>#9 &#8211; Claim to reduce your Payments on Account?</h2>\n<p>If your current year income (2020/21) is significantly less than that within your 2019/20 Tax Return, consider making a claim to reduce your Payment on Account. However, only do this if your income really is going to be lower. HMRC will leverage interest if you do this and it turns out to not be accurate from when the actual Payment on Account amount should have been payable.</p>\n<h2>#10 &#8211; Seek Professional Advice</h2>\n<p>OK so we might be biased, but especially if your Tax Return is not simple, we really recommend seeking Professional Advice. To someone like us, we have countless years experience doing them day-in-day-out so this really is incomparable to someone who only does it once a year for themselves. You can end up paying a huge amount in Interest and Penalties if you file an incorrect Tax Return, not to mention the huge stress and drain on your time which you simply don&#8217;t need. Additionally you could actually pay more tax as you might not know of all the expenses, allowances or reliefs which might be available to you. Remember, our fee is tax deductible. For a more accurate, stress-free, and time-efficient Tax Return process, especially if it&#8217;s complex, seeking professional advice from a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">seasoned self-assessment accountant</a> is highly recommended. The potential savings in terms of both money and time, coupled with the assurance of avoiding costly mistakes, make it a wise investment in your financial well-being.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Whilst many submit their own Tax Returns without issue, as at today, HMRC estimate 45%, or 12.1m are still to submit theirs for 2019/20 with just 20 days to go.

However, we don&#8217;t want you to miss out.</p>\n<p>Therefore, please find below our top ten tips for you to consider to reduce the amount of tax you will end up paying in the 2020/21 tax year, if you are able to.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Use your ISA Allowance for 2020/21</h2>\n<p>The tax-free ISA allowance is £20,000. Invest before the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"134\">tax year has ended</a> as the allowance does not rollover into the next tax year.</p>\n<h2>2. Increase your children’s savings</h2>\n<p>Junior ISAs for children provide a tax-free ISA allowance of £9,000 and can be a mix of cash and shares.</p>\n<h2>3. Top up your pension</h2>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your pension allowance can reduce the amount of earnings you get taxed on</a>. You can put a maximum of £40,000 per tax year into your pension (as long as this does not exceed your relevant earnings). If you have not used your allowance this can be carried forward for up to 3 years. SEIS/EIS/VCT investments should also be considered to potentially <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">reduce your income tax</a>, as well as other taxes.</p>\n<h2>4. Use your Capital Allowance</h2>\n<p>If you need to buy a capital asset you can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">use your capital allowance</a> as a tax efficient means of doing so. Annual Investment Allowances (AIAs) are an example of a capital allowance and if an asset qualifies under the AIAs, you can deduct the full value of the item from your profits in the year in which you invest.</p>\n<h2>5. Make Charitable Donations</h2>\n<p>Tax relief on donations can be received through Gift Aid or Payroll Giving, which comes direct from your wages.</p>\n<h2>6. Take Company Dividends</h2>\n<p>To maximise your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax allowance</a>, your company can issue dividends to a maximum of £2,000 free of income tax. Your company will need to pay these before the 5th April 2021 to ensure they are included in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your self-assessment tax return</a> for 2020/21. Dividends above this are taxable at 7.5% (basic rate taxpayers), 32.5% (higher rate taxpayers) and 38.1% (additional rate taxpayers). We have assumed that you already have a PAYE scheme in place, where you don’t already use up your personal allowance with other earnings.</p>\n<p>To optimise your personal tax allowance through company dividends and ensure proper inclusion in your self-assessment tax return, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">consulting with a self-assessment accountant</a> is recommended for tailored advice.</p>\n<h2>7. Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h2>\n<p>You can make £12,300 in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">capital gains this tax year</a> before you pay tax, known as the ‘annual exemption’. If you have assets to sell or shares to dispose of, think about the timing of this. Maybe you need to consider spreading this over two tax years? You may also want to look at reinvesting the gains in order to delay any tax due. Remember, after 6th April 2020, you need to report the sale of a residential property within 30 days of disposal. Also cryptocurrency gains largely fall under CGT so you might want to consider a disposal of these too within the annual exemption.</p>\n<h2>8. Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) tax relief</h2>\n<p>If your business is involved in the advancement of science and technology, or has project(s) or activit(ies) that help resolve scientific or technological uncertainties, you may be able to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">claim R&amp;D tax credits</a>. This comes as an additional 130% deduction (in addition to the original claimed cost), or claim cash back at 14.5%, where losses are being made. This can help accelerate the growth of your business, give you much needed cashflow, or simply <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">reduce/wipe out any corporation tax</a> due. This is applied for by a report for inclusion in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">company tax returns</a>, which you can do for the current and the previous years, if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>\n<h2>9. Limit Inheritance Tax (IHT)</h2>\n<p>You can give up to £3,000 per annum worth of gifts each tax year, which will not be included in the value of your estate, known as the ‘annual exemption’, like Capital Gains Tax. Each tax year, you can also give away:<br />\na. wedding or civil ceremony gifts of up to £1,000 per person (£2,500 for a grandchild or great-grandchild, £5,000 for a child);<br />\nb. normal gifts out of your income, for example Christmas or birthday presents – as long as you can maintain your standard of living after making the gift;<br />\nc. payments to help with another person’s living costs, such as an elderly relative or a child under 18; and/or<br />\nd. gifts to charities and political parties.</p>\n<h2>10. File your tax return quickly</h2>\n<p>Complete your tax return soon after the 5th April 2021 and know what tax you need to pay and any possible refund (especially for those who pay CIS). To help you do this, keep records up to date as much as you can.</p>\n<h2>Expert tax advice in simple Black and White</h2>\n<p>Whilst we appreciate this topic is the furthest from the minds of most people as we live day-to-day in the current world, we don&#8217;t want you to forget about the allowances and reliefs available to you.</p>\n<p>If you want to talk about any of these more, we&#8217;d love to speak with you further, so please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Accounting today</a>, populate the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A deal has been done, so that there can be trade with no tariffs or quotas. However, this will not be the final position as there will be further negotiations, compromises and late-night negotiations on many topics. For example, the current deal does little for the service industry and this is a topic that will be subject to further discussions in the future.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, whilst agreement has been reached there will be differing interpretations and mistakes made. As the dust settles, more details will also emerge which will impact individuals and businesses. This isn&#8217;t helped by the fact that many government websites are being re-written and/or removed following the late agreement of the deal and some even contain incorrect information (such as saying that you may need to pay duty on imports of goods from the EU to the UK). This can make it difficult to find the necessary information.</p>\n<p>Below we discuss this in more detail and some of the key parts of the deal and how they will impact you and your business. We will continue to keep you updated here as more information comes to light and the talks continue.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_qvkzMM2G5kKF7lMM0p5dNw\">Moving goods to the EU from GB</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget, Great Britain (&#8216;GB&#8217;) refers to the whole of England, Scotland and Wales in combination, whereas the United Kingdom (&#8216;UK&#8217;), refers to Great Britain and Northern Ireland combined. This is critical here.</p>\n<p>As the UK is no longer typically in the single market it is necessary to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">complete a number of forms</a> before moving goods to GB or the UK. Similarly, goods coming to GB will require similar forms. When goods move through Kent to go to the EU it will be necessary for all truck drivers carrying out international transportation tasks to get a Kent Access Permit (&#8216;KAP&#8217;). This permit is required by both UK and non-UK drivers and whether the truck is loaded or not that are crossing the border via Dover or Eurotunnel. It is not required for domestic transport to, from, or within Kent nor for vehicles under 7.5 tonnes nor for departures from other ports. The permit is valid for 24 hours only. For more information on KAP please see the link <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-hgv-border\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To obtain the KAP it will be necessary to provide the date and time of arrival of the Heavy Goods Vehicle (&#8216;HGV&#8217;) in Kent, the registration number of the vehicle and the necessary customs documents. These customs documents will also be necessary for other transit movements even where a KAP is not required (that is in vehicles weighing less than 7.5 tonnes, or leaving via different ports).</p>\n<p>The necessary customs documents are an EU import document with a bar code. This can be an import declaration or a Transit Accompanying Document (TAD); a Movement Reference Number for the EU customs import declaration will need to be obtained. Also, an &#8216;ATA&#8217; (Admission Temporaire or Temporary Admission) or &#8216;TIR&#8217; carnet (Transport International Routier) will need to be provided. Before crossing the border, it may also be necessary to make an entry summary declaration (or safety and security declarations) into the Import Control System (&#8216;ICS&#8217;) of the EU country that is being entered and a local reference number from the shipper supplying the goods if travelling to a customs office of departure before taking the goods to the EU.</p>\n<p>Whilst most customs procedures will be paperless the Transit Accompanying Document (&#8216;TAD&#8217;) is required to accompany goods and be presented at all transit offices and at the destination. The TAD carries the Movement Reference Number (&#8216;MRN&#8217;) in both number and QR code form and the latter allows faster processing by barcode reader at transit offices. A Goods Movement Reference can be obtained <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-goods-movement-reference?utm_source=fe2d3f16-6243-4a84-8ec6-8897fa596730&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=daily\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Additional documentation will be required if transporting live animals, fish and animal products, plants or other speciality, restricted or controlled goods.</p>\n<p>Where the vehicle is less than 7.5 tonnes of is of any weight and going to the EU but not through Dover or Eurotunnel there is a service that will check that you have the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-hgv-border/check-an-hgv-is-ready-to-cross-the-border\">necessary documents to cross the border</a>. Goods exported to the EU whether through the KAP scheme, in light trucks or vans or through other ports, or by air all require the customs documentation mentioned above. Furthermore, where a driver is travelling to the EU it will be necessary to obtain a negative coronavirus test result before travel.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_479QndqUe0eo2rnRT2EfyA\">Importing goods into GB from the EU</h2>\n<p>There will be similar requirements for goods being moved into the UK; licences and import certificates may be required that were not necessary before the end of the transition period.</p>\n<p>When importing goods into the UK from the EU, it is often necessary to make a full or standard customs declaration. This requires the importer to ensure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The exporter has an EU EORI number;</li>\n<li>The exporter has the relevant export or specialist goods licences or certificates;</li>\n<li>The exporter has completed the export declaration in their country of export;</li>\n<li>The importer has a UK EORI number;</li>\n<li>The importer pays any duty necessary (it is unlikely that customs duty will be due unless the goods have originated from outside the EU, but excise duty will be due); and</li>\n<li>Import VAT is accounted for under the postponed accounting system if the importer is VAT registered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simplified customs declarations can be made through the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight system (&#8216;CHIEF system&#8217;) or the new Customs Declaration System using the EORI number for many goods, in particular ones not requiring certificates or licences.</p>\n<p>A delayed declaration can be made for goods that were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In free circulation in the EU;</li>\n<li>Imported into and in free circulation in GB;</li>\n<li>Between 1 January and 30 June 2021; and</li>\n<li>Are not controlled goods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These can be declared in a business’s own records without getting authorisation in advance. It is necessary to send HMRC full information within 175 days on a supplementary declaration. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-goods-imported-into-great-britain-from-the-eu-that-are-controlled\">Controlled goods</a> includes excise goods, controlled drugs, chemicals, endangered species, weapons, goods subject to sanctions, anti-dumping or countervailing duties and rough diamonds.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_vigm3lMuM0KgYOpiZZH9sg\">EORI number</h2>\n<p>As can be seen from the import and export rules above an EORI is vital to enable the business to interact with the customs authorities. Where a business does not have an EORI number it will meet with delays and extra costs on imports and exports. An EORI is required for the movement of goods to or from GB or the Isle of Man and other countries. The EORI number for UK businesses will start with a GB.</p>\n<p>An EORI is required for the movement of goods between GB and the EU. It is not required where the supply made is services nor where goods are moved between Northern Ireland and Ireland. An EU EORI will be needed if the business is making declarations in the EU.</p>\n<p>An EORI that starts with XI will be required to move goods between Northern Ireland and non-EU countries (including the UK) or to make a customs declaration or get a customs decision in Northern Ireland. To get an EORI that starts with XI it is necessary to already have an EORI that starts with a GB.</p>\n<p>If goods are being moved from GB to the Channel Islands an EORI starting with GB is required. Where goods are moved from the Channel Islands to GB an EORI is not necessary unless the business needs to give information to HMRC.</p>\n<p>To get an EORI an application needs to be made through the Government Gateway and the Government Gateway user ID and password must be used. The business also needs to supply its VAT number and date of VAT registration, their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> number if an individual or sole trader, the Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), their business start date and Standard Industrial Classification code (&#8216;SIC&#8217;).</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_NAXFK2SpG0qRxCZWmqJVbA\">VAT</h2>\n<p>Import VAT (including imports from the EU) can be accounted for on a business’s VAT return rather than paying it at the point of import and having to reclaim the VAT later. This allows the import VAT to be paid for on the VAT return and claimed back on the same return. The normal VAT input tax rules apply to what amount of VAT can be claimed back on the VAT return.</p>\n<p>VAT can be accounted for in this way if the import is into GB from anywhere outside the UK. An import into Northern Ireland can account for VAT on the VAT return for imports from outside the UK and the EU. There is no change of treatment to the method of accounting for VAT for the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the EU.</p>\n<p>This method of accounting for import VAT can be used where the goods are imported for use in the business and the VAT registration number of the business was included on the customs declaration. It can also be used where goods in a special customs procedure (such as customs warehousing, inward processing, outward processing or other duty suspension regimes) are moved into free circulation.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_25zDWXzz8Um_pH10fRYlDg\">VAT and overseas good sold direct to UK customers</h2>\n<p>Goods with a value of £135 or less that are outside the UK when supplied and sold directly to customers in GB will have UK VAT charged at the point of sale. It will be necessary for the supplier to register for VAT in the UK and account for VAT. Where the goods are from the UK or the EU and sold direct to customers in Northern Ireland import VAT will be charged. The £135 limit applies to the total value of the consignment not the separate value of the individual items in a consignment. Also, there are separate rules for excise goods and for non-commercial goods such as gifts.</p>\n<p>Where the consignment is valued at more than £135 the goods will be liable to import VAT and Duty. The low value relief for consignment valued at £15 has been removed in GB for goods imported from outside the UK and in Northern Ireland for goods imported from outside the UK and the EU.</p>\n<p>Goods sold by an EU business to a business in the UK are accounted for differently. Goods supplied to a customer in GB will be accounted for under the reverse charge procedure and in Northern Ireland using Postponed Accounting. The UK business will need to provide their UK VAT number to the EU business to show that they are in business.</p>\n<p>Where goods are sold through an online market place (websites and mobile phone apps) the online market place will be required to account for VAT on the supply of goods to a UK customer. In addition, a GB online market place will be required to account for VAT on sales to customers in Northern Ireland. The seller is not liable to account for the VAT on supplies through the online market place.</p>\n<p>The distance selling rules remain applicable when a business supplies and delivers goods from Northern Ireland or an EU country, to a customer in another EU country or Northern Ireland, who is not registered for VAT. This requires the supplier to register for VAT in the country where the customer is established once the value of supplies into that country exceed and annual threshold of £70,000 (some EU countries have a lower threshold). If goods subject to excise duty are sold the threshold is nil and VAT registration is required for all sales.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_qOfVS6YG6E6ZUVPm4bAmMw\">Transit movements starting or ending in Northern Ireland</h2>\n<p>A separate version of the New Computerised Transit System (&#8216;NCTS&#8217;) has been created for Northern Ireland movements using common or union transit. This is not to be used for GB transit movements. For Northern Ireland arrivals and departures, it will be necessary to make declarations by software only using e-mail or XML.</p>\n<p>If a business is starting a movement from a point of departure in Northern Ireland, a request to start a transit movement can be obtained by emailing Border Force. To obtain this it will be necessary to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name;</li>\n<li>EORI number;</li>\n<li>Local Reference Number (&#8216;LRN&#8217;) and either the Movement Reference Number (&#8216;MRN&#8217;) or Export Reference Number (&#8216;ERN&#8217;);</li>\n<li>Method of transport;</li>\n<li>Port of departure;</li>\n<li>Location of the goods until the transit movement starts; and</li>\n<li>Date and time of expected departure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a movement ends in Northern Ireland the Border Force needs to be contacted (e-mail given above) requesting an end to the transit movement. Details to be included are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name;</li>\n<li>Movement Reference Number (MRN);</li>\n<li>Method of transport;</li>\n<li>Port of arrival;</li>\n<li>Location of the goods on arrival; and</li>\n<li>Date and time of expected arrival.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, a Transit Accompanying Document (TAD) or C88, a conformation of entry into another customs procedure (such as an entry into CDS or CHIEF, and import declaration, T2L documents etc.</p>\n<p>Most goods qualify for unfettered access when moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Goods that qualify for unfettered access include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>goods in free circulation in Northern Ireland (that is not under any customs procedure); and</li>\n<li>goods processed in northern Ireland as long as all components were in free circulation in the UK.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Goods that start their journey in the EU do not qualify for unfettered access if moved through Northern Ireland into GB. These goods need to comply with customs export procedures from their point of original export and import documents for GB need to be completed.</p>\n<p>Where qualifying goods are moved from Northern Ireland to GB through Ireland the process for importing goods into the UK from the EU needs to be followed unless a transit procedure is used. For more information click <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk?utm_source=842e0b99-a173-4434-93ba-96fbfe51159e&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=daily\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_21hzYpVZbE2nU2wPjo9aDw\">Proof of origin</h2>\n<p>It will often be necessary to provide proof of origin of goods that cross borders. Without such proof the goods may be subject to delays, charges and duties. Whilst there are no tariffs on goods moving between the UK and the EU this is on the assumption that the goods are in free circulation. That means that all necessary duties and tariffs have been paid on the goods. If the goods originate in the EU or the UK there are no tariffs. Hence, providing proof of origin is important to substantiate that the goods originate in the UK or the EU. Where there are goods that originate outside the EU or UK (or where parts from outside the EU or UK are incorporated into other goods) it is important to show that any duties due have been paid.</p>\n<p>Often commercial documentation is sufficient to evidence proof of origin. This can be on the invoice, packing notes, delivery notes or on separate continuation paper. The type of proof that needs to be provided will depend upon the goods and where they are being exported from or to. The necessary information can be found in the preference agreements or the Generalised System of Preferences. The type of proof can b e a EUR1 or EUR-MED movement certificate, an origin declaration, or a Generalised Scheme of Preferences form A.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"po-heading-id_FDMMLdOnSEyzyBbXVx9xkQ\">Further information</h2>\n<p>This is by no means complete or conclusive, as even at this late stage, some of the details have yet to be confirmed/clarified.

Consider these key areas where change may be necessary:</p>\n<h3>Strategy</h3>\n<p>Strategies always need to be agile in a world of constant change, but as we move into a post-pandemic era, has the “why” of your business been affected? Will your strategy still get you to where you want to go or do you need to change how you achieve your strategic goals?</p>\n<p>Understanding how the pandemic has affected your sector, what your competitor landscape looks like and how your clients have been impacted will help you know whether you are still your delivering <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">key services</a> in a way that meets customer’s needs.</p>\n<h3>The workplace</h3>\n<p>Employee mental health has been, and remains, a concern for many employers throughout the pandemic. If you are an employer, how you manage and help your team to adapt to a new working world, with WFH likely to continue to some extent, will be critical to how you move forward.  You may also need to consider talent gaps if you find yourself moving towards a different way of working or need to change your offer.</p>\n<h3>Finance</h3>\n<p>Do you need to invest in new equipment or training to prepare for a new way of working? Are there government loans to be paid back and what should businesses be preparing for when the Government announces its next budget? If your strategy is adapting you may need to reconsider how your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2024-in-detail-what-you-need-to-know/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"98\">budget</a> is allocated and how income might be generated.</p>\n<h3>Changing customer demands</h3>\n<p>Will your customers’ behaviour and needs change again post-pandemic? Understanding this will help you decide what you need to change to support them alongside the changes you’ve already made which need to remain. We often hear how the pandemic has changed people’s perspectives and businesses shouldn’t assume the old norms will return.</p>\n<h3>Digital technologies</h3>\n<p>The pandemic has forced many businesses to speed up their digital strategies to meet the needs of working during a pandemic. Building digital strategies into your post-pandemic business will ensure you keep pace with digital evolution within your market.</p>\n<p>The pandemic will come to an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"170\">end and this will allow businesses to plan</a> for a brighter future, rather than react to circumstances.

      "content": "<p>Today HMRC announced that whilst the delayed IR35 changes will come into effect from 6 April 2021, there will be a &#8216;soft landing&#8217; as part of their compliance strategy.</p>\n<p>Whilst many were hoping for a U-Turn or further deferral here due to the unprecedented times, it appears HMRC are looking to implement the planned changes in the next six weeks, which were originally planned for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ir35-changes-delayed/\">6 April 2020.</a></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>What is IR35?</h2>\n<p>IR35, or Intermediaries Legislation, is used to describe the tax legislation designed to combat the tax avoidance by contractors/freelance workers and the firms that hire them, typically via an intermediary such as a limited company (sometimes called a ‘Personal Service Company’), who would be employees and pay tax via PAYE, were it not for the intermediary. These ‘deemed employees’ have to pay Income Tax and National Insurance, as if they were employees, if HMRC deem them to be within the legislation, which would have a significant impact on their incomes. Confusingly IR35 is used to refer to all this legislation, past, present and future.</p>\n<p>Whilst the legislation has been in place since April 2000, it is regarded as poorly conceived and badly implemented by HMRC, which causes unnecessary costs and hardships for other genuine businesses. The government therefore tried to refresh the legislation for the Public Sector in 2017 and this was proposed to be extended to medium and large firms in the private sector from April 2020, before it was delayed. This is however now coming into effect from 6 April 2021. Medium and large firms are defined as having two or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>turnover of more than £10.2 million;</li>\n<li>balance sheet total or more than £5.1 million; and / or</li>\n<li>50 or more employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These private sector firms will see a shifting of responsibility for determining the tax status of the contractor from the service provider to the client business. If a contractor was considered a “deemed employee” the client business would then be responsible for processing payments through their payroll making all necessary tax and NI deductions rather than the contractor doing this themselves, unless of course they chose to operate through an Umbrella company.</p>\n<h2>How do you know if IR35 rules apply?</h2>\n<p>It is recommended that you look at the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax\">Check Employment Status for Tax tool</a> (or &#8216;CEST&#8217;). While this tool is not perfect, it provides good guidance as to what HMRC are looking for to determine if a person is an employee or contractor. HMRC are also seeking to make further improvements to it, in advance of the changes on 6 April 2021.</p>\n<p>The type of indicators that need to be considered when determining IR35 status are the usual ones in determining if a person is an employee or independent. i.e.,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where the contractor has a right to substitute another person for his or her own services, this is seen as a strong indicator that the relationship is contractor and customer rather than employer and employee.</li>\n<li>Where the client has significant control and direction over the worker this will be seen as an employee and employer relationship. Conversely, where the worker has control over how the job or assignment is completed this is seen as a contractor/client relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HMRC also look for what is called mutuality of obligations. That is, is there an obligation to provide and accept work between the parties? This is an area of dispute between HMRC and many practitioners, and can be difficult to determine with confidence.</p>\n<h2>Compliance Principles</h2>\n<p>HMRC have spent the last twelve months developing their compliance strategy. Their Principles will underpin the way HMRC support individuals and businesses to comply and how they will intervene, where they suspect non-compliance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support customers who are trying to do the right thing and comply with the rules;</li>\n<li>Help customers meet their responsibilities under the off-payroll working rules;</li>\n<li>Where customers make a mistake, they will help them correct it and check they are corrected;</li>\n<li>Identify and correct non-compliance with the off-payroll working rules;</li>\n<li>Challenge deliberately non-compliant customers and tax avoidance schemes; and</li>\n<li>Have a specialist team specifically to carry out off-payroll working compliance activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More information can be found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-issue-briefing-supporting-organisations-to-comply-with-changes-to-the-off-payroll-working-rules-ir35/hmrc-issue-briefing-supporting-organisations-to-comply-with-changes-to-the-off-payroll-working-rules-ir35\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Soft Landing</h2>\n<p>Today, HMRC confirmed that companies will not have to pay penalties on any inaccuracies within the first 12 months of the new rules coming into effect, unless there is “clear evidence of deliberate non-compliance”.</p>\n<p>The aim is to help companies implement the new rules while also recognising the difficulties they may be under as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>However, “deliberate defaulters” will be named and shamed to encourage them to get their “tax affairs in order”. For this reason, the Government has urged businesses not to cut corners when introducing these new rules.</p>\n<h2>Need IR35 advice?</h2>\n<p>If you would like to talk through the overall principals, changes coming into place, have an IR35 review, our specialist team of business advisers is ready to help; <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a> today, complete the ‘Got a Question’ form on the right hand side, or call us on 0800 140 4644.</p>\n<p>Why not sign up to our newsletter using the link below, or follow us across <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blackandwhiteacc/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bandwaccountants/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/black-&amp;-white-chartered-certified-accountants/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BandWAccounting\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhv1r4djc0ZoqPt-M_mcrg\">YouTube</a> to be kept up to date with IR35 and other changes?</p>\n",

Since the launch in May 2020 over a million loans have been issued. For more details of who you can borrow and for more information about the scheme please go to the <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/\">British Business Bank Website</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the key highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capped at 25% of turnover, you can borrow between £2,000 and £50,000. This is usually based on 2019 numbers, although new business can use forecasts;</li>\n<li>There are no interest or repayments in the first 12 months. After this period, interest is chargeable at 2.5%;</li>\n<li>You can repay it early without penalty. Several of our clients have taken it out for this reason, just in case, but will look to repay it before interest is payable, if they don&#8217;t need it;</li>\n<li>These loans are unsecured and credit ratings will not affect eligibility. The loan will go on your business credit report, but not a personal one;</li>\n<li>You can apply for the bounce back loan through your bank and there are <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2020/05/small-business-boost-as-bounce-back-loans-launched/#bankbybank\">many banks</a> still offering them; and</li>\n<li>They won&#8217;t affect your eligibility for other Government Support, although you cannot take out a Bounce Back, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS), you have to choose just one of these.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>&#8216;New&#8217; News</h2>\n<p>Since it was first announced the following improvements have been made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial deadline of 30 November 2020 has been extended to 31 March 2021 (unless it is extended again).

This has now been extended to 10 years, which can almost half monthly repayments. However, it can be repaid early at any time without paying a penalty;</li>\n<li>You can now ask for the period before you start paying this back to be extended from 12 months to 18. However, interest will still kick in from 12 months; and</li>\n<li>You can move the interest-only payments temporarily up to three times, with interest-only payment lasting up to six months.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>*Budget 2021 Update</h2>\n<p>In the Budget announcement on 3 March 2021, Rishi Sunak confirmed that the Bounce Back Loan will be closing on 31 March 2021.

      "content": "<p>Almost 12 months ago, we posted a blog noting the changes coming in Capital Gains Tax (&#8216;CGT&#8217;) which took effect from <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax-changes-coming-6th-april-2020/\">6 April 2020</a>. However, we are constantly having conversations with individuals selling residential properties who are completely unaware of the changes. We therefore thought it would useful to recap these changes, to raise awareness.</p>\n<p>The changes were designed to raise additional tax when individuals dispose of residential properties, more quickly, to bring a one-off additional yield of £5-8bn of tax revenue. We&#8217;ll see how that worked out for the Government shortly, but the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-ated-and-stamp-duty-land-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Stamp Duty</a> Holiday probably helped the property market keep moving, at least in the short-term.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Capital Gains Tax on residential property</h2>\n<p>If you, as an individual or partnership, sell a property in the UK, you may need to pay CGT on any profits made, subject to certain exemptions, including the property being your main home (‘Principal Residence Relief’). This is commonly the case for example, when you sell a second home, or buy-to-let property.</p>\n<p>The capital gain is the difference between the disposal proceeds and the cost of acquiring the property and improving it, which is then taxed at the relevant tax rate after any annual exemption (£12,300 in 2020/21 per individual, but see our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Ftax-rates-and-allowances%2Fcapital-gains-tax\">rates</a> page for more details). Individuals pay CGT on residential properties at 18% or 28% depending on whether they are standard or higher rate tax payers, factoring in any <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">capital gains will be included when working out your tax</a> status for the year, and may push you into a higher bracket. With other assets, the basic-rate of CGT is 10%, and the higher-rate is 20%.</p>\n<h3>Earlier payment of CGT on residential property</h3>\n<p>This change, originating from George Osborne, but whose implementation was initially delayed, essentially strips out the initial computation of any gain from the self-assessment system and makes it a standalone report and payment, although self-assessment taxpayers will continue to also report the gain on their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>, for all residential property sales after 6th April 2020. The result is any tax on the gain will need to be paid within 30 days of the transaction, rather than in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax return</a> of the individual who owns the property, which would be 10 to 22 months after the chargeable event, or completion date. For a comprehensive understanding and effective management of these alterations, consulting with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">seasoned self-assessment accountant</a> is advisable.</p>\n<h3>Returns, Amendments, Enquiries and Payment</h3>\n<p>A return must be filed within 30 days of the date of disposal, including a declaration by the person making it that the return is to the best of the person’s knowledge correct and complete. However, this return is not required for ‘no gain-no loss’ disposals, nor for disposals where no tax is due. Available capital losses can be utilised to reduce any tax due, subject to the usual rules.</p>\n<p>Where there is more than one disposal in a year, the tax is calculated after each disposal, factoring in the previous disposals in the year, so the cumulative <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">amount of Capital Gains Tax</a> is calculated each time a disposal is made, with the net tax due (overpaid) due for payment (refund).</p>\n<p>The usual 12 month period for amending returns remains, but they can only be amended in respect of events that have already occurred at the date the return was delivered.</p>\n<p>The usual enquiry windows will also apply and if a self-assessment tax return is enquired into, it is deemed that any gains shown within that return will also be deemed under enquiry.</p>\n<p>The payment is also <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculated</a> and due to be paid within 30 days of the date of disposal. The amount paid is referred to as a payment on account of the CGT for that year, as it is effectively an interim payment of Capital Gains Tax with the final calculation of the total CGT liability being performed, as usual, through the self assessment system, at least for now.</p>\n<h2>CGT on Principal Residence Relief</h2>\n<p>Generally, you won’t pay Capital Gains Tax when selling the property you live in, due to the ‘Principal Residence Relief’.</p>\n<p>Provided the property genuinely has been your main home at some point, you won’t need to pay capital gains tax for the time it was your main residence, plus the past 18 months of ownership (even if you weren’t living in the property during those 18 months). People with a disability or those who move into a care home can claim for up to the past 36 months of ownership.</p>\n<p>Examples of when you might still get a CGT bill include when you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert part of it into flats;</li>\n<li>When you use part of your home exclusively for business;</li>\n<li>Bought a home for the purpose of doing it up and selling it on;</li>\n<li>Let out all or part of your home (excluding having a single lodger when you live in the property as well);</li>\n<li>Sell part of the garden or your total plot, if the area you’re selling, is more than half a hectare (1.2 acres); and/or</li>\n<li>Where you moved out of the property 18 months or more ago (soon to be 9 months, as below), for example to move into a partner’s home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to Principal Residence Relief</h3>\n<p>From 6th April 2020, private residence relief applied to the time you lived in the home, plus the final 9 months of ownership – instead of the final 18 months. However, people who move into a care home, or have a disability could still claim for the last 36 months of ownership. People will still be able to claim private residents relief for any period where the property was their main home.</p>\n<h2>Rental Relief on Capital Gains Tax</h2>\n<p>If you have let out part or all of your home, a proportion of any gain when you sell it could be taxable. But if you used to live in the property, you may be able to claim letting relief, which will reduce your capital gains tax bill. Letting relief doesn’t apply to buy-to-let investors who let out their properties and never live in them.</p>\n<p>Currently, the amount of letting relief you can claim will be the lowest of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The gain you receive from the letting proportion of the home;</li>\n<li>The amount of private residence relief you can claim; or</li>\n<li>£40,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note you cannot claim private residence relief and letting relief for the same period. This means if you are letting the property out when you come to sell, the past 18 months of ownership (soon to be 9 months) qualify for private residence relief rather than letting relief. The exact amount of private residence relief and letting relief you can get depends on the amount you sell the property for.</p>\n<h3>Letting Relief ‘Abolition’</h3>\n<p>From 6th April 2020, rental relief was scaled back so it is only available for people who were in shared occupancy with a tenant. Anyone who has lived in a property and now rents it out is likely to be hit by this change and, as a result, could face a larger capital gains tax bill.</p>\n<h2><strong>Black and White Accounting</strong></h2>\n<p>Although we love calculating it, CGT is unfortunately not an easy tax to get your head around.

      "content": "<p>HMRC’s new Domestic Reverse Charge for the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">Construction Sector</a> comes into force from today, 1 March 2021. As you may know from our previous blogs, it was originally planned to come into force in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vat-changes-in-construction/\">October 2019</a>, until this was pushed back until <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction-vat-delayed/\">October 2020</a> to enable more time for the sector to prepare for the change. Then the pandemic came along and this was extended by a further five months to 1 March 2021. However, this date is now upon us and no further delays have been announced.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Below we summarise the rules, but we note they are far from simple, so please take the time to understand them and ensure you apply them, so you don&#8217;t end up paying too little or too much VAT.</p>\n<h2>What is it and who does it apply to?</h2>\n<p>The VAT Domestic Reverse Charge for services is a change in how VAT is handled for certain parts of the UK <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">Construction services</a>. The scheme means that those supplying <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">Construction services</a> to a VAT-registered customer will no longer have to account for the VAT. Instead, the customer will account for the VAT, thus falling on those with the &#8220;widest shoulders&#8221;. The customer will effectively both pay and reclaim the VAT at the same time.</p>\n<p>In simpler terms, for services they provide, sub-contractors will require the contractor employing them to handle and pay the VAT directly to HMRC. This will apply to standard VAT rate supplies and reduced VAT rate supplies (e.g., installing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vat-builders/energy-mobility\">energy saving products and certain work for people over 60</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-708-buildings-and-construction/vat-notice-708-buildings-and-construction#reduced-rating-the-conversion-of-premises-to-a-different-residential-use\">converting a building into a house or flats</a> or from one residential use to another, renovating an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-708-buildings-and-construction/vat-notice-708-buildings-and-construction#reduced-rating-the-renovation-or-alteration-of-empty-residential-premises\">empty house or flat</a>). It will not apply to zero-rated supplies (e.g., building a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vat-builders/new-homes\">new house or flat</a> or work for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vat-builders/disabled-people\">disabled people</a> in their home).</p>\n<h2>Subcontractor &#8211; What do you need to do?</h2>\n<p>At the moment you usually add VAT at 20% to your sales invoices, if you are VAT registered. From 1 March 2021, if you issue an invoice to a Contractor in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">Construction</a> chain of events you no longer add VAT, you must state on the invoice what the VAT amount or rate should have been and that the invoice falls within Reverse Charge rules e.g. ‘’Reverse Charge: S55 VATA 94 applies’’</p>\n<p>You have to consider what services you are supplying and to whom, as you won&#8217;t always exclude the VAT, it will depend on the specific transaction.</p>\n<h2>Contractors &#8211; What do you need to do?</h2>\n<p>Usually your subcontractors will issue you with invoices, with VAT on, if they are VAT registered. However, from 01 March 2021, it is likely that most of them will not have VAT on them, but state Reverse Charge rules apply (see above).</p>\n<p>You must enter the invoice as if it has VAT on it, even though it doesn’t. It might sound silly, how can I reclaim the VAT on an invoice when I haven’t paid it? The answer is you cannot. Therefore, at the same time you must enter an equivalent amount of output/sales VAT, so the two VAT amounts cancel down to zero. You must enter VAT only in your accounts i.e. that ultimately reports as output tax in box 1 of the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">VAT return</a>, DO NOT also enter any figures as sales which report as Box 6 in your VAT return.</p>\n<p>This might be a great opportunity for you to use a MTD-compliant software, such as Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent or Sage, to make this process as simple as possible for you, if you are not already. Book keeping spreadsheets and bridging software may no longer be the answer.</p>\n<h2>Key things to consider</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Am I registered for VAT and involved in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">Construction industry</a>?;</li>\n<li>Will this invoice I am producing be after 01 March 2021?;</li>\n<li>Is the person I am invoicing a contractor in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">Construction Sector</a>? (e.g. if you are completing work for a homeowner or the ultimate property owner, they are not);</li>\n<li>Are the services I am supplying on the list of Reverse Charge services, so the whole invoice has no VAT?;</li>\n<li>Did I put the ‘Reverse Charge: S55 VATA 94 applies’ statement on my invoice, if applicable?;</li>\n<li>Have I received an invoice with this statement? Remember to add VAT and an equivalent amount of sales/output VAT;</li>\n<li>Did I read the detailed rules, in case there is something in there that impacts on me?; and</li>\n<li>Is my <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">bookkeeping package</a> (or MTD-compliant software) capable of coping with this new change?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<p>This is only a very simple summary of the new rules. The full HMRC guidance can be found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-domestic-reverse-charge-for-building-and-construction-services\">here</a>, if you are so inclined.

      "content": "<p>Today Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out the Government’s tax and spending plan for the year ahead. We cover the impact from individuals, self-employed and small company owners in detail below. We have also done a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2021-quick-summary/\">quick summary</a>, in case this is easier for you to digest. This is based on what we know today and as always the devil is in the detail and more information will come to light as the dust settles. We will of course keep you updated.</p>\n<h2><!--more-->Impact on individuals</h2>\n<h3>Personal allowance and income tax thresholds frozen</h3>\n<p>The personal allowance is increased in line with inflation to £12,570 for 2021/22. However, it will remain at this level for the next five years, until April 2026. The basic rate band will also remain at £37,700 for the next five years, freezing the starting point for paying higher rate at £50,270 until April 2026.</p>\n<p>If your income increases during this period, for example, your pay rises in line with inflation, you may find that you move into the higher rate band, paying <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">tax on some of your income</a> at 40% where previously you were a basic rate taxpayer.</p>\n<p>The basic <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">rate of tax</a> will remain at 20%, the higher rate at 40% and the additional rate at 45%.</p>\n<h3>Covid support continues</h3>\n<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is extended until 30 September 2021. This means that if you have been furloughed or flexibly furloughed, you will continue to be paid 80% of your normal wages for your unworked hours, subject to the cap of £2,500 per month.</p>\n<p>If you are self-employed and your business has been adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, you will be able to claim two further grants under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme.</p>\n<h3>Pension lifetime allowance frozen</h3>\n<p>The pension lifetime allowance will not be increased in line with inflation over the next five years. Instead, it will remain at its current level of £1,073,100 for 2021/22 to 2025/26. This may affect you if you already have pension savings at or near this level. If this is the case, you should review the amount of your pension pot before making further tax-relieved contributions.</p>\n<p>Pension savings more than the lifetime allowance are taxed at 25% if the excess is taken as a pension, and at 55% if it is taken as a lump sum.</p>\n<h3>SDLT threshold to remain at £500,000 until 30 June 2021</h3>\n<p>The temporary increase in the SDLT threshold to £500,000 will remain in place until 30 June 2021. It will then fall to £250,000 until 30 September 2021, returning to the standard amount of £125,000 from 1 October 2021. If you are looking to move to a new house or to buy an investment property, there is still time to benefit from the higher threshold.</p>\n<p>These comments refer to rates in England and Northern Ireland, the devolved administrations of Wales and Scotland may set alternative rates.</p>\n<h3>Inheritance tax nil rate band to remain at £325,000</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">inheritance tax</a> nil rate band will remain at its current level of £325,000 until April 2026. The residence nil rate band, available where your main residence is left to a direct descendant, also remains at its current level of £175,000 until April 2026. This should be considered when undertaking <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/inheritance-tax/\">inheritance tax planning</a>.</p>\n<h2>Impact on the self-employed</h2>\n<h3>Two further grants available under the SEISS</h3>\n<p>If you are self-employed and you continue to be adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, you will be able to claim two further grants under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS).</p>\n<p>The fourth grant under the scheme covers February to April 2021. It is worth three months’ average profits capped at £7,500. It can be claimed from late April.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final grant covers the period from May to September 2021. The amount of the grant will depend on the impact that Covid-19 has had on your profits. If your turnover has fallen by 30% or more because of Covid-19, you will be able to claim a grant equal to 80% of your average profits for three months, capped at £7,500. However, if your turnover has dropped by less than 30%, you will be entitled to a reduced grant of 30% of three months’ average profits, capped at £2,880. The final grant can be claimed from late July.</p>\n<p>Remember, you can only claim the grant if you have been adversely affected by the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Grants received under the scheme are taxable and must be considered in working out your profits.</p>\n<h3>Help for the newly self-employed</h3>\n<p>Support under the SEISS was not available to traders who commenced self-employment in 2019/20 – to qualify <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> had to be filed for 2018/19. However, as the deadline for filing the 2019/20 tax return has now passed, you may be eligible for the fourth and fifth grants if your 2019/20 tax return was filed by midnight on 2 March 2021. To qualify, your business must be adversely affected by the pandemic and your profits from self-employment must be at least 50% of your income and less than £50,000.</p>\n<h3>Carry-back period for losses extended</h3>\n<p>The period for which losses may be carried back is temporarily extended from one year to three years. For unincorporated businesses, the extended carry-back will apply to losses made in 2020/21 and 2021/22. Losses must be set against a later period before an earlier period.</p>\n<p>If you have suffered losses due to Covid-19, carrying back losses for up to three years may generate a most welcome tax repayment.</p>\n<h2>Impact on small companies</h2>\n<h3>Tax-efficient extraction of profits</h3>\n<p>For 2021/22, the primary threshold for Class 1 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> purposes increases to £9,568, the secondary threshold to £8,840 and the personal allowance to £12,570.</p>\n<p>If you extract profits by taking a mix of salary and dividends, the optimal salary level for 2021/22 (assuming you have not used your personal allowance elsewhere) will be equal to the primary threshold of £9,568 (equivalent to £797 a month) if you are not entitled to the employment allowance. This will be the case if you are a personal company with only one employee who is also a director. At this level, you will have a little bit of employer’s National Insurance to pay, but this will be outweighed by the associated <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax deduction</a>.</p>\n<p>If you can claim the employment allowance, for example, if your company is a family company with at least two employees, the optimal salary for 2021/22 is equal to the personal allowance of £12,570.</p>\n<p>Any further profits can be extracted as dividends but remember you can only pay dividends if you have sufficient retained profits to pay them from. Dividend tax rates remain at 7.5%, 32.5% and 38.1% for 2021/22.</p>\n<h3>Three-year carry back for losses</h3>\n<p>Companies, like unincorporated businesses, can benefit from a measure allowing losses to be carried back for three years, rather than for one year. For companies, this applies to losses incurred in accounting periods ending between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 and to losses for accounting periods ending between 1 April 2021 and 30 March 2022. Losses carried back must be used against a later period before an earlier period.</p>\n<p>This measure may provide you with earlier relief for losses suffered because of the Covid-19 pandemic and generate a useful tax repayment at a time where cash flow is tight.</p>\n<h3>Super-deduction for investment expenditure</h3>\n<p>Companies that invest in plant and machinery in the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023 will be able to benefit from <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">enhanced capital allowances</a>. Investments in assets that qualify for the main rate of capital allowances of 18% will benefit from a 130% first-year allowance. This means that for every £100 that you spend, you can deduct £130 in computing your taxable profits. This is equivalent to a tax saving of 24.7%.</p>\n<p>Investments in assets qualifying for special rate capital allowances benefit from a 50% first year allowance (although claiming the annual investment allowance instead where this is available will be more beneficial).</p>\n<p>If you are looking to invest in plant and machinery, it can be advantageous to do so within this window to benefit from the super-deduction. However, it is not available where contracts were agreed before Budget day.</p>\n<h3>Future increases in corporation tax</h3>\n<p>To help meet some of the costs of the pandemic, companies with profits of £250,000 or more will pay corporation tax at a rate of 25% from 1 April 2023. A lower rate of 19% will apply to companies with profits of £50,000 or less. Companies with profits of between £50,000 and £250,000 will pay corporation tax at the 25% but will be able to claim marginal relief. The thresholds will be proportionately reduced to take account of associated companies and short accounting periods.</p>\n<h3>Extension of the Coronavirus job Retention Scheme</h3>\n<p>If you have furloughed or flexibly furloughed employees, you will be able to continue to claim grant support under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme until the end of September.<br />\nUntil the end of June, you can claim 80% of your employee’s normal pay for their unworked hours, subject to the cap of £2,500. However, while your employees must continue to receive 80% of their normal pay for their furloughed hours, you can only claim 70% from the Government in July and 60% in August and September. You must pay the remaining 10% in July and the remaining 20% August and September. As now, you must meet the employer’s National Insurance and employer pension contributions on all payments to employees.</p>\n<p>The scheme will come to an end on 30 September 2021.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>At this most difficult of times, we are doing everything we can to help and support as many people as possible, for example by keeping them up to date with all the latest news and support schemes as we have done here.

We&#8217;d love to hear your feedback and thoughts.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>These are the top 10 reasons we LOVE FreeAgent, although we could have added a lot more&#8230;</p>\n<h3>1. Simple and User-friendly</h3>\n<p>Our team understands being a small business owner comes with challenges unique to the size and function of the business.

Being stretched in all directions leaves little time to be spent poring over accounting software to understand the nitty gritty details. That is why we believe FreeAgent is a great tool. It’s easy to use and the best part is you need little &#8211; if any &#8211; accounting knowledge to navigate the software. Some of the software solutions on the market are just too complicated for simple businesses, which is why FreeAgent can be a great solution.</p>\n<p>FreeAgent is the total package for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">small businesses such as freelancers</a>, contractors and consultants.

Not only that, <a href=\"https://www.mettle.co.uk/features/get-freeagent-for-free/\">Mettle</a> business bank account holders can also get it for free now. Shhh don&#8217;t tell anyone, but you can even just open a Mettle business bank account quickly and easily to get FreeAgent for free. In the current climate especially this can be a big help for SMEs.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>3. Overview of your business’ finances</h3>\n<p>As soon as you log in to your FreeAgent account you have a clear summary of your business account balances, Cashflow for the year, Invoice timeline and any recent expenses/bills. No messy spreadsheets or confusing accounting jargon. Just a simple, easy-to-read overview.</p>\n<h3>4. Get a clear view of project profitability</h3>\n<p>Scribbling your to-do lists and notes on Post-its and scraps of papers? It is so easy to lose them, right? That’s a thing of the past with FreeAgent. You can manage complex projects with ease – build to-do lists for your projects and then track your time against each task. Recording all project income, time and expenses in one place allows you to manage and have a clear view of project profitability.</p>\n<h3>5. Access your business records from anywhere, at anytime</h3>\n<p>You can take care of business wherever you are with FreeAgent’s mobile accounting app that is available on iOS and Android. The mobile app has handy features such as Capture for later, tracking time on the go (for important meetings), tracking mileage whilst on the road and creating, sending and managing invoices, as well as many more. Managing your finances has never been easier, where you have wi-fi you can know exactly how your business is performing.</p>\n<h3>6. Bank feeds allow efficient and accurate data-entry</h3>\n<p>FreeAgent has various different features which allow you to automate data-entry. By setting up a bank feed, you can import transactions through daily. This allows our team to keep up to date with your banking without having to chase you for statements.</p>\n<p>FreeAgent also has a Guess feature which attempts to automatically explain your bank transactions. Guess has been enhanced with machine learning algorithms which can automatically categorise new transactions. This enables us to spend less time on explaining transactions and more time on saving you money!</p>\n<h3>7. ‘Capture for Later’ feature makes recording expenses a whole lot easier!</h3>\n<p>So picture this … you popped out to grab a coffee yesterday with a potential client. Accidentally paid with your personal card instead of your business card. But not to worry, you can claim that back as a business expense. Just remember to hold on to your receipt. Oh wait. Now where has that receipt disappeared to? Ah, probably crumpled and soggy … in the washing machine.</p>\n<p>Next time, use the ‘Capture for Later’ feature on the FreeAgent mobile app. You can capture and store receipt images on the go so that all of your out-of-pocket expenses are safe and sound in one place. No need to panic the next time you misplace a receipt!</p>\n<h3>8. Create and Send Invoices with ease</h3>\n<p>Invoicing from within FreeAgent enables you to have full visibility of when invoices were raised and sent.

      "content": "<p>After Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out the Government’s tax and spending plan in the 2021 Budget last week, we wanted to keep you updated with all the key information you need to know for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>Most of the changes announced last week, will not impact the current tax year, but future ones. However, there are changes coming in from previous budgets which now start in April 2021, the main points of which are summarised below.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Budget itself, please see our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2021-quick-summary/\"><strong>summary </strong></a>and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2021-how-will-it-affect-you/\"><strong>detailed </strong></a>blogs. As always, the devil is in the detail and more information will come to light as the dust settles.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<div>\n<h2>Coronavirus Support Schemes</h2>\n<h3>Furlough Scheme Extension</h3>\n<p>The government is extending the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (‘CJRS’) for a further five months from May until the end of September 2021.</p>\n<p>Employees will continue to receive 80% of their current salary for hours not worked.</p>\n<p>There will be no employer contributions beyond <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance contributions (NICs)</a> and pensions required in April, May and June.</p>\n<p>From July, the government will introduce an employer contribution towards the cost of unworked hours of 10% in July, 20% in August and 20% in September, as the economy reopens.</p>\n<h3>Self-employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)</h3>\n<p>The government confirmed that the fourth SEISS grant will be worth 80% of three months’ average trading profits, paid out in a single instalment and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>\n<p>The grant will cover the period February to April and can be claimed from late April. Self-employed individuals must have filed a 2019- 20 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self-Assessment tax return</a> to be eligible for the fourth grant. For personalised guidance on eligibility and the application process for the fourth SEISS grant, self-employed individuals are advised to consult with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">professional self-assessment accountant</a>.</p>\n<p>This means that over 600,000 individuals may be newly eligible for SEISS, including many new to self-employment in 2019-20. All other eligibility criteria will remain the same as the third grant.</p>\n<p>The government also announced that there will be a fifth and final SEISS grant covering May to September. The value of the grant will be determined by a turnover test, to ensure that support is targeted at those who need it the most as the economy reopens.</p>\n<p>People whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will continue to receive the full grant worth 80% of three months’ average trading profits, capped at £7,500. People whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a 30% grant, capped at £2,850. The final grant can be claimed from late July.</p>\n<h3>Bounce Back Loan and Recovery Loan</h3>\n<p>The government have confirmed that the Bounce Back Loan scheme will end by 31 March 2021. However, there will be a new state-backed ‘recovery loan’ available for all viable businesses hit by the pandemic, for legitimate business purposes. Full details will follow, but we currently understand that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loans and overdrafts of between £25,000 and £10m;</li>\n<li>Asset/invoice finance from £1,000 to £10m;</li>\n<li>Unsecured finance of up to £250,000;</li>\n<li>You’ll be able to apply, even if you have a bounce back loan.</li>\n<li>Terms will be up to six years for loans and asset finance, and up to three years for overdrafts and invoice finance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this stage we don’t know the interest rate, whether there will be a credit check, or whether they will be available for sole traders and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited companies</a> etc. However, we will update you as soon as we hear anything further. More information of this can be found in our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/bounce-back-loans-update/\"><strong>blog</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>VAT</h3>\n<p>You may be able to further defer VAT payments as detailed in our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/coronavirus-vat-deferral-scheme/\"><strong>blog</strong></a>. The portal is now open for applications to defer 2020 VAT payments due by 31 March 2021 until March 2022. Further details can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferral-of-vat-payments-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19#join-the-vat-deferral-new-payment-scheme\"><strong>GOV.UK</strong></a>. Applications must be submitted by 21 June 2021. Unfortunately, we are unable to do this for you even if we are your agents.</p>\n<h3>Stamp Duty Land Tax</h3>\n<p>The government will extend the temporary increase in the residential SDLT Nil Rate Band to £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland until 30 June 2021.</p>\n<p>From 1 July 2021, the Nil Rate Band will reduce to £250,000 until 30 September 2021 before returning to £125,000 on 1 October 2021.</p>\n<h2>Important Changes from April 2021</h2>\n<h3>Businesses</h3>\n<h4>Corporation Tax</h4>\n<p>This remains at 19%, but will increase after 1 April 2023:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will change from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023.</li>\n<li>This higher rate will apply where company profits are in excess of £250,000, with the low rate of 19% being retained for those with profits under £50,000. For those companies with profits between £50,000 and £250,000, there will be marginal relief applied to bridge the gap between the lower and upper limits.</li>\n<li>These limits will be divided by the number of associated companies; in other words, where one company controls another or both are under the same control. There are increased tax allowances from April 2021 (the “super-deduction”) on certain classes of assets that can be claimed, which will reduce the Company tax by around 25p for every pound invested in qualifying new equipment, and which we will claim as part of the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a> work we do for you.</li>\n<li>Companies making trading losses in 2020/21 and/or 2021/2022 will be able to carry back these losses for up to three years to offset against taxable profits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Company Directors<strong><br />\n</strong></h4>\n<p>Setting the best level for your salary for 21/22:</p>\n<p>The two most tax efficient options for the current year are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£9,568 (up from £9,504) gross per annum; or</li>\n<li>£12,570 (up from £12,500) gross per annum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is based on you having no other sources of income. If you have any other income sources, please let us know so <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">we can calculate</a> the best scenario for you.</p>\n<p>Please note for 20/21 if you have claimed furlough, make sure you have topped up your salary for the year up to the lower earning limit, to ensure you get the national insurance credit for the year if you haven’t already done so. Where we do your payroll, we will be in touch with you, specifically on this.</p>\n<h4>Dividend Tax</h4>\n<p>If your salary is now £797.34 per month you can then take £5,002 of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/dividend-tax-calculator/\">dividends per annum</a> tax free. There is then tax payable at 7.5% on the next £35,700 of dividends. The dividend tax rate then increases to 32.5%.</p>\n<p>If your salary is £1,017.48 per month you can then take £2,000 dividends per annum tax free. There is then tax payable at 7.5% on the next £35,700 of dividends. The dividend tax rate then increases to 32.5%.</p>\n<p>If you have other income this will reduce the bandings accordingly<strong>. </strong>The 32.5% band continues until your total income reaches £100k then the % rises again, as noted below.</p>\n<h4>Top Tax Director/Shareholder Tips to Consider</h4>\n<p>If you have not already, you may want to transfer some shares, or adding payroll for your spouse or family members to reduce dividend tax.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-are-alphabet-shares-everything-you-need-to-know/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"117\">Alphabet shares</a> can also be a good option if they are setup correctly.</p>\n<p>If you are the sole director/employee and take on another employee who is paid at the level where NIC is due, you should increase your salary to £12,570 per annum as this will reduce taxes as you can claim the Employer’s NI allowance.</p>\n<h4>Construction Industry and VAT</h4>\n<p>This was scheduled to begin in October 2019 was delayed a year and took effect from 1 March 2021.</p>\n<p>Here a person supplying certain <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">construction industry services</a> to a VAT-registered customer will no longer be required to charge VAT. Instead, the customer will account for VAT under a “reverse charge” arrangement. That is, the customer will account for VAT as if they had made the supply (to themselves) and will also, if and to the extent appropriate, recover the same VAT as input tax. HMRC have introduced this so the burden falls on those with the widest shoulders and to minimise VAT fraud.</p>\n<p>It applies only to supplies which would otherwise be subject to VAT at the standard or reduced rate. It does not, for example, apply to zero-rated supplies or supplies made by someone who is neither registered nor required to be registered for VAT.</p>\n<p>The list of services to which the CSDRC applies (“construction services”) has a familiar ring—they are the same services as those to which the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">Income Tax</a> Construction Industry Scheme (“CIS”) applies. They thus extend not only to construction but to alteration or repair of buildings, some types of electrical and plumbing work, site clearance etc. More details can be found in our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vat-domestic-reverse-charge-for-construction-services-live-today/\"><strong>blog</strong></a>.</p>\n<h4>IR35 &#8211; Off Payroll Working</h4>\n<p>The IR35 rules continue as normal. The fundamental change here is where the potential liability for payroll taxes falls, should HMRC dispute your status. From 6 April 2021, it could be on your client and as a result many medium and large companies are blanket-banning contractors. If this change impacts on you and you are having to move to PAYE or an umbrella company, there will be fundamental changes to your existing company.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ir35-soft-landing/\"><strong>blog </strong></a>details this further. The only recent news is the ‘soft landing’ where companies will not have to pay penalties on any inaccuracies within the first 12 months of the new rules coming into effect, unless there is “clear evidence of deliberate non-compliance”.</p>\n<p>If this impacts you, you should stop your payroll from 31 March 2021. If we run your payroll for you, you MUST let us know that this has impacted on you, so we can cease it.</p>\n<p>HMRC CEST <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax\"><strong>tool </strong></a>may be useful if you are currently discussing this with your clients.</p>\n<p>Other tax planning opportunities are available on the closure of the company, especially as the rumoured changes to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Capital Gains Tax</a> did not materialise. Please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">contact us</a> if you would like to explore further.</p>\n<h3>Individuals</h3>\n<h4>Tax Bands*</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Your tax-free personal allowance has increased slightly to £12,570 (from £12,500)</li>\n<li>The point where high-rate tax comes in has increased slightly to £50,270 (from £50,000)</li>\n<li>Your national insurance now starts at £9,568.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Scotland varies here</p>\n<h4>Capital Gains Tax</h4>\n<p>Remember if you sell a residential property as an individual or partnership, you may <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">need to pay Capital Gains Tax</a> and from the 6 April 2020 this needs to be done within 30 days. Please see our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/recap-capital-gains-tax-changes/\"><strong>blog</strong></a>, as a reminder of this for you.</p>\n<h4>2020/21 Pension Payments</h4>\n<p>If you are considering making a further <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions/\">personal pension</a> payment, you may wish to do this before 5 April 2021 as it will extend your basic rate tax band and allow additional tax relief. There are various limits and rules surrounding pensions and if you are considering making a large contribution then you need to check you comply.</p>\n<p>If you run your own company, your company can make the contribution, which may allow you to make higher additional payments up to £40,000 per annum plus unused relief brought forward. If you are considering this you should contact your pension advisor and let us know the contribution in due course. Remember that the tax relief on pension contributions is given in the year that the contributions are actually paid.</p>\n<p>You can also reduce the tax you will pay by making donations to charities and investments to EIS, SEIS, VCTs etc. Please see our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2021/\"><strong>blog </strong></a>for more ideas of how to reduce your tax before the end of the tax year.</p>\n<h4>Allowances You Can Claim</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are a few of the allowances you can claim to help reduce your tax:</li>\n<li>The first £2,000 of dividends are tax-free;</li>\n<li>The first £1,000 of interest is tax-free (if you are a low-rate tax payer);</li>\n<li>The first £12,300 of capital gains you make are tax-free;</li>\n<li>You may be able to claim a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/property-and-trade-allowances/\">trading allowance</a> of £1,000 if you are self-employed;</li>\n<li>You may be able to claim a rental allowance of £1,000 if you rent property;</li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">income tax allowance</a> is £12,570;</li>\n<li>You can claim rent a room allowance of £7,500; and</li>\n<li>Marriage allowance, £1,260.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To name but a few&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Allowances You Can Lose?</h4>\n<p>On the flip side, if your income is more than £100,000, your Personal Allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 that your income exceeds this threshold. This means your allowance is zero if your income is £125,000 or above.</p>\n<p>High Income <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/child-benefit/\">Child Benefit tax charge</a> is worked out on the highest income of the two spouses. If one of them exceeds £50,000 per annum, this tax charge will be triggered and part or all of your claim will be payable when your individual income exceeds £60,000.</p>\n<h2>Fee Protection Policy</h2>\n<p>We will be in touch with you shortly with our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-fee-protection-insurance-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">new Fee Protection Policy</a> for the new Tax Year, so please keep an eye out for this, in case it is of interest to you and/or your business.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>At this most difficult of times, we are doing everything we can to help and support as many people as possible, for example by keeping them up to date with all the latest news and support schemes as we have done here.

Since 2010 HMRC have strengthened their approach to enquiry work by using wider powers and sophisticated software and consequently secured a record £34.1 billion of additional tax revenue in 2018/19, up a staggering £3.8 billion on the previous year. We expect the number of enquires to grow exponentially as the Government looks to recover the enormous £350bn government spend through the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as ensuring that the measures put in place to support the economy through this period have been utilised correctly by taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Are you protected against a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-hmrc-checks-and-enquiries-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">HMRC enquiry</a>?

HMRC opens investigations to see if the taxpayer has paid the right amount of tax on a random or selective basis.  All this helps the government fill its ever expanding public finance black hole.</p>\n<h2>Beware of “Connect”!</h2>\n<p>HMRC now uses a sophisticated database called ‘Connect’ to start more than 80% of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-enquiry-contact-page/\">tax enquiries</a>. The system collects data from 30 different sources, including UK and offshore banks, Companies House, the Land Registry, estate agents, the DVLA and other licensing authorities, and social media.</p>\n<p>The data can be instantaneously reviewed by more than 3,000 HMRC investigators to produce a financial fingerprint for any taxpayer. If there are any discrepancies between <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a> or business accounts sent to HMRC, a tax enquiry will follow as sure as night follows day. Tax enquiries started from ‘Connect’ have produced billions of pounds in additional tax over the last few years. Things like Making Tax Digital (&#8216;MTD&#8217;) only gives HMRC more information to help their investigations.</p>\n<p>Using ‘Connect’, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-protection-do-you-have-against-a-hmrc-enquiry/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"131\">HMRC can now target enquiries</a> more accurately than ever before – but they still get it wrong sometimes. That’s why we will always challenge HMRC regarding their reasons for an enquiry when defending clients.</p>\n<h2>What could an investigation involve?</h2>\n<p>HMRC so far has been targeting the SME sector, medical professionals such as dentists/doctors and ‘hidden wealth’ in particular, where HMRC call upon individuals who are apparently living beyond their declared means.  They often have specific campaigns aimed at such groups, but everyone is at risk of an enquiry.</p>\n<p>HMRC may have information about an offshore bank account, an expensive asset like a luxury car or even images from Google Earth showing a large extension. Reviewing records up to six years old is not uncommon and cost thousands to defend. If they can prove there is deliberate fraud, they can even go back 20 years. Imagine the time it would take and the anxiety this would cause you and everyone close to you.</p>\n<h2>Covid-19</h2>\n<p>As an additional benefit this protection provides complementary telephone access to employment, health &amp; safety and general legal advisors, including support for employers with any adjustments made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<h2>When HMRC comes knocking…</h2>\n<p>Case of mistaken identity &#8211; A husband &amp; wife partnership selling and installing double glazing was investigated by HMRC. At a meeting, HMRC alleged the husband had been dishonest. By the end of a long and detailed enquiry, HMRC repaid £129 of tax to the partnership and apologised, confirming that the allegation of dishonesty was a case of mistaken identity.</p>\n<p>Accountancy fees were approximately £5,000 and were paid in full by our Fee Protection Policy.</p>\n<h2>Where our service comes in</h2>\n<p>If the HMRC states its intention to investigate your tax payments don’t panic. Then call us – your dedicated accountant and best defence.</p>\n<p>We will translate the many complicated questions the taxman may pose, manage the entire conversation with the taxman, help you submit any required information and minimise the impact on your business or personal accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“HMRC is continually embarking on new ways to target you using a range of approaches and new technology.

      "content": "<p>The impact of coronavirus continues to be substantial, with many businesses across the UK facing significant business worries and little certainty on the edge of the horizon. In such a situation, employers therefore need to consider all eventualities, including potentially making people redundant, it is the only responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p>However, the problem with redundancy is that it is final and potentially deprives the employer of much-needed skills and talent that may be needed once the pandemic is over. It can also impact if and when you can recruit.</p>\n<p>Below we consider some of the other options available to employers, although it is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. The Government&#8217;s Job Retention (“Furlough”) Scheme</h2>\n<p>One of the key policies that the government announced back in March 2020 to support businesses and individuals against COVID-19 was the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (&#8216;CJRS&#8217; or &#8216;furlough&#8217; Scheme) to discourage employers making employees redundant. Here employees could access financial support to continue paying part of the salary of those employees who would otherwise have been laid off during the Covid-19 crisis. This works by placing staff on “furlough”, during which time that member of staff conducts no work for their employer, but still has a percentage of their pay on which to live. The Scheme has been used significantly since its inception and has recently been extended to run until September 2021 (originally October 2020).</p>\n<p>Rather than losing talent in your workforce, you can be given the breathing space with the government contributing to their costs, but you can still have them back at work when you come out of the current crisis</p>\n<h2>2. Lay-offs and short-time working</h2>\n<p>Where an employer cannot provide work to an employee, they may, as a temporary measure (where permitted by the contract of employment) lay off the employee or put them on a short-time working arrangement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lay-off &#8211; where an employer no longer requires an employee to attend work for a temporary period. The employee will not be paid but may be entitled to a statutory Guarantee Payment — presently the maximum is £30 a day for five days in any three-month period (maximum of £145 with part-time entitlement being pro-rata). The major problem with laying off staff is that the employer must have a contractual right to do it or they could face claims of constructive unfair dismissal and unauthorised deduction of wages at the employment tribunal. A further problem is that employees who are laid off will have a right to treat themselves as dismissed by reason of redundancy (and are entitled to the associated redundancy package) if a contractual lay-off extends beyond four consecutive weeks, or beyond six weeks in any 12-week period.</li>\n<li>Short-time working &#8211; similar to laying-off. The employer unilaterally reduces an employee&#8217;s hours and pay on a temporary basis. As with lay-offs, there must be a contractual right for the employer to make the change, and, again, the employee retains the right to claim a redundancy payment once certain timescales have been reached. The employee on short-time working may also be entitled to a statutory Guarantee Payment — mentioned above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are considering either of these options, you should first check whether you as an employer have the contractual right to do so, and none of the other options mentioned here (including Furlough) would be better for all concerned.</p>\n<h2>3. Reduction of hours and pay by agreement</h2>\n<p>You could introduce a shorter working week (and, therefore, a reduction in pay) as a temporary measure. This will require consultation with the workforce and their written consent to the temporary changes. You should make it clear during the consultation that the alternative will be redundancy. A temporary reduction in hours and pay is more likely to be accepted by your employees as an alternative to the finality of redundancy. You are likely to face claims at the employment tribunal if you introduce such a measure unilaterally. Reductions or stopping overtime can also work similarly here.</p>\n<h2>4. Change to recruitment policy</h2>\n<p>There are several actions that you could take, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>withdraw job offers and/or deferring new starters — but remember unilaterally withdrawing a job offer that has been accepted will be a breach of contract and that deferring a new recruit’s start date will require their consent if the offer has already been accepted; however, the sums involved in payment for breach are not likely to be substantial especially if you compare this to the redundancy of long serving members of staff;</li>\n<li>changing how you recruit, for example going direct rather than using recruiters;</li>\n<li>a recruitment freeze; and/or</li>\n<li>reduce or stop the use of temporary staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recruiting right now, just might not be right for those concerned. You can also reduce your wage costs by simply not recruiting when people leave the business, through natural attrition.</p>\n<h2>5. Redeployment</h2>\n<p>You could consider redeploying those employees who have seen a recent downturn of their work. They could be redeployed to areas of the business where there is a maintained or increased workload. However, remember, they may need a short period of retraining to support the redeployment. There could also be a possibility of staff being moved to another employer on a temporary basis. The new employer would meet the salary costs.</p>\n<h2>6. Sabbaticals and unpaid leave</h2>\n<p>Some employees may welcome the opportunity for unpaid time off. You could even pay a “sweetener” to encourage this option, if Furlough isn&#8217;t the answer for them.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Whilst redundancy is an option a responsible employer cannot ignore in a tough climate, there are also other options available, including furlough, lay-offs, short-time working arrangements, reductions in hours or pay, changing your recruitment strategy, redeployment, sabbaticals or other unpaid leave.

Likewise, many new business people we work with want to launch as a limited company straight away.</p>\n<p>There are a record number of self-employed people in Britain and that&#8217;s led to the formation of a record number of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited companies</a>. But what is a limited company and why, for many entrepreneurs, is this the business structure they want?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In this article, we consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What a limited company is;</li>\n<li>The advantages and disadvantages of running a registered limited company;</li>\n<li>What legal requirements are there when running a registered limited company?;</li>\n<li>How to set up and register your company;</li>\n<li>Frequently-asked questions about limited companies; and</li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White</a> checklist for registering a limited company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is a limited company?</h2>\n<p>A limited company is a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">type of business structure</a> which has a separate legal identity for its shareholders and directors. This makes it different to a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> business structure where the owner and the business have the same legal identity.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s the difference between a private limited company and a public limited company?</h3>\n<p>There are two types of limited company &#8211; &#8220;private&#8221; and &#8220;public&#8221;. Most limited companies are private limited companies which only require one shareholder and a minimal amount of share capital.</p>\n<p>With a public limited company, a minimum of £50,000 share capital is required, it must file its accounts six months after year end (as opposed to nine for a private limited company), it must hold annual general meetings, and, subject to the acquisition of a trading certificate, its shares may be publicly traded on the stock market.</p>\n<h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of running a limited company?</h2>\n<p>As a separate legal entity, a limited company can enter into agreements, take out finance, employ members of staff, purchase or hire assets and property and more.</p>\n<p>In theory, this means that, unlike with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> where s/he is personally responsible for all of the debts accrued and unpaid by a business, there is no personal liability on directors and shareholders when a limited company ceases trading or enters bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>In most cases though, smaller or newer limited company directors are required to sign directors&#8217; guarantees on the debt their business takes on. If the company fails, the likelihood is that the lender will pursue them in a personal capacity for outstanding debt.</p>\n<p>Some supplier or customers may also prefer you to be a limited company as they will perceive you to potentially be bigger than you actually are (reputational impact).</p>\n<p>Limited companies are generally far more tax efficient. The amount you and your company pays in corporation tax and personal tax is normally lower than the income tax and National Insurance <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> pay on their profit.</p>\n<h2>What legal requirements are there on limited companies and their directors?</h2>\n<p>All limited companies require at least one director to run the business. The directors of a company are legally required to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit their annual accounts online to Companies House;</li>\n<li>Submit an online <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax (CT600)</a> return to Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs (&#8216;HMRC&#8217;) within nine months of their year end;</li>\n<li>File a confirmation statement with Companies House once a year which includes a summary of shareholders and the share capital they hold, the company&#8217;s registered office address, and details of the directors;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Pay all employees (including directors) via a payroll system</a> making payments of income tax and NI Class 1 contributions including withholding employees&#8217; tax deductions until the 22nd of the following month before transferring them and NI Employers&#8217; Contributions payments to HMRC;</li>\n<li>Set up and run a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions/\">workplace pension system;</a></li>\n<li>Register for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">VAT and any other taxes</a> online for which the company has a liability; and</li>\n<li>Trade solvently &#8211; ensuring that your limited company is able to meet its financial liabilities. If you believe the limited company has insufficient cash to continue trading, you must act to maximise your creditors&#8217; interests at which point you should call in an insolvency practitioner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Seven steps to setting up and registering your company</h2>\n<p>To form a limited company, you need to take the following seven steps:</p>\n<h3>Step 1 &#8211; choose your directors and shareholders</h3>\n<p>First, you need to decide who&#8217;s going to own the company and who&#8217;s going to run it? In most cases, there will be significant or complete overlap between shareholders and directors.</p>\n<p>There must be at least one shareholder and at least one company director &#8211; they can be the same person. In many companies, there are multiple shareholders each holding a different size of ownership of the companies.</p>\n<h4>What is share capital?</h4>\n<p>Share capital is the money invested into a company by its shareholders in exchange for ownership of shares when setting up a limited company. Shareholdings may change later on with the introduction of further capital from existing or new shareholders or investors.</p>\n<h4>Who are the people with significant control over the business?</h4>\n<p>A person with significant control (&#8216;PSC&#8217;) of a limited company is someone who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>holds more than 25% of the voting rights and/or shares within a company and</li>\n<li>can appoint or remove members of the board.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to inform Companies House when setting up a limited company who the PSCs are and update it whenever this changes.</p>\n<h3>Step 2 &#8211; choose your company name</h3>\n<p>With over 1,500 companies registered in England every day, your first choice of company name might not be available so you should decide quickly in case someone else has the same idea. One thing you should make sure of is that, when you choose your business name, you make sure the online domain name is available for it before you begin trading.</p>\n<p>You can check whether your desired company name is available by <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company-name-availability\">clicking here</a> with this online form from Companies House &#8211; you&#8217;ll hear back straight away. You can also check whether the .co.uk domain name is available for your business by <a href=\"https://www.nominet.uk/whois/\">clicking here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 3 &#8211; choose a registered office</h3>\n<p>Next, you need to choose a registered office &#8211; this is the address to which all official documentation will be sent. It doesn&#8217;t need to be your trading address &#8211; it can be your Solicitor&#8217;s or Accountant&#8217;s address, for example, but you do need to make sure that whichever registered office address you choose which you don&#8217;t control forwards all postal mail onto you without delay.</p>\n<h3>Step 4 &#8211; create your formation documents for Companies House</h3>\n<p>When you form your company, you&#8217;ll need to provide Companies House with your Memorandum of Association and your Articles of Association. Template documents are available online but you may wish to consult with an Accountant or Solicitor to have bespoke documents drawn up for you depending on the complexity of your business structure and the number of shareholders.</p>\n<h3>Step 5 &#8211; register your limited company direct, through a company formation agent, or through your Accountant</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;re now ready to register your company. You&#8217;ll need to submit the trading activity of the company using the Companies House SIC code system. This may be difficult for newer internet-based companies because the SIC code system is only updated infrequently &#8211; <a href=\"http://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic/\">click here</a> to see the current list.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need to notify Companies House of the amount of share capital and how this is divided among the shareholders of the business, the names of directors and PSCs within the business, and the names of the business officers.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be sent a Certificate of Incorporation for your records within a week by Companies House (if you request this) which contains the company number and the date of formation,</p>\n<h3>Step 6 &#8211; set up a business bank account</h3>\n<p>You should set up a business bank account without delay &#8211; please never use a personal bank account instead of a business bank account.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s from your business bank account that direct debits to collect corporation tax, VAT, payroll taxes, and more will be set up. It is also much easier for your Accountant to keep your financial records up-to-date and accurate by having a clear demarcation between personal and business spending.</p>\n<p>During the coronavirus, this is probably the most difficult of the seven steps.</p>\n<h3>Step 7 &#8211; notify HMRC</h3>\n<p>Within three months, you need to register your Limited Company with HM Revenue and Customs. HMRC will need you to register for Corporation Tax and to acquire a 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (&#8216;UTR&#8217;) for the business. This will be sent to the registered office of the company. and is needed to liaise with HMRC and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">submit the corporation tax return</a> to them.

If you decide that you want to form a limited company as its only shareholder and directors, you can do so.</p>\n<h3>How much does it cost to set up a limited company?</h3>\n<p>You can set up a limited company for £12 direct with Companies House &#8211; formation normally takes place with 24 hours of payment by credit or debit card. When registering, you must provide the details of three pieces of information about yourself and all other guarantors or shareholders within the business including passport number code, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> number, telephone number (including area code), father&#8217;s first name, mother&#8217;s maiden name, and the town or city of your birth. If you form it through a formation agent or an Accountant or Solicitor, typically it will cost more, but it will be easier to do so.</p>\n<h3>How much do company formation services cost?</h3>\n<p>Your Accountant or Solicitor can register your limited company with Companies House &#8211; you could alternatively choose a formation agent to do it for you. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">These services</a> will cost extra however third parties normally bundle in additional services as part of value-added packages. These packages will often include the opening a business bank account, registered office address service, filing of your first annual statement, VAT and tax registration, and they may register a domain containing your company name.</p>\n<h3>What are Articles of Association?</h3>\n<p>Articles of Association are a contract between a company and its shareholders which govern, among other things, how shareholder decisions must be made, board meetings and the procedures used during them, the circumstances under which forced share sales can be allowed, how new shares must be issued, and how company directors are appointed.</p>\n<p>Articles can be changed or updated following a general meeting at which 75% or more the voting shares back the proposed alterations.</p>\n<h3>What is a Memorandum of Association?</h3>\n<p>A Memorandum of Association is a legal document created when a company is formed and registered to codify its relationship with its shareholders and to set out the main business of the company (the activities in which the company is permitted to participate).</p>\n<h3>What is the difference between directors and shareholders?</h3>\n<p>Shareholders&#8217; behaviour is governed by the Articles of Associations whereas directors&#8217; behaviour is covered by their own directors&#8217; duties and service agreements.</p>\n<h3>Which is the better structure for me &#8211; a limited company or sole trader?</h3>\n<p>For micro-businesses, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> is normally the better choice. Setting up as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> is easy and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> and their Accountants have far less paperwork to do than limited companies.</p>\n<p>However, past a certain point, it&#8217;s far more tax efficient to be a limited company. How is it much more tax efficient? Here&#8217;s an example &#8211; a company director can pay him or herself with a mixture of salary and dividends &#8211; a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> will pay 20% income tax and 9% NI on income between £12,500 and £50,000 whereas a director may only pay 7.5% on income between £14,500 and £50,000.</p>\n<p>The gap is narrowing though and the government has stated its intention to narrow the gap further through changing the tax code and increasing corporation tax.</p>\n<p>However, tax is not the only factor to consider when you decide your business structure. Limited companies are also very good as they provide protection on your personal assets (limitation of liability) and can make your business appear bigger than you actually are to help you secure bigger contracts as a result (reputation impact).</p>\n<h3>What does a company secretary do?</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-services/the-best-companies-secretarial-and-company-formation-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">company secretary</a> is the official within a company responsible for ensuring that the company complies with the Companies Act (2006).</p>\n<h3>What is a service address?</h3>\n<p>A service address is a postal address for a director, shareholder, guarantor, secretary, or a PSC within your limited company to which official correspondence can be sent from the government, the courts, HMRC, or Companies House. Many directors still list their residential address when setting up a limited company although many more, for reasons of privacy, will use a &#8220;care of&#8221; arrangement using their Accountants&#8217; or Solicitor&#8217;s addresses.</p>\n<h2>Setting up a limited company &#8211; your Black and White checklist</h2>\n<p>Let Black and White Accounting help you (and your fellow shareholders and directors) in setting up a limited company, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">please contact us</a>.

      "content": "<p>With April swiftly approaching, there are many key changes in Employment Law. We highlight the five key ones below with employment tribunal, statutory sick pay, family leave, minimum wages and perhaps for us, most significantly IR35 changes.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Employment Tribunal Compensation Awards and Rates</h2>\n<p>It has been confirmed that employment tribunal compensation rates are to increase from 6 April 2021. As of this date, the maximum week’s pay for redundancy pay purposes will increase from £538 to £544; however, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-pay/\">statutory guarantee pay</a> will be staying at £30.</p>\n<p>This is important for the purposes of tribunal claims because it means that the maximum statutory redundancy pay, as well as unfair dismissal basic award pay, will both now be £16,320. The unfair dismissal compensatory award, which is set to compensate the claimant for past and future lost attributed to the dismissal, is a maximum of 52 weeks’ pay, subject to a new maximum of £89,493.</p>\n<p>The maximum amount of additional award for unfair dismissal, set to compensate claimants when employers fail to adhere to a tribunal instruction to re-engage them, taking into account average weekly earnings, will rise to £28,288.</p>\n<h2>2. Statutory Sick Pack (&#8216;SSP&#8217;)</h2>\n<p>SSP refers to the amount that employers must pay eligible employees if they are too ill to work. At present, it is paid for up to 28 weeks. SSP is currently available to people who are self-isolating, either because they or someone in their household has COVID-19. Outside of this, SSP is available for employees from the fourth day they are sick.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for SSP, an employee must earn an average of £120 a week minimum and have been ill, self-isolating or shielding for at least four days in a row (including non-working days).</p>\n<p>The current rate is £95.85 per week since 6 April 2020 and is set to rise to £96.35 from 6 April 2021. The lower earnings limit in relation to eligibility to statutory payments is to stay the same at £120 per week.</p>\n<h2>3. Family Leave</h2>\n<p>The weekly rates of statutory family leave &#8211; e.g. maternity/paternity leave, etc.  will increase by 77p per week on 4 April 2021, from £151.20 per week to £151.97 per week.</p>\n<h2>4. Minimum Wage Rates</h2>\n<p>As Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget, from 1 April 2021, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/minimum-wage/\">national minimum wage rates</a> are also set to increase. The new hourly rates are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workers aged 23 and over (National Living Wage, &#8216;NLW&#8217;) – £8.91;</li>\n<li>Workers aged 21-22 – £8.36;</li>\n<li>Development rates for workers aged 18–20 – £6.56;</li>\n<li>Young workers rate for workers aged 16–17 – £4.62; and</li>\n<li>Apprentices under 19, or over 19 and in first year of the apprenticeship – £4.30.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As seen above, the NLW threshold is lowering to include all those aged 23 and over. Currently, the NLW is payable only to people who were aged 25 and over.</p>\n<h2>5. IR35</h2>\n<p>The IR35 legislation, which aims to ensure that contractors are paying the appropriate amount of tax, is also changing for some private sector businesses.</p>\n<p>Currently, most contractors are required to determine their own status as employee or contractor; however, from 6 April 2021, this liability will pass to medium and large-sector clients.

There are many different types of business structures available for entrepreneurs to choose from in the UK and is being a sole trader the right business structure for your business?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What a sole trader is;</li>\n<li>Self employed <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> versus limited company &#8211; the difference between and the advantages and disadvantages of each legal structure;</li>\n<li>What you should do before you register as a sole trader;</li>\n<li>How to register as a sole trader; and</li>\n<li>Which taxes sole traders and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-are-the-advantages-of-being-self-employed-and-how-to-enjoy-them/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"73\">self employed</a> people need to pay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sole traders &#8211; at a glance</h2>\n<p>What is the definition of a sole trader? A sole trader is the outright owner of a business which is not registered as a separate legal entity with Companies House.</p>\n<p>All profits made by a sole trader belong to them and tax must be paid on those profits in the form of Income Tax, National Insurance, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Capital Gains Tax</a>, and more. We&#8217;ll cover these taxes later on.</p>\n<h2>Sole trader vs limited company &#8211; the advantages and disadvantages</h2>\n<p>When you ask an accountant the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-setup-a-limited-company/\">&#8220;sole trader vs limited company?&#8221;</a> question, the answer they give will depend on a lot of factors.</p>\n<h3>Who pays more tax?</h3>\n<p>Directors and shareholders of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited companies</a> are also responsible for paying Income Tax and National Insurance but the way they pay themselves is generally a lot different. They also remunerate themselves in dividends &#8211; dividends are distributions of post-tax profit made by a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>. The tax paid on dividends is a lot lower than the Income Tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance paid</a> by a sole trader.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Unlimited liability&#8221;</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> is a separate legal entity which can enter contracts, take out loans, employ people, and so on. If a limited company goes under, a director is not personally liable for any debt the company has incurred as a business owner.</p>\n<p>However, a self-employed person like a sole trader also have unlimited liability for the debts they incur as a business owner. This means that, should your sole trader business go under, the companies your business owes money to will chase you for the debt and some may seek to seize your personal assets. When they take ownership of your personal assets and resources, they will then choose to sell them to recoup the losses they have made on your loan.</p>\n<p>In theory however, this difference between running a sole trader business and a limited company is not as set as it appears. When a bank or a finance company lends a small or new-start limited company money, they will require the directors to take out personal guarantees which mean that, should the new business fail, the lenders will pursue the directors for their personal assets and resources too. This is, in essence, another form of unlimited liability which is not protected by a limited company&#8217;s legal status.</p>\n<h3>Easier paperwork?</h3>\n<p>With a sole trader <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">business structure</a>, you have one set of books you need to keep and, from those books, you can work out how much you need to pay in tax.</p>\n<p>With limited companies, you need to keep separate personal and business records. There&#8217;s a lot less paperwork involved in being self employed and running a sole trader business and, if you&#8217;re a contractor, you don&#8217;t have to worry about IR35 either.</p>\n<p>You also have to make payment to a solicitor or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/advisory-services/the-best-companies-secretarial-and-company-formation-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">company formation agent</a> to incorporate your limited company.</p>\n<h3>Can everyone see my annual accounts?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">Limited companies</a> are required by law to submit their accounts every tax year to Companies House. Anyone with access to the internet can search Companies&#8217; House website to access your accounts. Credit reference agencies also use this when determining your company&#8217;s credit score (different to your own individual credit score).</p>\n<p>There is no requirement to publish <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">accounts as a sole trader</a> business so no-one other than you, your accountant, and HMRC will know how well your business performed in the previous tax year and earlier tax years. However, your ability to access finance to grow your business as a sole trader will be dependent on your own individual credit score.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>With a limited company, you have to complete confirmation statements each year (at a cost of £13 if you do yourself) confirming your business&#8217; registered office, directors, and shareholders. People can see who you&#8217;re in business with and who has significant control over the decisions your limited company makes.</p>\n<p>Each director and shareholder must provide a correspondence address as part of the confirmation statement. Many directors and shareholders still use their home addresses as the given correspondence address although more are now giving the addresses of their accountants and solicitors.</p>\n<h2>Before registering as a sole trader</h2>\n<p>Of all types of business, sole traders can launch in the quickest time with these three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1 &#8211; create a business plan</strong>: you&#8217;re leaving behind the world of employment to become a sole trader. How much cash do you need to start your sole trader business? What level of profit do you need to make a comfortable and secure living? Where will you source your goods from and how will you take them to market? It&#8217;s best to get input and advice from an accountant before you launch so that you know whether self employment is a viable option for you;</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2 &#8211; choose a business name</strong>: you could choose to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-a-trading-name-everything-you-need-to-know/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"83\">trade with your own name</a> &#8211; many self employed people do &#8211; or do you want something more distinctive, catchy, and original?; and</li>\n<li>S<strong>tep 3 &#8211; take out business insurance</strong>: if you employ other people, operate from business premises, and/or work away from your office, you&#8217;ll need business insurance. You may also wish to take out keyperson insurance if you&#8217;re unable to work for an extended time through sickness or because of an accident.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also choose which accounting software package you want to use too. There are many advantages for sole traders by using accounting software &#8211; the biggest two are that you know how well your business is performing in a real-time basis and your accountant can use the information you enter into it to reduce the amount you&#8217;ll be charged in taxes.</p>\n<h2>Registering as a sole trader</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re ready to register as a sole trader, this is how you do it. You register using this <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment/self-employed\">online form</a> at HM Revenue and Customs&#8217; (HMRC) website for Self Assessment.</p>\n<p>You pay tax dependent on the financial information contained on your Self Assessment form. The tax you pay to HMRC is dependent on the level of profit you make during the year &#8211; we&#8217;ll share with you what taxes you have to pay when you run a sole trader company below.</p>\n<p>Remember that you have to register for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">HMRC&#8217;s Construction Industry scheme</a> if your business is involved in alterations, building repairs, building work, cleaning the inside of a building after construction work, decorations, demolition, dismantling, heating, lighting, power, water, and ventilation system installation, laying foundations, providing access works, or site preparation. Here&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme\">link</a> for that.</p>\n<p>Within 10 days, you&#8217;ll get an activation code from HMRC allowing you access to your &#8220;Government Gateway&#8221; account as well as your Unique Taxpayer Reference number &#8211; you or your tax agent need to quote your Unique Taxpayer Reference number if you&#8217;re contacting HMRC .</p>\n<h2>Which taxes are sole traders responsible for paying?</h2>\n<p>Sole traders are responsible for paying some or all of the following taxes depending on their level of profitability and whether they employ staff or not.</p>\n<h3>Tax</h3>\n<p>You pay 20%-45% of your profits to HMRC in tax depending on how much money you make in a given tax year. Your first £12,500 of earnings each year is tax free.</p>\n<h3>Class 2 National Insurance (NI)</h3>\n<p>Class 2 NI costs £3.05 a week but you&#8217;re only responsible for paying it if your business makes £6,475 profit or more.</p>\n<h3>Class 4 NI</h3>\n<p>The main difference with Class 4 NI is that it is based upon a percentage of your business profits. Sole traders making £9,501 in profit or more during the tax year are charged 9% of that profit in Class 4 NI. The charge is 2% of any profit sole traders make above £50,000.</p>\n<h3>Employment taxes</h3>\n<p>You will have quite a number of extra responsibilities as a sole trader if your business employs other people. There&#8217;ll be extra taxes you need to pay and the combination of having to run a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">payroll and workplace pension</a> scheme will mean lots of additional paperwork.</p>\n<p>You will almost certainly need business accounting software to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/software-spotlight-payroll-services-at-black-white-accounting/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"90\">run payroll</a> or use an accountant or a bookkeeper for this.</p>\n<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>\n<p>You are required by HMRC to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">pay Capital Gains Tax</a> (CGT) on profits made following the disposal or sales of most assets (excluding your primary residential property) within a tax year. At time of writing, the CGT annual allowance is £12,300 in profits under which no CGT is payable.</p>\n<h3>Do I need to register for VAT?</h3>\n<p>You must register for VAT if your turnover is greater than £85,000 during the course of a tax year or whose turnover could exceed £85,000 within the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>There are additional responsibilities for sole traders whose businesses are registered for VAT.</p>\n<h2>What is a Self Assessment tax return?</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self Assessment tax return</a> is the online/paper form a self employed person is required to fill out every year which informs HMRC of the income/profit you made during a tax year.</p>\n<p>You must complete and submit your Self Assessment by 31st January every year &#8211; it contains financial information from the previous 6 April to 5 April period. For example, sole traders&#8217; next Self Assessment must be completed and submitted by 31 January 2022 and this covers the financial period of 6 April 2020 to 5 April 2021.</p>\n<p>On or by 31 January each year, in addition to completing the form, you must make payment in full for the tax you owe plus an advanced payment towards your next Self Assessment bill. On the 31 July each year, you make a second advanced payment towards your next Self Assessment bill. <span style=\"font-size: revert; background-color: var(--wp--custom--body--background-color); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--semplicita-pro);\">To ensure compliance with HMRC regulations, it&#8217;s crucial for self-employed individuals to complete and submit their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self Assessment tax returns</a> on time. Seeking guidance from a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">knowledgeable self-assessment accountant</a> can streamline this process, providing valuable insights into managing your financial obligations effectively.</span></p>\n<h2>Can HMRC check my financial records?</h2>\n<p>You are personally required by law to keep records of your trading activities. You must keep your records for at least 5 years after the 31 January submission deadline of the relevant tax year. HMRC could check your payroll records for up to 3 years and they could check VAT records for up to 10 years. However, if HMRC can prove deliberate fraud, this can increase to 20 years.</p>\n<h2>Black And White Accounting</h2>\n<p>Do you have a business idea, or are you already setup and looking for some support?

For example, for the ATED year 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, your ATED return must be submitted and the tax paid on or by 30 April 2022.</p>\n<p>The ATED charge is as follows on UK residential properties valued at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£500,000 up to £1 million band &#8211; £3,700;</li>\n<li>£1 million up to £2 million &#8211; £7,500;</li>\n<li>£2 million up to £5 million &#8211; £25,300;</li>\n<li>£5 million up to £10 million &#8211; £59,100;</li>\n<li>£10 million up to £20 million &#8211; £118,600; and</li>\n<li>£20 million or more &#8211; £237,400.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The charges shown above are for the year 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.</p>\n<p>If part of the property you own is used as a residence and other parts for other purposes, the ATED tax payable will only be judged on the value of the parts of the property used for residential purposes.</p>\n<h3>Who needs to complete an ATED return?</h3>\n<p>You need to complete an ATED return if your property is a dwelling based in the UK and the property is owned by a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>collective investment scheme;</li>\n<li>company;</li>\n<li>open ended investment vehicle;</li>\n<li>partnership containing one or more partners which is a company; and</li>\n<li>unit trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For tax years starting 1 April 2016, 1 April 2017, 1 April 2018, 1 April 2019, 1 April 2020, and 1 April 2021, ATED returns had/have to be completed and submitted for any property whose value is £500,000 or greater.</p>\n<p>For the tax year beginning 1 April 2015, a return had to be completed and submitted for any property owned whose value is £1 million or greater. For the tax years beginning April 2013 and April 2014, a return had to be completed and submitted for any property owned whose value is £2 million or greater.</p>\n<h2>ATED and property value</h2>\n<p>To work out how much you&#8217;ll have to pay in ATED, you&#8217;ll also have to work out what your relevant and qualifying properties are valued at.</p>\n<p>Under current HMRC rules, you&#8217;re allowed to decide the value of the property yourself or bring in a professional to value it for you. The price your property is valued at is on an &#8220;open-market willing buyer, willing seller basis&#8221;. If your company doesn&#8217;t have an unencumbered freehold interest in the property, the value you attach to the property does not have to be the &#8220;vacant possession valuation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You are required to revalue the property every five years. The first two revaluation dates under the scheme were the 1 April 2012 and 1 April 2017. The next valuation date is due on 1 April 2022.</p>\n<p>Even if you buy a property a few weeks or months before one of these dates, you must follow the five-yearly revaluation schedule set out by HMRC.</p>\n<h3>The date of the substantial acquisition of a dwelling</h3>\n<p>Your ATED return will be due 30 days<strong> </strong>after your company or commercial vehicle has purchased the dwelling.</p>\n<h3>Newly-constructed dwellings or property adapted to contain new dwellings</h3>\n<p>You have to complete an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">ATED form</a> for any newly-built dwellings or any new dwellings which come into existence through conversion within 90 days of the date on which your local authority included it on its council tax roll.</p>\n<h3>The date of the substantial disposal of a part of its ownership of a dwelling</h3>\n<p>If a company sells part of a property for more than £40,000, this is likely to require you to carry out a new valuation which you must then report to HMRC.</p>\n<h2>ATED interest and penalties</h2>\n<p>If your ATED form is not submitted and the tax not paid to HMRC on time (within 30 days of the end of March), penalties will apply. This also applies to the requirement to complete an ATED form within 30 days of purchase of a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/land-and-buildings-transaction-tax/\">new property or within 90 days of a new build property</a>.</p>\n<p>Interest may also be charged on both if they&#8217;ve not been paid on or by the due date and on penalties as a result of late payments.</p>\n<h2>ATED relief</h2>\n<p>You may claim relief for the property you own if one or more of the following circumstances apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you own a farmhouse occupied by a farm worker or a former long-serving farm worker;</li>\n<li>this is a development intended for resale and you are a property developer;</li>\n<li>the property is a financial institution repossession where it has lent the money (with or without interest) to a borrower to purchase the property;</li>\n<li>your property is open to the public for at least 28 days of the year or more;</li>\n<li>the property is owned by a qualifying housing co-operative or a registered provider of social housing;</li>\n<li>the property is part of property trader business stock where the intent is eventual resale of the property;</li>\n<li>the property is for provision of living accommodation to certain qualifying employees by a trading business;</li>\n<li>the property qualified as a regulated home reversion plan acquisition; and/or</li>\n<li>you have let the property to a third party on a commercial basis and it is not occupied (or available for occupation) by any person or company connected with the owner at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further guidance is available <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-tax-on-enveloped-dwellings-technical-guidance\">here</a> on the HMRC website (sections 30 to 41).

      "content": "<p>Welcome to the next stage of your career – welcome to the world of the self-employed. One of the first things anyone becoming self-employed on their own has to do is to tell HM Revenue and Customs and, in this article, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about how to register as a sole trader.</p>\n<p>First, let’s cover a few basics.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Sole trader – the definition</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> is a self-employed person with complete ownership of the business they set up and run. If you want to share ownership with another person or people, then you would need to set up something called an “unincorporated partnership”. We cover setup and what it is below.</p>\n<p>In the eyes of the law, there is no difference between you and your business. You can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">borrow money to run and grow your business</a> but you are personally responsible for those debts. In other words, you would be liable to repay any unpaid debts you ran up in the course of your business in the event of failure.</p>\n<h2>Sole trader versus limited company</h2>\n<p>If you set up a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a>, then that limited company is a separate legal entity to you. That’s important because you are not personally responsible for any debts your limited company incurs unlike as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the truth is a little bit more complex than that. While any debts you run up may belong to the company, most lenders will require the shareholders and owners of new and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">small limited companies</a> to personally guarantee the debt – commonly referred to as a “director’s guarantee”.</p>\n<p>Owning and running a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-setup-a-limited-company/\">limited company</a> requires your accountant to do more work – being a sole trader is cheaper and simpler from a bookkeeping point of view.</p>\n<p><em>Black and White note</em> – you should use an online bookkeeping package like Xero for your financial recordkeeping. It makes it easier for your accountant to claim all allowable expenses possible to reduce your tax liability. In addition, all <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> should set up a separate business bank account and make sure that you’re strict in using your personal account for personal transactions and your business account for business transactions.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a business name</h2>\n<p>Before you register as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> and start trading, the first step you need to take is to consider which trading name you want to use.</p>\n<p>You can register your business name under your personal name but many sole traders prefer to trade with a brand new name.</p>\n<p>There are limitations on the names you can choose however.</p>\n<p>You can’t use <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-liability-partnership-services/\">“plc”, “public limited company”, “LLP”, “limited liability partnership”</a>, “Ltd”, or “limited”. There are also certain sensitive words you’re not allowed to use – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incorporation-and-names\">click here for a run-down</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also not choose a name which is the same or too similar to an existing trademark.</p>\n<p>Unlike with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited companies</a>, you do not have to register the name with Companies House.</p>\n<h2>Register for Self Assessment</h2>\n<p>When registering as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a>, you also register to receive the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self Assessment tax return</a> form. You can register using this <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment/self-employed\">online form</a> at HM Revenue and Customs&#8217; website.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">print off the form</a> on the website, fill it in, and send it to the address shown on the form. Alternatively, you can call HMRC direct on 0300 200 3310 for more information.</p>\n<p>Navigating the registration process as a sole trader and the subsequent self-assessment <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns can be simplified</a> with the assistance of a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">knowledgeable self-assessment accountant</a>. If you have questions or need guidance, consider reaching out for professional support.</p>\n<h3>What does it cost to register?</h3>\n<p>There is no cost to registering as a sole trader – it is completely free of charge.</p>\n<h3>Registering as a sole trader in building and construction</h3>\n<p>If your business is in the building and construction industry and you intend to be involved in any of the following activities, you must also register for the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cis-tax-deduction-calculator/\">HMRC Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</a>.</p>\n<p>Those activities are alterations, building repairs, building work, cleaning the inside of a building after <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">construction work</a>, decorations, demolition, dismantling, heating, lighting, power, water, and ventilation system installation, laying foundations, providing access works, or site preparation.</p>\n<p>You must either register as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A contractor (where you sub-contract others to do some or all of the building and construction work);</li>\n<li>A sub-contractor (where you are awarded contracts to carry out building and construction work from a contractor); or</li>\n<li>Both (if applicable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To register for the HMRC CIS, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme\">click here</a>.</p>\n<h2>What information do you need to register</h2>\n<p>When you register as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> at HMRC, you’ll need to following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of birth;</li>\n<li>Email address;</li>\n<li>Name;</li>\n<li>Name of business;</li>\n<li>National Insurance number (can’t find your NI number – fill in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-get-your-national-insurance-number-in-writing-ca5403\">form CA5403</a> to find out or call 0300 200 3502 or 0300 200 3519 for text phone users);</li>\n<li>Postal address;</li>\n<li>Start date;</li>\n<li>Telephone number; and</li>\n<li>What type of work you do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Register as a sole trader – the when</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">Sole traders</a> must register for Self Assessment as soon as they become self-employed. However, at the very latest, you need to register by the 5 October in your second year as a trader.</p>\n<p>For example, if you started trading on 15 April 2021 (tax year 2021-2022), you must register for Self Assessment by 5 October 2022 (tax year 2022-2023). If you register later than this date, you may receive a penalty from HMRC however if you complete and get <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your Self Assessment tax return</a> in by 31 January 2023 for the tax year 2021-2022 and you pay your tax and National Insurance in full, you will avoid HMRC&#8217;s penalty.</p>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>As soon as you have registered as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> and for Self Assessment, you&#8217;ll hear back from HMRC within 10 days (or up to three weeks if you&#8217;re abroad). They&#8217;ll send you a letter containing an activation code. You&#8217;ll need that activation code to log into your &#8220;Government Gateway&#8221; account.</p>\n<p>HMRC will send you your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) number. You&#8217;ll need your Unique Taxpayer Reference number to create your online Self Assessment account as a sole trader with HMRC. You only need to register for Self Assessment once &#8211; if you start working as a sole trader and then return to employment and then you wish to start working as a sole trader again, you simply use the same reference UTR number as before. If you&#8217;ve lost your reference UTR number, call 0300 200 3310 for HMRC&#8217;s Self Assessment helpline.</p>\n<p>When you log in to your online Self Assessment portal, you&#8217;ll also be able to see information on your current tax status, what your tax code is, how much tax you&#8217;ve paid previously, and the dates of your forthcoming tax returns.</p>\n<p>As a sole trader, you need to keep accurate and up-to-date records of the money your business earns and the money your business spends. You need to keep your records for up to 5 years in case HMRC wants to check them. The financial information you maintain and update for your business as a sole trader must conform to HMRC&#8217;s quality thresholds otherwise you will pay a penalty.</p>\n<h2>How am I taxed as a sole trader?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re leaving the world of employment to become a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> (with no PAYE income coming into your household from anywhere else), you&#8217;ll need to report the following on your tax returns:</p>\n<h3>Profits/income</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to pay <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">Income Tax on the profits you make</a>. Your profits are defined as the amount of money left over once all allowable expenses have been deducted from the revenue generated by the sales you&#8217;ve made.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t pay Income Tax on the first £12,500 of profit you make &#8211; this is your personal allowance. You do pay income tax on profits you make above that figure &#8211; 20% on the first £37,500 of taxable profit, 40% on the next £100,000, and 45% on any profit above that.</p>\n<p>Please note that your Personal Allowance reduces by £1 for every £2 you earn above £100,000.</p>\n<h3>Class 2 NI</h3>\n<p>If you make £6,475 profit or more during the tax year, you pay Class 2 NI at £3.05 a week.</p>\n<h3>Class 4 NI</h3>\n<p>If you make £9,501 profit or more during the tax year, you pay Class 4 NI at 9% on profits between £9,501 and £50,000 and 2% on profits about £50,000.</p>\n<p><em>Black and White note &#8211; please note that Scotland has its own Income Tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance system</a></em></p>\n<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>\n<p>You pay tax on any profit you make when you sell business assets including land, building, fixtures, fitting, plant, machinery, and so on. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Capital Gains Tax</a> is only payable when you make £12,300 in profit or more during the year.</p>\n<h3>Do I need to register for VAT as a sole trader?</h3>\n<p>You need to complete a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">Value Added Tax (VAT)</a> registration form if your turnover is greater than £85,000 or the point at which you expect your turnover to be £85,000 or more.</p>\n<p>You charge VAT on the invoices and sales you make to your customers &#8211; this is your &#8220;output VAT&#8221;. You also pay it on invoices your suppliers send you (if they&#8217;re VAT registered) &#8211; this is your &#8220;input VAT&#8221;.</p>\n<p>For most sole traders and businesses registered for VAT, you pay VAT once a quarter. To <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculate what you need to pay</a>, you subtract the input VAT you&#8217;ve incurred from the output VAT over the 3 month period.</p>\n<p>VAT is paid via the Making Tax Digital system.</p>\n<h2>How do I report and pay tax?</h2>\n<p>The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April.</p>\n<p>Sole traders and other business owners need to complete and return their Self Assessment forms by the 31 January following the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"172\">end of the previous tax</a> year. You must also pay in full whatever tax you owe by 31 January.</p>\n<h3>What is payment on account?</h3>\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole traders</a> pay tax on two dates in the year &#8211; <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-payment-on-account/\">31 January and 31 July</a>. On 31 January, you pay tax on what you accrued in the previous year as well as your first balancing payment.</p>\n<h3>What happens if I can&#8217;t pay my tax?</h3>\n<p>As long as you inform HRMC that you can&#8217;t pay the full amount of tax before 31 January and you have exhausted every other option of finding the money, HMRC may offer you a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc/overview\">time to pay</a>&#8221; arrangement.</p>\n<h3>Can I pay tax monthly?</h3>\n<p>You can pay your tax in monthly instalments if you owe £30,000 or less in tax, your tax returns are up to date, and you have no &#8220;time to pay&#8221; arrangements in effect with HMRC.</p>\n<h2>Coronavirus (COVID 19) information</h2>\n<p>As part of its response to the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, the government allowed sole traders and other owners of small businesses to defer their July 2020 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-payment-on-account/\">Payment on Account</a> until 31 January 2021.</p>\n<p><em>Black and White note </em>&#8211; you may also reduce your tax year 20-21 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-payment-on-account/\">payment on account</a> to preserve cash if your trading profits and cash flow have been affected by COVID 19. Please get in touch to ask us for more information.</p>\n<h2>Should I use an accountant?</h2>\n<p>Want to trade for yourself but not sure whether your new business needs an accountant?

They&#8217;re going to be doing this in two different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they&#8217;ll be raising <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a> to 25% over the course of this Parliament and</li>\n<li>they&#8217;re going to be aggressively pursuing individuals and companies whose use of Coronavirus-related schemes could be considered fraudulent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, scammers are still out there looking to exploit vulnerable individuals&#8217; and company owners&#8217; fears for their own benefit.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll look at the best ways to protect yourself against these frauds and what to do if you become a victim of one.</p>\n<h2>Coronavirus (COVID 19) Company Scams</h2>\n<h3>Job Retention Scheme (Furlough)</h3>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-february-2021/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-february-2021\">the government</a> reported that the number of employees working for business claiming furlough support was expected to reach 4.7m at the end of January 2021.</p>\n<p>For a staff member to receive payment of 80% of their wages (not including tax and NI payments), they can do no work for your business which is productive. Employers are forbidden from asking staff members to work but staff can participate in training or volunteering.</p>\n<p>You are also not allowed to ask staff to take a 20% reduction in their pay nor ask them to work as volunteers for your company.</p>\n<h3>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme</h3>\n<p>Under the third wave of the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), the self-employed are entitled to receive a grant of up to 80% of three months&#8217; average profits subject to a maximum of £7,500. Rules varied with the first and second grants and the details of the fourth grant are yet to be published.</p>\n<p>In October 2020, HMRC wrote to 24,000 people who they believe were falsely claiming the support. It is likely that the number of people under investigation suspected of making fraudulent claims will increase substantially in the coming years.</p>\n<h3>Statutory Sick Pay Support Scheme for Employers</h3>\n<p>Staff who are sick or who have been forced to isolate themselves can now obtain an online isolation note as evidence that they are unable to attend work. The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-pay/\">Statutory Sick Pay scheme</a> has been subject to many revisions during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to retain records for three years and, if you have made a wrongful claim, the penalty is £3,000.</p>\n<h3>Eat Out To Help Out Scheme</h3>\n<p>In August 2020, the Eat Out To Help Out Scheme was launched. 84,000 restaurants took up the offer which allowed them to subsidise the meals they offered to their customers on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.</p>\n<p>HMRC have since sent letters to 4,000 restaurants announcing their intention to begin compliance checks. You need to make sure that your records are up to date and that the claims you made pertained to actual takings during the scheme and not on the information HMRC holds about your historic trading patterns.</p>\n<h3>Reporting Coronavirus Relief Scheme Fraud to HMRC</h3>\n<p>If your business did not follow one or more of these rules above, HMRC may consider this behaviour as fraudulent. If you are concerned about that and want to speak with us in confidence, please call us on 0800 140 464.</p>\n<p>On 13 October 2020, a press release appeared on gov.uk announcing the launch of a new national hotline to report Coronavirus (COVID 19)-related fraud in association with Crimestoppers.</p>\n<p>Citizens are asked to get in touch with the fraud reporting hotline by calling 0800 587 5030. All calls are confidential. They are seeking information on cold calling schemes being pushed by criminals offering money from the government related to the Coronavirus (COVID 19) as well as details of any unusual patterns or instances of expenditure you&#8217;ve noticed during the pandemic by companies and individuals.</p>\n<h2>Protecting Yourself From Scammers</h2>\n<p>The crisis presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for scammers to target people whose lives had undergone severe disruption which many psychologist believed made individuals more vulnerable and suggestible. In fact to date, according to Citizens Advice, <strong>one in three Britons were targeted by a scammer during lockdown.</strong></p>\n<p>How should business owners and individuals protect themselves?</p>\n<h3>Take the scam test</h3>\n<p>Scammers are inventive and resourceful. They are always finding new ways to approach and dupe victims out of their personal details and bank details whether over the phone, face-to-face at your door, via social media, by text message, or sent online via email.</p>\n<p>They will often present themselves as figures of authority either working for your local council, working in the security department of your bank, officers at the &#8220;refunds team&#8221; or the &#8220;investigations team&#8221; within HMRC, and so on.</p>\n<p>To check whether the advice you&#8217;re being offered or the actions you&#8217;re being asked to take will put you at personal or financial risk, take the &#8220;scam&#8221; test to root out fraudsters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;<strong>S</strong>&#8220;- it seems too good to be true</li>\n<li>&#8220;<strong>C</strong>&#8221; &#8211; you receive a phone call, email, or text message without warning from someone purporting to work for the government, the local council, or your bank. Emails and text messages will nearly always contain a link (or links) to a website into which you&#8217;ll be asked to enter your personal information and financial information to receive your &#8220;refund&#8221; or &#8220;grant&#8221; or make payment for the &#8220;fine&#8221; you&#8217;ve incurred.</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>&#8221; – you’d being asked for detailed personal information and financial information including <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">your National Insurance</a> number, home address (or office address), personal details, bank details, or credit/debit card details. Remember that on a genuine call or email from HMRC, the banks, and your local council, they will never ask anyone for sensitive information.</li>\n<li>&#8220;<strong>M</strong>&#8221; &#8211; they want you to give them your money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If in doubt, don&#8217;t give them the time of day.</p>\n<p>Always stop the conversation or delete the email or text message and report it to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040 or clicking here to <a href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/reporting-fraud-and-cyber-crime\">file an online report</a>.</p>\n<h3>Coronavirus (COVID 19) email scams to watch out for</h3>\n<p>HMRC have recently become aware of an email scam circulating inviting self-employed people and company owners to apply for a grant &#8220;for the third wave&#8221; containing links to a bogus HMRC website address. There is no such scheme and the public is being asked to forward the email to Action Fraud immediately.</p>\n<h3>Text messages &#8211; scams to watch out for</h3>\n<h4>&#8220;COVID-19 refund&#8221; text message scams</h4>\n<p>The &#8220;COVID-19 refund&#8221; SMS scam is similar to the email scam above &#8211; it also contains a link to a fraudulent website and the public is being asked to send reports of scammers’ attempts to deceive them to Action Fraud immediately.</p>\n<h4>&#8220;New lockdown support plan&#8221; text message scams</h4>\n<p>The typical &#8220;new lockdown support plan&#8221; SMS scam states that <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"171\">HMRC</a> are offering to give you a tax refund (the amount of which is included in the text) and this also contains a link to a fraudulent HMRC website. Again, this is a scam and you should report it to Action Fraud as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>Stopping yourself or your company becoming a victim of COVID scams</h3>\n<p>The two major warning signs that a scammer has got into contact with you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>you feel hurried</strong> &#8211; whenever you receive a text message, phone call, or visit to your home or business premises from someone claiming to be from the government, HMRC, the local council, or a supplier you use and they want you to act quickly, stop. Get in touch with the organisation direct if you&#8217;re not certain and check to see that it is actually them who are in touch with you. Make sure you use the contact details contained on the website of the organisation rather than the contact details on any website potential fraudsters link you to.</li>\n<li><strong>you’re being asked for something personal</strong> &#8211; your bank, the government, or a shopping website you use will never ask members of the public or their customers to transfer money over the phone or online to a new account, or (part of) your PIN code, request money for a &#8220;free gift&#8221; or &#8220;admin fee&#8221;, threaten to arrest you, or for remote access to your PC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What should you do if you&#8217;ve been scammed?</h3>\n<p>If you suspect that an interaction you&#8217;re having is fake, stop it straight away.</p>\n<p>If you have given bank or card details to a fraudster, let your bank or building society know about it straight away.</p>\n<p>To protect yourself against online scams, you should consider installing anti-virus software to ensure that the security on your desktop, tablet, or phone is completely up to date.</p>\n<h2>Support on Coronavirus Scheme Claims</h2>\n<p>For the latest information on coronavirus relief schemes, please get in touch with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>.

      "content": "<p>First introduced in 2012 and rolled out to all businesses over the following six years, workplace pensions have changed the way in which employers provided their staff with the opportunity to save for their pensions.</p>\n<p>Prior to its introduction, employers were not obliged to offer a scheme and, if they did, their employees had to opt into the scheme.</p>\n<p>The goal of the auto enrolment policy was to increase the number of people saving for their retirement because the Government was concerned about its future ability to provide state pensions at their current levels to everyone because of the fast-aging population.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>As of 2019, there are now 10 million employees who have been automatically enrolled into a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">workplace pension scheme</a> with less than 1 million of them choosing to opt out.</p>\n<p>Now, all employers have to offer a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions/\">workplace pension scheme</a> to their employees and most do so using the auto enrolment system. Click <a href=\"http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers.aspx\">here</a> for the Pension Regulator&#8217;s guide on how to set up a pension scheme for your company and how to find a provider to run it for you.</p>\n<h2>Who is entitled to a workplace pension?</h2>\n<p>Once your workplace pension scheme is set up, you must then enroll each member of staff into the scheme who fits the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they are between the ages of 22 and the State Pension age (click here for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age\">State Pension Age</a> calculator for each member of staff &#8211; the State Pension Age depends on your year of birth);</li>\n<li>they take home at least £10,000 a year before tax; and</li>\n<li>normally work in the UK (including employees based in the UK but who need to travel abroad for work).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an employee who was previously ineligible for enrolment then becomes eligible, you must enroll them and write to them informing them of their inclusion no sooner than 6 weeks of the date on which they qualify.</p>\n<h2>What is the total minimum contribution employers, employees, and the Government make into a staff member&#8217;s pension?</h2>\n<p>The overall annual minimum total contribution made to a staff member&#8217;s pension from 6 April 2019 is 8% (this is the total that you and your employee must contribute from every payment of wages) plus the Government will contribute an additional 1%.</p>\n<p>The government’s way of contributing to the new workplace pension schemes mirrors the way they’ve been making contributions for decades to standard pension schemes. As you know, when anyone invests into their pension scheme (assuming that they&#8217;re under their lifetime limit), the government tops it up.</p>\n<p>A basic rate tax payer only needs to contribute £80 to add £100 to their pension pot because the taxman contributes an additional £20. This does not just apply to basic rate tax payers though &#8211; for higher rate and additional rate payers, the taxman also tops their pensions up too.</p>\n<p>If you choose, you and employee may contribute more than the minimum required. Alternatively, you as the employer could elect to pay the 8% meaning that you entirely cover your employee&#8217;s auto enrolment contributions and they suffer no cut in take-home pay.</p>\n<p>There are four “bases” on which <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">you can calculate</a> both the contributions you need to make and the contribution rates of your company and its employees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>qualify earnings;</li>\n<li>basic pay;</li>\n<li>pensionable pay; and</li>\n<li>total pay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To show how your and your employees&#8217; auto enrolment contributions change depending on which of the four options a staff member chooses, we&#8217;ll use an example of an employee with a £32,500 basic wage, £7,500 annual sales bonus paid in commission, and a £2,500 overtime bonus giving an annual salary of £42,500 a year.</p>\n<h3>Qualifying earnings contributions example</h3>\n<p>Qualifying earnings in this case refer to pre-income tax and pre-National Insurance employment income between £6,240 and £50,000 for the 2020/21 tax year.</p>\n<p>If the employee chose this option for the 2020/21 tax year, £6,240 would have been taken from their wage of £42,500 a year leaving an amount of £36,260 on which workplace pension contributions must have been paid.</p>\n<p>The 3% employer minimum contribution would have been £1,087.80. The employee&#8217;s auto enrolment contribution would have been 4% totaling £1,450.40. The Government would have topped this up by another 1% (£362.60).</p>\n<p>This employee&#8217;s total minimum contribution this year from all three sources would have been £2,900.80 (or £241 per month in payments).</p>\n<h3>Basic pay contributions example</h3>\n<p>With the basic pay contributions scheme, only an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/payslip-calculator/\">employee&#8217;s basic wages</a> are considered when calculating each party&#8217;s total minimum contributions.</p>\n<p>Pension contributions made by you, the employer, would be 3% of £32,500 or £975.</p>\n<p>The employee&#8217;s auto enrolment contribution would be 4% totaling £1,300 and contributions made by the government would be £325.</p>\n<p>In total using the model, this employee would have £2,925 added to their pension pot (or £243.75 per month in payments) during this year.</p>\n<h3>Pensionable pay contributions</h3>\n<p>Using the pensionable pay measurement, at least 85% of a staff member’s total pay must count towards the amount on which minimum pension contributions are made.</p>\n<p>For our sample employee, we could not use this method because £10,000 of their £42,500 wage is paid from overtime and bonuses and this equals around 23.5% of their total pay.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of illustration, let&#8217;s imagine that this person&#8217;s £42,500 wage was made up of £37,500 base pay and two bonuses of £2,500 in commission for hitting sales targets and £2,500 for overtime instead.</p>\n<p>The sales and overtime bonuses account for 11.7% of total pay under this scenario meaning that, during this year, their take home pay before additions would have qualified them for the pensionable pay method.</p>\n<p>The minimum contribution made by you, the employer, would have been 3% of £37,500 or £1,125.</p>\n<p>The employee&#8217;s pension scheme contribution would have been 4% totaling a minimum amount of £1,500 and the Government contribution would have been £375.</p>\n<p>Using the pensionable pay measurement, this employee would have benefited from a total of £3,375 worth of contributions to their pension (or £281.25 per month in payments).</p>\n<h3>Total pay contributions measurement</h3>\n<p>With total pay, the contributions made by the employee, employer, and the government are based upon a percentage of the employee&#8217;s total earnings before deductions for income tax and National Insurance.</p>\n<p>So, in this case, the minimum auto enrolment contributions would be based on the gross wage figure of £42,500.</p>\n<p>The employer percentage contribution rate of 3% would apply meaning that you would pay in £1,275 to this employee&#8217;s pension. The employee percentage contribution rate of 4% would mean that they contribute £1,700 and the government pays £425.</p>\n<p>Under this scheme, the minimum contribution made annually to the employee&#8217;s pension pot is £3,825 (or £318.75 in monthly payments).</p>\n<h3>Which auto enrolment scheme is the cheapest for an employer?</h3>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">save money</a> and pay less towards your employees&#8217; pension pots every year, the qualifying earnings scheme will be the most suitable policy in most cases.</p>\n<p>The total pay scheme will likely be the most expensive in terms of overall contribution rate and amounts.</p>\n<h2>Auto enrolment and salary sacrifice</h2>\n<p>When your company makes payments towards your employees&#8217; pensions, it pays no tax or National Insurance on these contributions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you may wish to ask your employees to agree to enter a salary sacrifice arrangement.</p>\n<p>With a salary sacrifice agreement, your employees give up part of their salary in return for you making larger minimum contributions to their workplace pensions.</p>\n<p>For both employee and employer, there is an opportunity to pay less on NI with a salary sacrifice scheme and, by doing this, both parties enjoy further tax relief.</p>\n<p>You will likely have to ask each employee if they&#8217;re agreeable to a salary sacrifice scheme because, for some, it will affect their state benefits. You may have to consult a solicitor as well to find out if a salary sacrifice scheme is permissible under your staff members&#8217; current contracts of employment.</p>\n<h2>Contact us for more information</h2>\n<p>Workplace pensions are another financial and administrative burden for business. From April 2019, employer contributions on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pensions-and-auto-enrolment-what-employers-need-to-know/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"108\">employee pensions</a> went up to 3% of their earnings.</p>\n<p>For each of your employees with a workplace pension, you will be paying 16.8% in tax on top of their monthly earnings when combined with NI Employers&#8217; Contributions.</p>\n<p>But automatic enrolment and workplace pensions are a reality for us all. It&#8217;s not just employees who have been automatically enrolled into the scheme &#8211; employers have been automatically enrolled into it with little to no consultation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Work with Black and White</a> &#8211; we&#8217;ll help you set up your workplace pension scheme, find (or switch to) the right pension provider for your business, and manage your scheme month to month.</p>\n<p>To find out more, please get in touch with us today, by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contacting Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a>, populating the “Got a Question” form on the right, or calling us on our helpline 0800 140 464 for confidential advice.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Right now, a number of our clients are feeling that their resilience and their ability to rise to challenges in order to ensure their business continuity are being stretched to the limit. As a business owner myself, I can entirely empathise.</p>\n<p>We may be coming out of lockdown soon (in theory), but the effects of the last year could continue beyond the Government target dates for relaxing restrictions or raise their ugly head further down the line. If that happens, business resilience will be vital for survival, but have you given any thought to how you can improve your own business’ durability?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>What does business resilience mean?</h2>\n<p>Business resilience refers to a business’ ability to survive a shock and adapt to obstacles and disruption whilst being able to maintain business operations. This encompasses crisis management and business continuity.</p>\n<h2>What needs to be considered</h2>\n<p>The global pandemic is revealing just how the unexpected can impact a business and the people who work in it. Taking time to think about the worst case scenarios you could face and then taking initial measures to protect what’s most important within your business will give you greater control should the worst actually happen.</p>\n<p>When thinking of potential risk, you could consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure of a business-critical technology;</li>\n<li>Natural disasters, such as flooding;</li>\n<li>Cyber crime;</li>\n<li>Economic disruption;</li>\n<li>Supply chain issues;</li>\n<li>Civil unrest, such as strikes; and</li>\n<li>Another lockdown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whilst this isn&#8217;t exhaustive, it will hopefully give you a good start. Risks affect businesses in different ways and it’s important to consider what’s in your business toolbox to drive resilience against them so that you can recover. Areas which may require resilience-building include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workforce: Essential in any effort to address challenges and maintain continuity. Their ability to meet such challenges will depend on wellbeing, skills, knowledge and a sense of empowerment to make critical decisions;</li>\n<li>Operations: How do you maintain operations for a viable level of output? This is about more than physical space or equipment; cyber attacks can disable businesses and regulatory changes can severely impact the way a business operates;</li>\n<li>Commercial: Retaining existing customers, the ability to continue generating new customers and maintaining communications to underpin a viable business income; and</li>\n<li>Financial: <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">Cash flow</a>, accessibility to additional financial support, understanding financial performance and keeping a “spare” cash reserve will impact on the financial resilience of your business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Make a business resilience plan</h2>\n<p>Building resilience requires planning that incorporates both disaster recovery and continuity.

It’s all about the date you bought something or somebody bought something from you or not when payment arrives in the other person&#8217;s bank account.</p>\n<h3>What does it mean to record transactions?</h3>\n<p>When you record a transaction in bookkeeping, you add it to your business&#8217; “ledger”. What&#8217;s on your ledger shows how much profit you make in a year and how much income tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> you need to pay to HMRC.</p>\n<h2>What is cash basis accounting?</h2>\n<p>If you choose cash accounting (sometimes called the cash method or cash basis accounting) like most small business owners do, the good news is that it is very straightforward and much less complicated than the alternative.</p>\n<p>So what are the other pros and cons of the cash method?</p>\n<h3>Advantages of cash basis accounting</h3>\n<p>With this accounting approach, you really only keep track of when money comes into and goes out of your bank account.</p>\n<p>There are certain points towards the end of your VAT quarters and the financial year (if you’re self employed) where using cash accounting means that you actually pay less in taxes although the saving you make is only deferred.</p>\n<p>That’s because you don&#8217;t pay taxes on invoices you&#8217;ve issued &#8211; you only pay taxes on invoices after you get paid. We’ll show you how this works later on in the article.</p>\n<h4><strong>Disadvantages of cash basis accounting</strong></h4>\n<p>Two of the most important bookkeeping statistics in any business large or small are &#8220;accounts receivable&#8221; and &#8220;accounts payables&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Your &#8220;accounts receivable&#8221; records show you the money you&#8217;re expecting in and &#8220;accounts payable&#8221; records show you the money you have to pay out to your suppliers.</p>\n<p>Small business owners using cash accounting often don&#8217;t keep as close track on the money which is due in and due out as they should because their only way of measuring success or failure is judged by the cash in their bank account.</p>\n<p>How is this a disadvantage? You may make £20,000 worth of sales in one month but only record £10,000 worth of revenue because that&#8217;s the actual cash you received into your bank account. The level of real profit you’ve made will therefore be understated.</p>\n<p>Likewise, let’s say that you bill £20,000 revenue in one month and you receive all the money from your clients but you are also sent £40,000 worth of bills from your suppliers in that same month but you don&#8217;t intend to pay those bills until the following month.</p>\n<p>In this case, it may look like you&#8217;ve made a large profit when you&#8217;ve actually made a loss.</p>\n<p>With this accounting method, you never really get an accurate picture of the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">financial health of your business</a> and it&#8217;s much harder to know how well your business is actually doing.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s because your financial situation will be opaque to others that you&#8217;ll find it hard to raise cash for expansion or to spend on plant and machinery to grow your business if you present these types of accounts to a funder or investor.</p>\n<h2>What is accrual accounting?</h2>\n<p>Accrual accounting (sometimes called the accrual method or accrual basis accounting) is the more common approach to accounting used by companies.</p>\n<p>With accrual accounting, you record your income/revenue and expenses at the time the sale is made regardless of whether you have received money from your client or your supplier has received money from you.</p>\n<p>So what are the main pros and cons of choosing to use the accrual method?</p>\n<h3>Advantages of accrual basis accounting</h3>\n<p>Accrual accounting presents you with a much clearer vision of how your company is performing both over the long-term and historically because of its accuracy in recording the dates you sent out invoices and you received invoices from your suppliers.</p>\n<p>This recordkeeping means that you&#8217;re able to track income and expenditure accurately so that you can compare turnover and profitability on a month by month basis.</p>\n<p>Another significant advantage will be your ability to manage your accounts receivables better.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be able to check your accounts receivable records to determine how quickly individual clients pay you and manage your cashflow better.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll get to understand each clients&#8217; payment cycles and this knowledge will allow you to make better decisions on how much credit you extend to individual customers based upon how quickly they historically have settled your invoices.</p>\n<h3>Disadvantages of accrual basis accounting</h3>\n<p>The accruals method is more complicated than the cash method and you will need to spend more time on your bookkeeping.</p>\n<p>This method is also not as focused on cashflow so you could find yourself in the situation where your financial records are showing your company as having significant and profitable income despite the fact that there might be little or no money in your bank account.</p>\n<p>There will also likely be certain points in the year when you pay taxes on money you&#8217;ve not received when you use the accrual method.</p>\n<h2>Cash vs accrual accounting &#8211; real world example</h2>\n<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, revenue/income and expenses are recorded differently depending on whether you use the cash basis or accrual basis of accounting for your company.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at an example and what it might mean for small business owners.</p>\n<h3>Record of revenues &#8211; example</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that Pete runs a training company and he provided a health and safety training course to a client on 10th March for £1,000 + VAT (£1,200 including VAT). He issues the invoice on the same day but his client doesn&#8217;t pay him until the 28th April.</p>\n<p>With cash basis accounting, Pete would record the sale into his bookkeeping package on 28th April, the day on which he was paid.</p>\n<p>With accrual basis accounting, Pete would have recorded the sale on the 10th March, the day he carried out the work and issued the invoice from his <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-software-implementation-training-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">bookkeeping software</a>.</p>\n<h3>Record of expenses &#8211; example</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that, in order to be able to provide that health and safety training course, Pete needed to purchase an overhead projector.</p>\n<p>He bought it from his supplier on 4th March for £500 + VAT (£600 including VAT) and he waited until he got paid from his client before paying his supplier. This means that Pete made payment to his supplier on the 28th April.</p>\n<p>Using cash accounting where your revenue/income and expenses are booked on the day you get paid and the day you pay your suppliers, Pete would record this transaction on 28th April.</p>\n<p>Using accrual accounting, your expenses are recorded when the deal is done meaning that he would log this transaction into his bookkeeping system on the 4th March upon receipt of the invoice from his supplier.</p>\n<h3>Income tax/VAT consequences &#8211; example</h3>\n<p>So, what are the consequences of using either of these accounting methods for Pete with respect to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax</a> and VAT?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that March was the last month of Pete&#8217;s VAT quarter. If he were using the accrual method, he would have to record both transactions in his <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-apps-bookkeeping-software-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">bookkeeping software</a> as happening in the month of March and they would both be reflected in the VAT bill he pays in May.</p>\n<p>However, by using cash accounting, both transactions would not be recorded until the month of April which is inside the following VAT quarter. This means that these transactions would be reflected in the VAT bill he pays in August. So that&#8217;s better for his cashflow.</p>\n<p>What about income tax and National Insurance Class 4?</p>\n<p>The financial year runs from the 6 April to the 5th April. If Pete were using the accrual method, both transactions would be caught in the current tax year and this would be reflected in his Self Assessment which is payable the following January.</p>\n<p>However, if he were using the cash basis method, he would record both transactions in his bookkeeping software in the month of April in the following financial year. This means that these transactions would be reflected in the next Self Assessment form meaning any taxes due on it would be paid a year later than with the accrual method.</p>\n<p>In essence, choosing between the accrual and cash basis methods has implications for the timing of tax payments in self-assessment. For individuals like Pete, understanding these nuances becomes crucial, and seeking <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">guidance from a qualified self-assessment accountant</a> can ensure optimal financial planning aligned with the chosen accounting approach.</p>\n<p>As you can see from this example, the major benefit of cash accounting is its positive consequences for cash flow but you should not be solely persuaded by that fact to choose this method.</p>\n<p>In fact, if your choice of this accounting method is purely the short term deferral of taxes, then you may need to ask wider questions about your business and its ability to manage money.</p>\n<h2>Cash vs accrual accounting Quick FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Should a small business use cash or accrual accounting?</h3>\n<p>It depends on which one of these two accounting methods works better for your small business.</p>\n<p>If you take payment at the point of order and the gap in time between getting the stock you require and selling it to end users is brief, accrual accounting would probably be better as it will give you a better indication of your businesses&#8217; performance and there is no real cashflow advantage in this situation.</p>\n<p>If your small business invoices clients and you give them an extended period of time upon completion of the job, there will almost certainly be cash flow advantages for you with the cash accounting method.</p>\n<p>If your small business has &#8220;lumpy cash flow&#8221; where the payments you receive are generally large and do not occur regularly and where you invoice clients with 30+ days&#8217; notice, there are distinct cash flow advantages to using cash accounting however it will be more difficult to measure at any given time the true performance of your business.</p>\n<p>As you can see, this is a tough question to answer because of the number of variables involved.</p>\n<p>You should discuss your priorities with your accountant prior to make a decision on which accounting method you select.</p>\n<h3>Can you use both cash and accrual accounting?</h3>\n<p>Yes and no.</p>\n<p>Many small businesses use something called &#8220;hybrid accounting&#8221;. You can keep two sets of books &#8211; cash books and accrual books (although you only present one to the taxman).</p>\n<p>Many small business owners use cash accounting for the purposes of minimising VAT in particular but they&#8217;ll use their accrual books to base big decisions on like whether their company has enough money to invest in new equipment or expand or whether they&#8217;ll <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">have to borrow money</a> instead.</p>\n<p>Please note that sole traders and partners are permitted to use cash accounting for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Self Assessment tax return</a> purposes (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/simpler-income-tax-cash-basis/who-can-use-cash-basis\">with a few exceptions</a>). <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-liability-partnership-services/\">Limited companies and limited liability partnerships</a> can’t use the cash basis method for the assessment of their taxes.</p>\n<h2>Stay on the right track with accurate bookkeeping from Black and White</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> works with businesses using both accrual accounting and cash accounting methods – we have decades of collective experience in both and we look forward to sharing our knowledge and insights with you.

Financial accounting differs from management accounting in that respect as management accounting is intended for an internal audience &#8211; a company&#8217;s leadership team.</p>\n<p>Financial accounting needs to be much more exact than management accounting because it must adhere to, for example, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In comparison, the insights provided by management accounting are often educated estimates based upon deep knowledge of a fluid situation &#8211; fluid in the sense that this is day-to-day, short-term, and long-term management of trading business in an uncertain world.</p>\n<p>All listed companies need financial accounting. Financial accounting is a requirement for most external investors in private limited companies too &#8211; investors want monthly financial statements, general accounting information, and performance management information to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-business-development-and-health-checks-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">check on how well a business they’ve invested in is doing</a>.</p>\n<h2>Types of managerial accounting performance metrics</h2>\n<p>Management accounting/cost accounting data provides multiple insights into a business&#8217; financial performance. Below, we describe some of the most important work carried out by managerial accountants:</p>\n<h3>Budgeting, Trend Analysis, and Forecasting</h3>\n<p>Budgeting – the setting of a budget for the entire company and budgets for each individual department – allows corporate leaders to analyse the financial performance and each department’s abilities to control costs. It also allows leaders to alter spending priorities depending on how well the company is doing, For example, a management accountant may suggest an increase in available budget for the marketing and sales department if revenues are declining.</p>\n<p>Budgeting is also used in decision-making when planning expansion or for capital expenditure spending. Potential gains can be forecast from an expansion or from investment in capital equipment to decide whether a project under consideration is worthwhile and in determining the payback period required to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">protect cash flow</a> if the expansion or investment requires external funding.</p>\n<h3>Accounts Receivables Management</h3>\n<p>Accounts receivables management accounting involves analysing the length of time it takes individual clients to settle their invoices. Managerial accounting analysis can help a sales department or a credit control department determine the amount of short-term credit given to individual clients or whether credit terms should continue to be offered to persistent late payers.</p>\n<h3>Financial Leverage Metrics</h3>\n<p>Leverage refers to how a company uses <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">borrowed money</a> to increase its return on the investments its made and for the acquisition of assets. Management accounting data allows a company&#8217;s leadership team to determine how it can best balance debt and equity so that it extracts the maximum value at the lowest risk in its borrowing activities.</p>\n<p>Management accountants provide information on return on invested capital, debt to equity ratios, and return on equity to company leaders when they’re making decisions on future strategy. The insights provided by a managerial accountant are then often used by leaders to explain their decision-making processes to board members, creditors, and investors.</p>\n<h3>Constraint analysis</h3>\n<p>Managerial accounting gives companies the operational insight and information they need to improve efficiency in the production and sales processes.</p>\n<p>Management accountants, for example, can help manufacturing companies determine where production and sales bottlenecks occur to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide analysis on their effects of cash flow, profile, control of costs, and company revenue and</li>\n<li>provide justification for expenditure to reduce or eliminate these issues by comparing the cost involved with the likely gains from that expenditure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stock turnover analysis</h3>\n<p>Management accountants use stock turnover analysis to determine the number of times a business has sold and replaced internal stock during a given time-period.</p>\n<p>Managerial accounting data can determine how much carrying unsold stock is costing a company as well as providing management with accounting reports showing how much could be saved by stocking with a “just in time” approach.</p>\n<p>These savings may then be used to aid decision-making in stock purchasing policy and cycles, marketing, manufacturing, and pricing.</p>\n<h3>Cash flow analysis</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cash-versus-accrual-accounting/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"26\">Cash flow analysis accounting</a> involves providing reports to management on the impact decisions being made have on available cash within the business.</p>\n<p>Cash flow analysis allows companies to determine whether they can invest in new assets outright or whether they should borrow money to acquire them as well as ensuring that the company has enough liquid assets and cash to cover their short-term obligations.</p>\n<h3>Product costing and valuation</h3>\n<p>For manufacturers, product costing and evaluation clearly shows all of the costs involved in the production or assembly of goods including indirect costs, direct costs, variable costs, and fixed costs.</p>\n<p>This is then often used to determine whether the optimal desired level of profit is being made and whether certain production processes should be brought in-house or outsourced for greater efficiency.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s it like to work with a management accountant?</h2>\n<p>Becoming a management accountant is a career choice which appeals particularly to the more business-minded professionals within our sector.</p>\n<p>Managerial accountants share many of the best characteristics, skills, and traits of entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>They are highly motivated to hit the goals they have set for themselves and they want the companies they work for to thrive and to soundly beat their competitors.</p>\n<p>Numbers and figures are important to managerial accountants but, for them, this is just the starting point.</p>\n<p>Contained within your current and past accounting records is valuable financial and non-financial information about your company&#8217;s ongoing strategic performance, ways to generate greater shareholder value, your exposure to risk, and your ability to stick within the budgets you set for the company.</p>\n<p>Managerial accountants can see this whereas most professional accountants and entrepreneurs can&#8217;t &#8211; that&#8217;s why they are so valuable to so many boards.</p>\n<p>When you first start working with management accountants, they&#8217;ll quickly develop a knowledge of your corporate operations and systems with a view on how to streamline them for greater efficiency and profitability.</p>\n<p>More than likely, they&#8217;ll also uncover unnecessary costs you might not know about which have affected your bottom line for years.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ll predict the potential positive and negative consequences of business decisions you make (or don&#8217;t make). Using their skills of analysis, they&#8217;ll prepare for you and your management team alternative approaches to the problems and opportunities your company faces.</p>\n<p>Over time, they&#8217;ll help you negotiate and obtain any finance you need for growth or for major projects and they&#8217;ll develop and manage your company&#8217;s financial policies and systems.</p>\n<h2>Working with Black &amp; White&#8217;s experienced management accountants</h2>\n<p>Many business leaders pin much of the success they&#8217;ve enjoyed on the strategic business insights and planning provided to them by their professional management accountants.

      "content": "<p>In the ten years and more since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) have agreed many more late payment plans to help out individuals and companies who temporarily do not have the money needed to settle their forthcoming tax bills in full.</p>\n<p>Self-employed individuals and directors can spread the cost of the taxes they owe as reported on their Self-Assessment forms over time up to 12 months. Businesses and limited companies can arrange payment plans for any soon-to-be-outstanding Corporation Tax, VAT, and PAYE liabilities they have incurred.</p>\n<p>The scheme under which you and the taxman agree a payment plan is called &#8220;HMRC Time To Pay&#8221; (TTP).</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In this article, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black And White Accounting</a> shares with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What TTP is;</li>\n<li>Who you ask for a TTP arrangement from;</li>\n<li>COVID 19 and special Time To Pay Arrangement provisions;</li>\n<li>Time To Pay Arrangements quick FAQs;</li>\n<li>The Black &amp; White Time To Pay Arrangement (TTP) assessment plan; and</li>\n<li>How to get in touch with one of our accountants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is HMRC TTP?</h2>\n<p>TTP has existed in one form or another for decades.</p>\n<p>The thinking behind the scheme is that it&#8217;s better to give you time and space to pay your tax bill than chase you through the courts if you cannot pay what you owe.</p>\n<p>Any tax, duty, penalties or surcharges that you cannot afford to pay can be included in your HMRC TTP arrangement. A TTP arrangement can cover either personal taxes like Income Tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> or business taxes like Corporation Tax, VAT, and PAYE.</p>\n<p>With a TTP arrangement, HMRC allows you to pay back your debt to them over a period of up to a year. They collect a payment every month by direct debit from your bank account and, with each payment, the level of your debt to them is reduced.</p>\n<p>Whatever you and the taxman agree to in your HMRC TTP arrangement, you must stick to it.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you request a deal before the tax is due because, then, all penalties, surcharges, and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-much-interest-do-hmrc-charge/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"197\">interest you would be charged</a> is then suspended. However, please make sure that you meet each monthly payment otherwise they will likely be reapplied to your account.</p>\n<p>That said, agreements are not set in stone and the taxman can be very flexible.</p>\n<p>If you meet each monthly direct debit on time and in full, you may be allowed to add further tax liabilities you don’t have the funds for onto your arrangement with them.</p>\n<p>Be honest, open, and transparent with them and they will nearly always return the favour to you.</p>\n<h2>Do you request a TTP arrangement directly from HMRC?</h2>\n<p>Yes &#8211; you must <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-do-i-contact-hmrc-by-phone/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"30\">contact HMRC directly</a> to request a personal or company TTP plan – one type of plan is automatically granted and the other you have to call up and ask for.</p>\n<h3>Option 1 &#8211; no need to call HMRC</h3>\n<p>If you want more time to settle the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal taxes</a> you owe as you reported on your Self-Assessment, you do not need to call and speak to an HMRC representative.</p>\n<p>You can apply to set up an online payment plan by <a href=\"https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds?_ga=2.166459518.175569883.1615397874-1883489133.1585813825\">clicking here</a> as long as you’re within 60 days of the payment deadline passing, you have no other HMRC debt, and you owe £30,000 or less.</p>\n<p>You can, if you wish, use this system to make monthly payments against the tax you owe instead of the two annual payments you normally make under the &#8220;payment on account system&#8221;.</p>\n<h3>Option 2 &#8211; you need to call HMRC and explain your circumstances</h3>\n<p>If option 1 isn&#8217;t right for your personal or business circumstances or if you instead wish to make an arrangement to pay off other taxes like Corporation Tax, VAT, or PAYE over up to a year, you need to call HMRC&#8217;s helpline to apply.</p>\n<p>When you contact HMRC, they will ask you a number of questions the answers to which will determine whether they&#8217;re prepared come to an agreement with you.</p>\n<p>Before you call, prepare yourself for the following requests and questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they&#8217;ll need the reference number of the bill you&#8217;re currently not able to pay;</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll also ask you which other debt you have to HMRC and the time period in which those debts accrued which you currently cannot afford to pay and whether you wish to include them in your TTP agreement;</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll want to know why you cannot pay and what your current financial circumstances are;</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll ask how much you could pay now &#8211; for example, if you could pay a quarter of what you owe right now and then settle the rest over a period of up to a year;</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll want to know what efforts you’ve already put in place to try to find the money from other sources;</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll want reassurance that, in the future, your finances will change for the better and that you&#8217;re less likely to fall into arrears with them; and</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll be less likely to offer you a TTP agreement if they believe that you or your business is at risk of insolvency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If they believe that you’ll be able to stick to your agreement with them, they&#8217;ll ask you to provide them with your bank account details so you can set up a Direct Debit for your arrangement.</p>\n<p>When you negotiate with HMRC, start from the position that you&#8217;ll likely need a maximum period of time (a year) to pay back your arrears and ASK for it. Consider the outcome you want carefully because, if you ask for too short a length of time, you may be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">building up cash flow</a> problems for you and/or your company in the near future.</p>\n<p>The lower each monthly payment you make, the more you can afford each repayment so that’s why you should ask for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>They will likely try to negotiate you into a tighter window of time as they want you to pay off your debt to them as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Try your best to defend your position or, better still, get your accountant or tax agent to do it for you.</p>\n<h2>Coronavirus (COVID 19), the self employed, and HMRC TTP</h2>\n<p>As part of the government&#8217;s financial response to the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, it made an offer in March 2020 to taxpayers who complete Self-Assessment forms but whose sales and cash flow have suffered as a result of the crisis.</p>\n<p>If your income and circumstances have been negatively affected by the Coronavirus outbreak, you can pay taxes due as reported on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your Self-Assessment tax return</a> in monthly instalments instead, so you didn’t have to find so much money in one go.</p>\n<p>This offer originally included delayed (deferred) ‘payments on account’ that were due in July 2020 &#8211; you could now <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">pay your tax returns</a> in January 2021 although this deadline has now passed.</p>\n<p>The Self-Assessment Payment helpline number is <strong>0300 200</strong> <strong>3822</strong>. It&#8217;s open Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.</p>\n<p>In addition, taxpayers whose income was affected by the crisis and whose drop in income has meant that they cannot afford to pay debts and arrears owed to HMRC may also apply for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme. You can apply for the fourth financial grant under this scheme from April 2021. If you&#8217;ve been financially impacted by the pandemic and need assistance with your Self-Assessment payments, then the support of a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">local self-assessment accountant</a> can provide valuable insights and help navigate the available options.</p>\n<h2>HMRC TTP Arrangements Quick FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Will HMRC give me TTP?</h3>\n<p>HMRC are not obliged to agree a TTP arrangement with you but, in our experience, they are very willing to listen and help both personal and corporate taxpayers.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to convince HMRC that you are not able to pay the money in any other way (including taking out debt) and that you will make the repayments on time.</p>\n<h3>How long do you have to pay HMRC?</h3>\n<p>Most HMRC TTP arrangements are made to last between 6 and 12 months. While HMRC are agreeable to a shorter time scale to pay them back, they rarely extend the time they give you to pay beyond a year.</p>\n<h3>How must I make TTP repayments?</h3>\n<p>HMRC will collect TTP payments from your account once a month by direct debit.</p>\n<h3>Can TTP be used by individuals or companies likely to be subject to insolvency proceedings?</h3>\n<p>If you or your company is insolvent or at risk of insolvency, you must disclose this during your call to HMRC. However, insolvency means that your request is likely to be rejected.</p>\n<h3>What happens if you can&#8217;t pay HMRC back with a TTP arrangement?</h3>\n<p>If HMRC are unable to take payment from your direct debit, they&#8217;ll first contact you to ask why TTP payment could not be collected.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unable to stick to the agreement, they cannot get in touch with you, or they feel that they can&#8217;t negotiate with you, the bill will become immediately payable in full.</p>\n<p>You may then be subject to legal action like insolvency proceedings or country court proceedings.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a field officer may visit you at home or at your business&#8217;s premises.</p>\n<h3>When should PAYE be paid to HMRC?</h3>\n<p>If you cannot meet your PAYE bill on time, you need to contact HMRC to arrange extra time to pay as soon as you know.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, you need to make payment in full of your PAYE liabilities by the 22nd of the month (or 19th of the month if you complete paper-based forms).</p>\n<h3>Are late filing and payment penalties suspended with a TTP arrangement?</h3>\n<p>Late filing and payment penalties are generally suspended following the arrangement of a TTP arrangement.</p>\n<p>However please be aware that these penalties may be reapplied if you break your arrangement with HMRC.</p>\n<h3>Is interest on overdue tax suspended if HMRC agree to give me longer to pay the tax owed to them?</h3>\n<p>Yes &#8211; interest is suspended when an agreement with HMRC is made however, as with late filing and payment penalties, they may reapply that interest to your account if you are unable to fulfil your financial obligations to HMRC.</p>\n<h2>The Black &amp; White HMRC TTP Arrangement assessment plan</h2>\n<p>Have you found this page because you cannot make a payment you owe to HMRC within the time period allowed?</p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t panic about it &#8211; millions of requests are made for extra time to pay every year and you are not alone.</p>\n<p>Despite the sometimes-fearsome reputation of HMRC, they are genuinely understanding, willing to help, and they are normally happy to extend the time you have to settle your bill on your initial phone call. Some say, they are the second most generous lender in the market, second only to the bank of mum and dad.</p>\n<p>If you want to talk with one of our accountants about coming to a TTP arrangement with the taxman, please get in touch.</p>\n<p>Is there a way you can avoid taking out an arrangement? Although there&#8217;s no actual evidence to suggest that you&#8217;re more likely to be turned down for time to pay but let&#8217;s try not to test the theory.</p>\n<p>Ask us about our TTP assessment plan. Here, we&#8217;ll take the following steps to help you get your tax affairs and debt in order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>assess the situation</strong> &#8211; let&#8217;s look at how much the soon-to-be-outstanding tax bill is and the amount of cash you have available in your business bank account;</li>\n<li><strong>future income</strong> &#8211; which payments are you expecting from your clients between now and when the bill is due?;</li>\n<li><strong>what&#8217;s going out</strong> &#8211; what debts will your company have to clear between now and the due date of the tax bill? If you are in arrears to your suppliers, can we contact them to let them know that you&#8217;re going through temporary financial turbulence? You&#8217;ll be surprised just how many suppliers will help their clients when they&#8217;re in temporary need;</li>\n<li><strong>general cash flow issues</strong> &#8211; is the problem being caused by clients paying you too slowly and is it the case that they&#8217;ve been paying you particularly slowly of late?

When closing a limited company, you always have to inform HMRC.</p>\n<p>There are always many loose ends you’ll need to tie up before the process is complete.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to make sure that all of your company&#8217;s bills to your suppliers are settled as well as making sure that all of your clients have paid you in full.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to ensure that there&#8217;s enough money to cover your general running costs before your company is struck off the register and you&#8217;ll likely to have pay solicitors and accountants to assist you with the dissolution.</p>\n<p>The costs of closing a company are legitimate and claimable business expenses which you can use to reduce your liability for your final <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax bill</a>. And, on that subject&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Corporation Tax</h3>\n<p>You need to prepare your final accounts (sometimes called cessation accounts) and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Company Tax Returns</a> and send them to HMRC stating that these are your company&#8217;s final trading accounts and that your company will be dissolved. HMRC should send you no further reminders or CT600s from that point.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White thought </strong></em>&#8211; will you make a loss in your final year of trading? If so, you can offset that loss and set them off against your profits from the previous three years. The situation becomes more complicated if you want to transfer your trade to another person &#8211; please ask us for more information.</p>\n<h3>VAT (if applicable)</h3>\n<p>To deregister for VAT, you need to complete a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-to-cancel-your-vat-registration-vat7\">VAT 7 form</a>.</p>\n<p>On receipt, you&#8217;ll hear from HMRC what your deregistration date is going to be. You must continue to keep <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/value-added-tax/\">Making Tax Digital-compliant VAT</a> records up to this date.</p>\n<p>On your final VAT return, you (or your accountant) must take into account any equipment, company assets, or leftover stock still owned by your business.</p>\n<h3>PAYE (if applicable)</h3>\n<p>You (or your accountant) also need to let HMRC know that you no longer need to operate a PAYE scheme &#8211; you can do so at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/stop-employing-staff\">this link</a>. You&#8217;ll need to complete either a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc\">Full Payment Submission (FPS)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc-eps\">Employer Payment Summary (EPS)</a>. You&#8217;ll need to make a final pay of income tax you&#8217;ve collected from your staff, your Employee <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance Contributions</a>, and your Employer National Insurance Contributions.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need to give your employees a P45 on their last day, enter a leaving date onto each staff member&#8217;s payroll records, and send in your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/reporting-and-paying\">expenses and benefits</a> returns.</p>\n<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</a> is more a consideration for contractors and freelancers who have used personal service companies for trading purposes because, in many cases, it&#8217;s more tax efficient to operate in this way.</p>\n<p>Many contractors and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">freelancers</a> use equipment like laptops, mobile phones, and software both in a personal and professional capacity. If you end up taking full personal ownership of these assets when you close the company, you may be liable for CGT.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White thought </strong></em>&#8211; Depending on what assets are left in the company, it might be more tax efficient to apply entrepreneurs&#8217; relief on the final withdrawals from the company, which is discussed more below.</p>\n<h2>What does &#8220;solvent&#8221; and &#8220;insolvent&#8221; mean?</h2>\n<p>The options open to you to close the company you own will depend greatly on whether it is trading solvently or insolvently.</p>\n<p>If your company&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has more assets than liabilities;</li>\n<li>is able to promptly pay off its debts on time and in full to HMRC and other creditors; and/or</li>\n<li>has no legal action has been started against your company in excess of £750.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230;yours is likely a solvent company. With a solvent company, there will often be cash and assets left when your company no longer exists which will be distributed to shareholders prior to dissolution.</p>\n<p>If your company</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has more liabilities than assets;</li>\n<li>may not be able to promptly pay off its debts on time and in full to HMRC and other creditors; and/or</li>\n<li>legal action has been started against your company in excess of £750.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230;yours is likely an insolvent company.</p>\n<h2>How do I close a solvent limited company?</h2>\n<h3>Strike off your company</h3>\n<p>To close your solvent company (sometimes called “winding up your limited company”), you apply for it to be struck off the register at Companies House.</p>\n<p>There are certain conditions you have to fulfil to have your company struck off the record and they are that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your company have no current agreements with creditors like a company voluntary arrangement;</li>\n<li>your company has not changed names in the last 3 months;</li>\n<li>your company has not been threatened with liquidation;</li>\n<li>your company has no existing debts; and</li>\n<li>your company hasn’t traded or sold any of its shares or stock in the last 3 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have, for example, changed your company name or sold goods and services to clients in the last three months, you do not meet the requirements necessary to strike off your company and you will need to consider a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation (MVL) instead.</p>\n<p>If you do satisfy these requirements, you or your accountant can apply to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/companies-house-forms/\">Companies House for a form</a> DS01. You can obtain a form DS01 on the gov.uk website by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strike-off-a-company-from-the-register-ds01\">clicking here</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White thought </strong></em>&#8211; striking off your company (dissolution) is a less complicated and more tax efficient option for companies where there are retained profits of £25,000 or less. Although all shareholders might be subject to CGT, there is an annual allowance of £12,300 on which you won&#8217;t pay CGT. If there are retained profits of more than £25,000, shareholders will normally receive a final dividend. If this is the case, a Liquidator will have to be appointed to manage the closure, as detailed in MVL section below.</p>\n<h3>MVL</h3>\n<p>An MVL is generally the most tax efficient option for company directors and shareholders to obtain the value of the company where there are assets left to distribute.</p>\n<p>For an MVL to occur, the following needs to happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>75% or more of the company directors need to sign a &#8220;declaration of solvency&#8221;;</li>\n<li>shareholders then need to pass a resolution authorising the voluntary winding up of the company;</li>\n<li>this winding up resolution needs to be published in the Gazette within 14 days;</li>\n<li>you must inform Companies House of your decision within 15 days of the resolution being passed; and</li>\n<li>the company directors and shareholders then need to appoint an authorised insolvency practitioner to take over the process. Upon appointment, the authorised insolvency practitioner then takes full charge of the limited company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White thought </strong></em>&#8211; the cost of MVL normally starts from £2,000 + VAT, with the actual price dependent on how complex the process will be. You should consult with an accountant prior to choosing which of the two options (being struck off or an MVL) is most tax efficient for you and for each company director and shareholder. If it can unlock Entrepreneurs&#8217; Relief the cost of the Liquidator can often be outweighed by the tax saving, which is why MVL&#8217;s are often a popular option for directors and shareholders.</p>\n<h3>What happens if I try to close my company and it owes money to HMRC and/or other creditors?</h3>\n<p>If you try to strike off a limited company or initiate an MVL procedure when it owes tax to HMRC or it has unpaid debts to its creditors, they may raise an &#8220;Objection to Company Strike Off&#8221; with Companies House.</p>\n<p>If they do raise this objection, you will almost certainly not be about to proceed with striking off or your liquidation until any and all outstanding amounts are paid off in full, or an agreement is made. An accountant or Liquidator can help you through this to make it as easy as possible for you.</p>\n<h2>Closing an insolvent limited company</h2>\n<p>There are two main routes which lead to the closure of your company if your company is insolvent &#8211; a Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) or a compulsory liquidation.</p>\n<h3>CVL</h3>\n<p>A CVL is a director-led process and the way you start one is very similar to the process of initiating an MVL. A CVL is designed for companies whose liabilities are greater than their assets or which can&#8217;t pay its bills.</p>\n<p>You appoint an Insolvency Practitioner to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>collect all outstanding debts owed to your company;</li>\n<li>inform and involve HMRC and other relevant governmental bodies including Companies House in the process;</li>\n<li>handle employee claims; and</li>\n<li>distribute remaining proceeds to creditors in the order of priority set down by the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-corporate-insolvency-and-governance-act/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"205\">Insolvency Act</a> 1986.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compulsory liquidation</h3>\n<p>Unlike a CVL, which is initiated by the directors and shareholders, a compulsory liquidation is a forcible attempt to shut down a company which its creditors have come to believe is insolvent.</p>\n<p>Normally started by one creditor of a company (on many occasions HMRC), the compulsory liquidation process normally begins with a &#8220;Winding-Up Petition&#8221;. The Winding Up Petition is sent to the company when the company owes the creditor more than £750 and payment of the debt is 21 days or more late.</p>\n<p>If the petition is granted, a notice will appear in the Gazette at which point the company’s bank account will generally be frozen.</p>\n<p>Seven days after the petition is granted, a court judge then makes the decision on whether a &#8220;Winding Up Order&#8221; should be granted.</p>\n<p>If they issue the order, the judge then appoints an Official Receiver (sometimes called a liquidator). The Official Receiver takes over control of the company and all existing directors will have no further involvement in the running of the company.</p>\n<p>The Official Receiver then begins to liquidate the company&#8217;s assets including its machinery, property, vehicles, and stock. The proceeds of the sales of these assets (together with any remaining cash held in the company&#8217;s bank account) will then be used to repay the company&#8217;s debts. After this is completed, the company will be closed down and struck off the register at Companies House.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White thought </strong></em>&#8211; in this situation, you need representation from a solicitor and an accountant to try to protect you from any effort to hold you personally responsible for the company&#8217;s debts and from disqualification as a director.</p>\n<h2>Closing companies and Coronavirus</h2>\n<p>During the Coronavirus, there have been changes to the wrongful trading laws and Companies House have also paused the closure of companies for periods. It is therefore not business as usual, so even more than usual if you find yourself wanting to close a solvent or insolvent company we recommend taking professional advice to ensure the best outcome for you.</p>\n<h2>How to close a limited company Quick FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Can I close a company and start a new one?</h3>\n<p>Yes unless you have been barred from being a director. There are some anti-avoidance rules though, so you might have to be careful here.</p>\n<h3>Returning to sole trader status</h3>\n<p>Many accountants advice clients running limited companies to return to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">being a sole trader</a> if their level of annual profits are less than £30,000. However, every individual case is different and we&#8217;d strongly recommend that you take advice.</p>\n<h3>How do you close a company which is dormant or which has never traded?</h3>\n<p>You need to use a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">DS01 form</a> to close a dormant company or a company which has never traded.</p>\n<h2>Expert help to close a limited company from experienced accountants</h2>\n<p>As you can see from our article, there are many different ways to close a company &#8211; some of these methods you initiate and some of them are initiated by HMRC and company creditors.

      "content": "<p>One subject us tax accountants get asked the most is Value Added Tax (&#8216;VAT&#8217;). What in theory should be quite a simple tax is actually really hard for many business owners to administer in practice.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll cover everything from how to work out VAT to when you need to add VAT to sales and claim it back on expenses.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Key topics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What VAT is;</li>\n<li>The different rates of VAT and how they affect the gross &amp; net sales prices of the products and services you sell;</li>\n<li>Working out your VAT bill;</li>\n<li>How to use a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vat-calculator/\">VAT calculator; and</a></li>\n<li>Three Black &amp; White Accounting action plans for your business and VAT.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is VAT?</h2>\n<p>VAT was first introduced into the UK by the government in 1973 replacing the then controversial Purchase Tax.</p>\n<p>If a business is registered for VAT, it must then always add VAT at the applicable rate to the price at which it sells its products and services to its customers.</p>\n<h3>VAT and the price of goods and services</h3>\n<p>Generally, if a business sells to consumers, it generally displays the prices of its goods and services including (inclusive of) VAT (sometimes called the gross amount or the total price to the customer).</p>\n<p>When a VAT-registered business is selling to another VAT-registered business or public sector organisation, it will normally advertise the prices of its products and services excluding (exclusive of) VAT (sometimes called the net amount).</p>\n<p>In both situations however, when a consumer, business, or public sector body purchases a product or service from a VAT-registered business, the money which changes hands will always be the VAT inclusive amount.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re registered for VAT, adding VAT at the standard percentage rate or whichever percentage rate applies is a legal requirement &#8211; you can&#8217;t opt out of it.</p>\n<p>So then why the difference in how companies advertise prices depending on who they sell to?</p>\n<p>Because when a business is registered for VAT, it can claim back the VAT on goods and services it has bought in. This means that the true price a VAT-registered customer pays is actually the VAT exclusive price.</p>\n<p>This, of course, affects what you pay in VAT to HMRC when your bill is due. We&#8217;ll explain <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">how you calculate your VAT</a> bill later on in this article.</p>\n<h2>What is the current VAT rate?</h2>\n<p>The standard national rate of VAT in the UK is 20% on nearly all items sold.</p>\n<p>Following the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the standard VAT rate was briefly reduced to 17.5%. However, on the 4 January 2011, it went back up to 20% and it has remained there ever since.</p>\n<p>At time of writing (2021), rates are not expected to change even as the government looks for additional revenue following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to work out VAT on goods and services</strong></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example.</p>\n<p>So, when adding VAT to the price you want to charge a customer, you take the base amount &#8211; say £100 &#8211; and add the standard 20% rate to that.</p>\n<p>The VAT exclusive price (price without VAT/net amount) is £100, the VAT inclusive price (price including VAT/gross amount/total price) is £120, and the amount of VAT charged in that transaction is £20 of the price paid by the end user.</p>\n<p>Not all products and services have the standard rate of VAT applied to their price though.</p>\n<h3>How to calculate the reduced VAT rate of 5%</h3>\n<p>There is a reduced VAT of 5% applying to a limited range of products and services like children&#8217;s car seats and gas &amp; electricity bills.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how this applies to smoking cessation products which are 5% rated.</p>\n<p>How would you calculate the amount of VAT at the reduced VAT rate on these products?</p>\n<p>If you wanted to sell a smoking cessation product for £10, the price you&#8217;d sell it at would have to include 5% VAT.</p>\n<p>When calculating the VAT for this, you would divide the £10 by 1.05.</p>\n<p>This calculation will show you the VAT exclusive price £9.52.</p>\n<p>To determine the amount of VAT you charge, you subtract the price including VAT of £10 from the price excluding VAT of £9.52. This means that you’ve charged the customer the VAT amount of 48p on the transaction.</p>\n<h3>Working with the 0% VAT rate</h3>\n<p>There are a number of products and services to which you don&#8217;t add VAT to the price because they are zero-rated for VAT, mainly food stuffs.</p>\n<h2>How to calculate your VAT bill</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re registered for VAT, you normally have to pay a bill every quarter to HMRC. You have around 5 weeks to report how much you owe and to make payment in full.</p>\n<p>To calculate your final bill, you need to do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>work out your output VAT (this is the total amount of VAT you&#8217;ve charged customers in the three month period)</li>\n<li>work out your input VAT (this is what you&#8217;ve paid in VAT to your suppliers on purchases your business has made which include VAT)</li>\n<li>Subtract 1 from 2</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the sum is positive, you owe HMRC that amount. If the sum is negative, HMRC owes you that amount.</p>\n<p>Many businesses find that paying HMRC quarterly puts too much pressure on their cash flow. There is a monthly payment option available if that would suit you better.</p>\n<p>However there are a number of other VAT schemes for you to choose from.</p>\n<h3>What are the different types of VAT schemes?</h3>\n<p>There are six main VAT schemes as follows:</p>\n<h4>1. Flat rate VAT scheme</h4>\n<p>Companies on the flat rate VAT scheme pay VAT differently to the example we’ve just shown above.</p>\n<p>Unlike with the standard VAT system, you can&#8217;t claim back the VAT on your expenses (except for certain assets costing more than £2,000) with the flat rate.</p>\n<p>Whenever you issue an invoice, you apply VAT at the applicable rate for that product or service but you then withhold a percentage of the total gross invoice value to pay to HMRC.</p>\n<p>For example, a food manufacturer&#8217;s flat rate is 9%. On an invoice of £100 net, you&#8217;d charge your client £120 gross if this was a standard rate item. You then withhold 9% of the £120 and pay that as your VAT on the transaction.</p>\n<h4>2. Accrual accounting VAT scheme</h4>\n<p>The accrual accounting scheme is the standard VAT scheme used by almost all companies. With the accrual accounting scheme, VAT becomes due whenever:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you issue an invoice and not on when you&#8217;re paid and</li>\n<li>you receive an invoice, not on when you pay it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Cash accounting VAT scheme</h4>\n<p>The cash accounting scheme is the same as the accrual accounting scheme expect that VAT become due when your invoice have been paid rather than invoiced.</p>\n<p>This is much better for cash flow for companies which give their clients 30 or more days to make payment on their invoices. Your turnover has to be no more than £1.35m to join the scheme.</p>\n<h4>4. Annual accounting VAT scheme</h4>\n<p>With the annual accounting scheme, you estimate the level of VAT you&#8217;ll be charging during the year. You then make payments towards your agreed bill quarterly or monthly.</p>\n<p>At the end of the year, if you&#8217;ve overpaid, you get a refund from HMRC but, if you&#8217;ve underpaid, they&#8217;ll issue you with an invoice instead. The annual accounting scheme is best suited for seasonal businesses.</p>\n<h4>5. Retail and VAT margin schemes</h4>\n<p>For retailers, the retail scheme is designed to make the calculation of VAT simpler &#8211; there are three separate schemes you can choose from depending on how and what you sell and the size of your business.</p>\n<p>For sellers of second-hand goods, works of art, antiques, and collectors&#8217; items, the margin scheme is charged at 16.66% of the difference between what you paid for an item and what you sold it for.</p>\n<h4>6. Reverse charge VAT scheme</h4>\n<p>The reverse charge scheme is designed for VAT registered <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/construction/\">construction businesses</a>. It&#8217;s pretty complicated but more can be found out <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vat-domestic-reverse-charge-for-construction-services-live-today/\">here</a>.

Enter the amount you wish to work out the pre-VAT figure on and divide by 1.2.</p>\n<p>For the reduced VAT rate of 5%, enter the including-VAT figure into your calculator and divide by 1.05%.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a VAT calculator on your site?</h3>\n<p>We do have a VAT calculator on our site &#8211; please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Fonline-calculators%2Fvat-calculator\">click here to visit it</a>. This will automatically multiply or divided for you depending on the information you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions on how to use of VAT calculator</strong></p>\n<p>To use our VAT calculator, please enter a figure into the &#8220;Starting Figure&#8221; box at the top of the form. Using the box below, indicate whether the figure you have entered includes VAT.</p>\n<p>Then let our calculator know whether you are paying VAT at the standard rate or at the current hospitality and attractions rate.</p>\n<p>Then, please press the &#8220;Calculate&#8221; button.</p>\n<p>Our VAT calculator will then display the &#8220;net amount&#8221; (the figure excluding VAT), &#8220;the gross amount&#8221; (the figure including VAT) and the VAT figure (the difference between the net amount and the gross amount).</p>\n<h2>VAT and Coronavirus</h2>\n<p>In reaction to the current Coronavirus pandemic, the government temporarily a reduced VAT rate of VAT to 5% on certain supplies relating to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hospitality;</li>\n<li>Hotel and holiday accommodation; and</li>\n<li>Admissions to certain attractions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>i.e., many who were affected by forced closures and social distancing measures.

However, the 2021 Budget changed this so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>temporary reduced rate of VAT of 5% was extended until 30 September 2021; and</li>\n<li>prepare for a new rate of 12.5% from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your VAT action plan</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got three VAT action plans for you depending on your current business situation.</p>\n<h3>VAT action plan for non-registered business and companies</h3>\n<p>You must register for VAT if your annual turnover is greater than £85,000 or at the time when you expect that your annual turnover for the coming 12 months will exceed £85,000.</p>\n<p>Get in touch with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a> and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we&#8217;ll confirm that you&#8217;ve passed the threshold and help you register for VAT;</li>\n<li>if you passed the threshold a long time ago and you should have registered for VAT earlier, we&#8217;ll work out the sum you likely owe HMRC and help you resolve the issue with them; and</li>\n<li>if you have historically turned over £85,000 or less but you now think you&#8217;re likely to exceed it, let us look at your books and determine whether you&#8217;re correct. If you are, then we&#8217;ll start the process for you as your registered tax agent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>VAT action plan for companies already registered with HMRC but whose turnover has fallen</h3>\n<p>What if you are VAT registered but your turnover has fallen because of deteriorating market conditions or you&#8217;ve decided to scale back the amount of work you do? VAT deregistration is an option if your turnover falls below £85,000.</p>\n<p>The situation can be quite confusing because HMRC state that they may charge you a penalty for not deregistering for VAT within 30 days but VAT registration is voluntary for businesses turning over less than £85,000.</p>\n<p>Get in touch with us and let us examine your turnover to confirm that it has slipped under £85,000 and to confirm that it is likely to stay that way based on the average monthly revenue you&#8217;ve recently been generating. We can handle this entire process for you.</p>\n<h3>VAT action plan for companies already registered with HMRC</h3>\n<p>If you are already registered for VAT and you don&#8217;t want or need to deregister, we&#8217;ll check if you&#8217;re on the right VAT scheme.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll go through the following checklist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>do you sell second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items? </strong>If so, the retail and VAT margin scheme will almost certainly be cheaper and easier to run;</li>\n<li><strong>should you be on the flat rate VAT scheme? </strong>You don&#8217;t <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">save a huge amount of money</a> but paperwork is easy in comparison to the standard scheme &#8211; let us check if you&#8217;re eligible;</li>\n<li><strong>are you on the cash accounting VAT scheme? </strong>If you turn over less than £1.35m a year, it&#8217;s better to move from accrual accounting to cash accounting. With accrual accounting, VAT becomes due when you issue an invoice but with cash accounting, it becomes due when you’re paid. This is much better for your cash flow;</li>\n<li><strong>would you prefer to pay your VAT monthly?</strong> If so, we can contact HMRC on your behalf to request that you pay your standard VAT bills monthly rather than quarterly. Alternatively, it might be better for you to join the Annual Accounting VAT scheme; and</li>\n<li><strong>have you claimed for everything? </strong>You may have understated your input VAT over the last four years because your expenses have not been correctly recorded and allocated in your financial records. Let us look back through your accounts and make sure that you&#8217;ve claimed on every allowable and related expense. You&#8217;ll be surprised how many companies are due a refund and by the size of some of those refunds as well. We&#8217;ll work with HMRC throughout the entire process on your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get in touch with us and make sure to make sure that you&#8217;re on the VAT scheme which suits your business.</p>\n<h2>Working with VAT accountants</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black And White</a> Accounting is an established accounting practice working with businesses across the UK.

Today we have sent out Happy New (Tax) Year cards, or Thank You cards to all our clients, as more than ever, we want to make you aware how grateful we are for your business and how we are here to help and support you, more than ever before.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, the cards are on recycled card and trees have been planted to absorb the carbon created from the production and delivery of the cards.</p>\n<p>Please find below some of the key updates from us as a team.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Like any small business we are always seeking ways to learn and improve. This year, more than ever before has been fraught with challenges, but also presented key opportunities for us. There are three key updates we want to share with you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back-to-basics mentality;</li>\n<li>Team Changes; and</li>\n<li>Software Changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>1. Back To Basics</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s great to go after the shiny new stuff, but honestly if the foundations aren&#8217;t strong, then everything can come crashing down. It is for this reason that we are going back to basics.</p>\n<p>Here are our thoughts from our work on our Purpose, Vision and Value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose </strong>&#8211; We love to help people and we do that via <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">great accounting services:</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving you space to focus on what you do best;</li>\n<li>Helping you stay in love with what you do; and</li>\n<li>Being by your side through times of change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Vision </strong>&#8211; We love to help people and we do that via <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/\">great accounting services:</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving you space to focus on what you do best;</li>\n<li>Helping you stay in love with what you do; and</li>\n<li>Being by your side through times of change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Values</strong> – how we work together and with clients – we are an ELITE team:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Empathy</strong> – get to know you, we treat you as individuals, we seek to understand, not judge;</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership</strong> – being proactive, being honest, being responsible – we deliver what we say we will;</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation</strong> – we are constantly learning from CPD, experience, embracing change, feedback, building skills and knowledge, to challenge the status quo;</li>\n<li><strong>Teamwork</strong> – we partner to support each other’s success, we build trust through our actions and integrity; and</li>\n<li><strong>Excellence</strong> – our expertise steers and navigates you through the quagmire of compliance, in a timely and organised way (feeds into clarity R&amp;R of all responsibilities).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do you think? Please hold us to these and if we are not measuring up, please let us know. If we are doing a good job equally please let us know as we all like to hear feedback. We will also be doing more regular surveys so we thank you in advance for your input here as we strive to be your ELITE team.</p>\n<h2>2. Team Changes</h2>\n<p>During coronavirus for one reason or another three of our team moved on to new challenges. We are however delighted to say that we have finally found some great people to add to our team. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mehreen-joins-the-team/\">Mehreen</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sehar-checks-in/\">Sehar </a>and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/shara-joins-black-and-white/\">Shara</a> have now joined and watch this space as there will be more announcements here to follow shortly, which we are very excited by. Please welcome them to the team when you speak with them. They are very excited to join and really look forward to working with you! They will be key to taking <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White</a> to the next level.</p>\n<h2>3. Software Changes</h2>\n<p>In addition to the changes in the team, we have also done a landscape assessment of all of our workflows, processes and software and made some big investments here to ensure we do everything more efficient and effectively than ever before. You may find things we send through look a bit different, and this will probably be why. You, our clients, are at the centre of everything we do, so please share any thoughts or ideas you might have here.</p>\n<h2>Happy but not satisfied</h2>\n<p>I will sum this up by saying that we are happy with our progress as a business, but never satisfied as we can always do more. We ask that you hold us accountable to our Purpose, Vision and Values, and continue to give us your thoughts and feedback to help us improve the service we provide you with. You can always <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">email us </a>or populate one of the surveys we will be sending through to you throughout the year.</p>\n<h2>Why Black and White</h2>\n<p>Whilst we acknowledge there are still some ways we can improve, and will always seek to improve, here are just a few of the key reasons we think you should consider us as your key business partners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Community matters to us &#8211; we are very fortunate and we will always seek to help those less fortunate that we are;</li>\n<li>Fellow entrepreneurs &#8211; we have real life business experience and understand the great challenges and opportunities of being self-employed and being an entrepreneur;</li>\n<li>Payment methods &#8211; we welcome Direct Debit payment so you can spread the costs throughout the year to help your cashflow, or we can invoice you when we do the work, depending what is best for you. Either way, our Fixed Fees mean you won&#8217;t get any unexpected fees. Our fees include those accounting and tax questions as you go through the year;</li>\n<li>Free Initial Consultations &#8211; are available to potential clients to talk through any questions you have or any initial advice you might need;</li>\n<li>We want to be your One Stop Shop for all your accounting, business and tax advice. In the unlikely event we cannot help you directly, we have some great Strategic Partners, waiting in the wings to help and support you if and when you need it;</li>\n<li>We always want to show our gratitude to you.

To navigate the complexities of Self-Assessment returns and avoid late payment penalties, seeking the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">guidance of a self-assessment accountant</a> is crucial. Timely assistance can help prevent additional penalties and ensure compliance with HMRC regulations.</p>\n<h2>Late payment of corporation tax</h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">file your company tax returns</a> on time, the following penalties apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 day overdue &#8211; £100;</li>\n<li>3 months overdue &#8211; another £100;</li>\n<li>6 months overdue &#8211; HMRC will send you an estimate of what they think your corporation tax will be with an additional penalty of 10% on top; and</li>\n<li>1 Feb (one year overdue) &#8211; a further penalty of 10% of unpaid tax</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will pay 2.6% on the amount owed by you plus fines. The £100 fines shown above go up to £500 if you&#8217;re late three years in a row with your filing your returns.</p>\n<h2>Late payment of VAT</h2>\n<p>VAT works on a system of defaults.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re late in filing a return and/or you don&#8217;t settle what is owed in time, they issue you with a surcharge but this won’t cost you anything the first time around. If you&#8217;re not late again within one year, the surcharge will be dropped.</p>\n<p>However, if you are late again within the year, you’ll then pay a penalty each time based upon a percentage of the outstanding VAT owed. They may also fine you £400 for submitting a paper VAT return and 100% of understated VAT payment or overclaimed VAT refund if the error was careless or deliberate.</p>\n<p>With some VAT-registered businesses, HMRC may send out an assessment of what they think you owe if you are late in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">returning your form</a> and in paying what is owed to them. If their assessment is too low and you don&#8217;t then subsequently inform them that it&#8217;s too low, they will fine you 30% of the value given in the assessment.</p>\n<h2>Late payment of PAYE</h2>\n<p>For late payment of PAYE tax, you won&#8217;t be fined or penalised for one late submission (as long as the submission is not six months or more late).

      "content": "<p>To help UK plc cope with the unprecedented economic turmoil and start-stop shutdowns caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government has had to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds.</p>\n<p>A significant part of this cash was funnelled directly into the bank accounts of small businesses via the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Given how well known the scheme is, it might surprise you to hear that, every week, we receive a surprising number of email from experienced businesspeople whose question to us is &#8220;how do you pay back your Bounce Back loan?&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that there is such uncertainty around this subject. That&#8217;s because the Bounce Back Loan scheme was launched in such a hurry &#8211; Rishi Sunak and HM Treasury in effect ripped up many different rules books especially in the area of borrower eligibility criteria in order to get money out as fast as they could to small business owners.</p>\n<p>Recent developments have made accountants wonder whether it&#8217;s wise to advice their clients to repay Bounce Back Loans in full if they have the spare cash in their accounts. We&#8217;ll tell you why later in this article.</p>\n<p>But, to start off with, let&#8217;s look at what we know for definite about repaying Bounce Back Loans and what the options available are that are available to you.</p>\n<h2>What is the Bounce Back Loan Scheme?</h2>\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-bounce-back-loans-to-launch-today\">4th May 2020</a>, applications to borrow money from the Government&#8217;s new Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS or CBBLS) were invited by HM Treasury.</p>\n<p>Bounce Back loans were to be distributed through a nationwide network of traditional and start-up banks and financial services firms which had partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/\">British Business Bank plc</a>.</p>\n<p>After receiving criticism for the first round of Coronavirus-related loan schemes because of the requirement for directors to personally guarantee them, HM Treasury announced that all Bounce Back loans were subject to a 100% government backed guarantee protecting the banks from bad debt caused through borrower default.</p>\n<p>As all Bounce Back loans came with a government backed guarantee, no personal or director guarantees would be required by the Government or lenders from borrowers. In fact, if a limited company was to apply for a Bounce Back Loan, lenders would even consider paying the funds into a personal current account if there was no separate business bank account (although this is not seen as best practice.</p>\n<h2>What was the original Bounce Bank Loan offer?</h2>\n<p>Under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">small limited companies</a> could borrow between £2,000 and £50,000 and the cash would arrive in their bank account within a few days.</p>\n<p>There would be an annual interest rate of 2.5% (calculated daily on the amount you owe) on the loan but interest would not be applied during the first year with HM Treasury paying the first years&#8217; interest. In fact, there is no loan repayments for the first 12 months either.</p>\n<p>The original loan term was for five years after the initial interest-free period (although this can now be extended as we discuss below). Your first repayment would be in month thirteen with monthly repayments to be made thereafter.</p>\n<p>How much could you borrow? You could apply for a loan between £2,000 and £50,000 &#8211; the maximum amount was 25% of your regular annual turnover.</p>\n<p>From 10th November 2020, in addition to your original application for a Bounce Back Loan, you could also apply for a top up loan as long as the total sum of all Bounce Back loans taken out did not exceed a total amount of £50,000 or 25% of your annual turnover.</p>\n<p>Unlike with the original loan though, your first repayment on the top up would not be collected in 12 months’ time. Your top up payment holiday would end on the first anniversary of your original loan.</p>\n<p>Bounce Back loans were closed to new applications from 31 March 2021, replaced by the Recovery Loan Scheme</p>\n<h3>Can I repay my Bounce Back Loan early?</h3>\n<p>You can make early repayment in part or full of your Bounce Back Loan. Even better, unlike many commercial loans and residential mortgages, there are no early repayment charges to be paid at any time either.</p>\n<p>Indeed, quite a few of our clients have taken out a Bounce Back Loan in case they needed it, as we didn&#8217;t know what was going to happen, but are looking to repay it in full/in part before any interest becomes chargeable.</p>\n<h2>What is the Pay As You Grow scheme?</h2>\n<p>Recently, the Government has announced &#8220;Pay As You Grow&#8221; &#8211; a scheme which offers borrowers extra time and flexibility to pay back their Bounce Back Loans.</p>\n<p>This is ideal if you need more time to return to regular turnover and profitability levels and you need financial breathing room before you can start to repay the Bounce Back Loan.</p>\n<p>In addition to the first 12 months where no monthly repayments are required, borrowers may now take the option of an extra repayment holiday of an additional six months at the time when they&#8217;re due to start to repay the loan.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, they can instead ask to take the repayment holiday option of six months at any time during the remaining term of their loan.</p>\n<p>Another new Pay As Your Grow option is that borrowers can ask to reduce their monthly repayments for six months by paying interest only. You can request this facility up to three times during the remaining time left on your loan.</p>\n<p>And finally, borrowers can request that their loan term be increased from six years (including the initial 12 months during which no monthly repayments are required) to ten years keeping the same interest charge of 2.5% per annum.</p>\n<h3>How do I access Pay As You Grow?</h3>\n<p>Within three months of your first monthly repayment, your lender will contact you to ask you if you wish to take any of these options up initially.</p>\n<p>If you wish to apply to the Pay As You Grow scheme, you&#8217;ll need to wait for the bank or financial institution you used to apply for your original loan to contact you.</p>\n<h2>Why you shouldn&#8217;t repay your Bounce Back Loan in full &#8211; our thoughts</h2>\n<p>What I am about to share with you is far from certain but I am just going to pass it on anyway.</p>\n<p>According to the Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT), two thirds of the £40bn loaned through the Bounce Back Loan Scheme was lent was to genuine small businesses.</p>\n<p>The AAT <a href=\"https://www.p2pfinancenews.co.uk/2021/02/09/accounting-body-urges-treasury-to-write-off-legitimate-bounce-back-loans/\">stated</a> that there would be actually be a longer-term benefit to taxpayers by writing off all Bounce Back loans in their entirety because of the very high level of expected defaults.</p>\n<p>Last November, <a href=\"https://www.p2pfinancenews.co.uk/2020/11/25/taxpayers-could-be-left-with-a-29-5bn-bill-from-bad-debts-caused-by-defaults-in-the-governments-emergency-lending-schemes-the-office-for-budget-responsibility-obr-has-warned/\">the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)</a> expressed their belief that taxpayers would be left with a £29.5bn bill from bad debts caused problems with the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.</p>\n<p>In January 2020, the National Audit Office (NAO) <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/government-set-to-write-off-31bn-of-pandemic-loans/\">predicted</a> that £31bn of government loans handed out during the pandemic will have to be written off.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all gone a bit quiet on the subject of expected defaults and what should be done about it except for the announcement of the Pay As You Grow scheme a week or two after the NAO&#8217;s predictions.</p>\n<p>It seems like the Government is not yet ready to the logic of writing off the loans. Indeed, whenever the writing off of loans is discussed, the usual moral hazard arguments come up.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there&#8217;s no guarantee that they will accept their recommendations.</p>\n<h3>Historic precedent (sort of)</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m no historian but there exists a concept called a <a href=\"https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/news/debt-jubilee.html\">Debt Jubilee</a>. In a debt jubilee, a country cancels the debt of the people and organisations which owe money to it. The tradition first appeared in ancient Babylonia and Syria and the number of occurrences of debt jubilee since then have been few and far between.</p>\n<p>But what if Rishi Sunak called a Debt Jubilee for the businesses which took advantage of this scheme? And, until a jubilee is either officially confirmed or denied, would repaying your Bounce Back loan make sense, even if you could afford to clear it in full now from cash flow?</p>\n<h3>Rationale for not paying the Bounce Bank Loan in full yet</h3>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s get the obvious out of the way.</p>\n<p>If your company has been back to regular levels of turnover and profitability for a while and you can afford to pay back your loan, what do you think the chances of the Government voluntarily handing back you back the money you&#8217;ve repaid if they call a jubilee?</p>\n<h4>Where&#8217;s the advantage in paying it back?</h4>\n<p>Second, even if they don&#8217;t, where is the sense in paying it back? What advantage will it deliver you?</p>\n<p>Bounce Back loans were made to limited companies (no <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">sole trader</a> or self employed person could take advantage of it even if they wanted it to).</p>\n<p>As directors of incorporated small businesses, we&#8217;re used to being required to take out personal guarantees on company debt.</p>\n<p>But the Government made it a condition of lending that no directors had to sign personal guarantees for Coronavirus Business Interruption loans.</p>\n<p>Even if your limited company goes under, you won&#8217;t be personally liable to repay the Bounce Back loan (except for cases of wrongful or illegal trading but, even then, that&#8217;s not clear).</p>\n<p>There may be another wave or multiple waves of COVID-19 in the future. After the mistakes made with the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, it&#8217;s unlikely to offered again in this form.</p>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t it make more sense to keep the money in your bank account in case there is another emergency because you might really need it then?</p>\n<p>Having the loan will impact the position of your Balance Sheet and therefore could impact your borrowing capability, but would you be able to get better terms on the open market if you needed further borrowings?</p>\n<h4>Has the pandemic presented you with an opportunity?</h4>\n<p>Third, the pandemic has been trying on us all.</p>\n<p>The Government has given us several lots of cash help during the crisis in addition to the furlough and other schemes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the business interruption payment in the form of grants based upon our premise&#8217;s rateable value; and</li>\n<li>the Bounce Back Loan scheme (or Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) for larger companies).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some businesses though, turnover is near normal again and profitability is creeping up. The economy is expected to recover to its previous size within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In all my time as an accountant, one of the hardest challenges many of my clients have had is to find the money they need to grow their business &#8211; to upgrade their website, to invest in plant and machinery, to hire new staff, and so on.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/loan-calculator/\">borrow money</a> normally, it&#8217;s your house on the line because of the requirement to sign a director&#8217;s guarantee as we mentioned above.</p>\n<p>And business is so competitive these days that it&#8217;s really difficult to increase trade to the levels required to create the free cash flow required to pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>expansion or investment in the first place; and/or</li>\n<li>the often associated higher ongoing fixed costs as a result of that expansion and investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is the Bounce Back loan the funding you&#8217;ve actually been waiting for all these years? Just a thought&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Wrongful use of a Bounce Back Loan</h2>\n<p>One area where we have big concerns this year is where the Bounce Back Loan has been used for the wrong purposes.</p>\n<p>For example, if your business has received a Bounce Back Loan and you have ‘borrowed it’ for your personal use then you could legally have to pay back what you have borrowed. This could put your personal assets at risk if you have spent the money. There were some high profile examples of Directors going out and buying sports cars with their loans.</p>\n<p>If you compound this with a business which has falling profits, it could create a lot of overdrawn directors loan accounts, which could cause s455 charges at 32.5% of the overdrawn amount, which will further hurt cashflow (even through it is a &#8216;bond&#8217; which HMRC repay as soon as the overdraft is repaid).</p>\n<p>This is why some have called it the &#8216;bouncing bomb&#8217;.</p>\n<h2>Bounce Back Loan repayments QuickFAQ</h2>\n<h3>Where can I see a list of the lenders who took part in the Bounce Back loan scheme?</h3>\n<p>All banks and financial services which partook in the Bounce Back Loan Scheme are listed on the <a href=\"https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/\">website</a> of the British Business Bank plc.</p>\n<h3>What happens if you don&#8217;t pay back a Bounce Back Loan?</h3>\n<p>Probably nothing. Your personal assets are not at risk and, while your company credit score may be affected, not paying it back will not affect your personal credit score. However some banks have indicated that the presence of a Bounce Back loan default on a credit score would influence their decision to lend further money to a company. This is however not entirely certain at this point.</p>\n<h3>Do you have to pay back a Bounce Back Loan?</h3>\n<p>You legally have to repay your Bounce Back loan but exactly how the government, HMRC, or banks will penalise you for not repaying the loan is unclear. As best practice we would recommend it, but as outlined above, there are some interesting factors which are still uncertain here.</p>\n<h3>Will a Bounce Back Loan be written off if I don&#8217;t pay it back?</h3>\n<p>In all likelihood, your company&#8217;s Bounce Back loan will be written off as all of your company&#8217;s other debts. We are currently unaware of any &#8220;test cases&#8221; to prove this however as this is all still new and the relaxing of the wrongful trading rules and others has meant these haven&#8217;t come to pass yet.</p>\n<h3>Liquidating with a Bounce Back Loan &#8211; is it possible?</h3>\n<p>To the best of our understanding, the Bounce Back loan will be classed as an &#8220;unsecured debt&#8221; by insolvency practitioners. Under the rules of the Bounce Back Loan scheme, banks and financial institutions were not allowed to have ‘first lien’ or secured charge linked to the loan so your loan provider will have to join the queue of creditors. It is still a genuine creditor and if the funds are there they will be paid, but it won&#8217;t impact the capital ratios of the banks as it is 100% guaranteed by the Government so how willing will they be to pursue the loans?</p>\n<h3>What about personal liability for bounce back loans?</h3>\n<p>It certainly doesn&#8217;t look like there is any although we would be interested to see how it&#8217;s treated in the case of wrongful or unlawful trading. Again, there are no case studies which can provide guidance to us at this moment. We will of course update you as we hear more.</p>\n<h2>Bounce Back Loan Scheme Black and White Action Plan</h2>\n<p>Before you know whether there is going to be a debt jubilee and before you decide whether to pay your Bounce Back Loan back in full if you have the cash or whether to apply for the Pay As You Grow scheme, get in touch with the team at <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s plan a bespoke pandemic Bounce Back roadmap for your company &#8211; let&#8217;s start by asking where do you want to be in 5 years&#8217; time from now?</p>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">contact us</a>, we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask you where you want to be in 2026 &#8211; tell us your business goals for the next five years</li>\n<li>Examine your cash position &#8211; how are you financially right now?</li>\n<li>Look at what&#8217;s due to come in and leave your bank account &#8211; are you in a stronger or weaker position than your cash position suggests?</li>\n<li>Find out where the market&#8217;s going &#8211; what do you think the important trends affecting your sector will be in the next few years?</li>\n<li>Level up against your competition &#8211; where do you need to catch up to your competitors?</li>\n<li>Figure out what&#8217;s affordable &#8211; we&#8217;ll take all that information and come up with most affordable and less risky plan to help you achieve your personal and professional financial goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also bring in one of our Strategic Partners to help the conversation.</p>\n<h2>Contact the Black and White Accounting Team</h2>\n<p>Black and White Accounting represents clients across the UK (and more widely).

      "content": "<p>&#8230;why doesn&#8217;t the tax year start on the 1st January? Why the 6th April? Well you wouldn&#8217;t be the first to ask us. So we thought we&#8217;d fill you in&#8230;</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>What date would you pick? It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a ring to the 6th April, is there? As much as I love tax, I must confess to a &#8220;normal&#8221; human there it isn&#8217;t the most intuitive topic to follow. In fact, we will have to take you on history lesson to explain this further.</p>\n<h2>Tax Year Start</h2>\n<p>Our tax year dates originate from when people in England paid their landlords rent on the &#8216;quarter days&#8217;, i.e., 25 March, 24 June, 29 September, and 25 December. The first in the year, 25 March, came to be recognised as the start of the financial year, and originally kicked off the whole annual calendar.</p>\n<p>Now in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered a change from the Julian calendar (named after Julius Caesar) to the Gregorian calendar (you can probably guess where that name came from). The Gregorian calendar noted it actually only takes 365.2422&#8230; days for the Earth to orbit the Sun, instead of the 365.25&#8230; days (these small differences make all the difference in the world, literally!) that the Julian calendar followed. While the new Gregorian calendar was almost immediately followed by nations under Catholic control, England, as a Protestant country at the time, did not adopt the calendar immediately. In fact, it took us 170 years to follow suit.</p>\n<p>These small differences quickly added up at a time when it needed to be in-synch with its trading partners thanks to it&#8217;s growing empire. In order to play catch-up, in 1751, the New Year&#8217;s Day became 1 January, meaning the English calendar for that year was just 282 days (from 25 March to 31 December). Then to allow for the extra 11 days, in 1752 the English calendar jumped from 2 September to 14 September overnight. Funnily enough the authorities still expected a full years&#8217; business rates to be paid in both years, which didn&#8217;t prove popular. As compensation for this, 11 days were added to the tax year, taking it from 25th March to 5th April each year.</p>\n<p>In 1800 this was changed again, in recognition of a skipped leap year, making it 6th April, that we still know and use today (can&#8217;t honestly say love).</p>\n<h2>Harmonisation and further technology to come?</h2>\n<p>With all things international and harmonisation, the phrase herding cats comes to mind. Whilst there has been significant progress on the converging of international accounting standards (don&#8217;t worry, I will spare you the detail, at least for now), there has been much less progress on the tax side. Many countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Germany and even British dependencies like Jersey, use the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-calendar/\">calendar year as their tax year</a>. However, it doesn&#8217;t look like the UK will follow suit and with Brexit, this would perhaps prove even less likely to happen, creating more complexity for those trading across borders, with non-aligned tax jurisdictions when we should indeed be doing the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>Making Tax Digital (MTD), is an attempt to embrace technology and propel to UK to the front of the digitalisation wave (or as a cynic would say HMRC will get more tax, from more people, more often). However, with the delays already confirmed in the roll-out here, who knows when this will come. The number of key tax dates don&#8217;t look like they will abate either. There are three different quarters for VAT (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct, Feb/May/Aug/Nov and Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec), with three different deadlines and as the quarterly reporting under expands to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax</a>, buy-to-let landlords and housebuilders renting out rooms, this will increase further (quarters ending 5 July, October, January, and April). That&#8217;s before we think about <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a> (there are currently 365 possible days in the year when there are requirements for filing for Companies) when rather than one tax return and one payment date, there will be four of these each year.</p>\n<p>Maybe in the same spirit of simplification we embraced with decimalisation on 15 February 1971, we should take a step back and simplify the tax dates through the year. This could be a real opportunity which would help all businesses across the UK. For whatever reason all the tax simplification projects in recent decades have done the opposite with the tax legislation (as well as tax cases) growing by the day.</p>\n<p>All these inconsistencies are confusing and increase probability of errors taking place. Whilst HMRC might benefit from more interest and penalties, it does not help businesses so is not in the interests of UK Plc overall.</p>\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<p>OK we have to confess, we are accountants, we are book keepers, we do like tax and maybe, sometimes we are a little geeky.

      "content": "<p>Established in 2015 through the merger of the Special Investigations Unit and the Criminal Investigations Unit, the Fraud Investigation Service (FIS) is the elite group within HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) investigating cases of suspected serious tax evasion, tax fraud, and aggressive tax avoidance.</p>\n<p>For decades, Governments of all colours have been concerned with closing down and seizing the assets of criminal gangs and recovering tax revenues denied to them through fraud. HMRC have been similarly concerned with closing the tax gap &#8211; the difference between what they think they should be collecting in tax and what they actually end up collecting.</p>\n<p>The HMRC FIS was born as a result.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It’s a small but important part of the HMRC Enforcement and Compliance Team which has 26,000 staff working for it in 120 locations in the UK and in 30 countries around the world.</p>\n<p>Its spin-off and specialist FIS team are considered as a success by many because of the billions of pounds extra raised each year as a result of their investigations.</p>\n<p>If your financial and tax affairs are or may be under the scrutiny of the FIS team, what do you need to know and what exactly are you up against?</p>\n<p>Are you currently being investigated or do you suspect you might be investigated? Call Black &amp; White Accounting in strict confidence for advice and support &#8211; our freephone number is 0800 140 464 or you can <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">email us by clicking here</a>.</p>\n<h2>The four different departments within the HMRC FIS</h2>\n<h3>FIS Prosecutions team</h3>\n<p>HMRC&#8217;s tax investigations and prosecutions team consists of 600 agents and their job is to target taxpayers suspected of early stage serious tax evasion.</p>\n<p>Nearly every prosecution pursued by this team is civil and not criminal &#8211; in 2018, the number of individuals prosecuted mostly under the common law charge of &#8220;cheat&#8221; reached 1,000.</p>\n<p>In a majority of cases, the investigators secured a conviction and a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/warning-money-laundering/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"213\">Money Laundering</a> Regulations confiscation order against the offenders they prosecuted.</p>\n<p>The HMRC&#8217;s prosecutions team also focuses on VAT fraud.</p>\n<p>This tax is actually one of the hardest types of tax to evade or avoid because it&#8217;s a transaction-based tax and it needs to be accounted for on every sale you make.</p>\n<p>HMRC is able to compare the financial records of the business they have suspicions about against the records of companies in the same sector to determine whether underreporting and underpayment may be taking place.</p>\n<h3>Investigations into UK tax matters</h3>\n<p>Taxpayers under investigation from the Bootle branch of FIS are likely to be suspected of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/hmrc-coronavirus-fraud/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"238\">serious fraud</a> tax where there is no known overseas or offshore bank accounts or assets involved.</p>\n<p>This department has responsibility for UK-based tax investigations and its officers primarily deal with suspected serious domestic fraud cases.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, most tax fraud does not involve individuals and companies with offshore assets, property, or cash.</p>\n<h3>Investigation into overseas and offshore tax matters</h3>\n<p>On that subject though, a few years ago, HMRC offered a sort of amnesty to people with offshore assets, property, or cash through their now-closed &#8220;Requirement to Correct&#8221; campaign.</p>\n<p>Its purpose was to encourage “those with undeclared offshore tax liabilities (relating to Income Tax, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Capital Gains Tax or Inheritance Tax</a> for the relevant periods) to disclose those to HMRC on or before 30 September 2018.”</p>\n<p>For decades, international financial transparency was poor and tax-raising bodies like HMRC had to cajole tax evaders and avoiders using campaigns like these.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s different now with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/automatic-exchange-of-information-introduction\">Automatic Exchange of Information</a> via the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/news/hmrc-cracks-british-expats-tax-haul-trebles-risk/\">Common Reporting Standard</a> (CRS).</p>\n<p>The CRS is a shared file format used by tax authorities and financial institutions to send each other information about citizens and businesses. Over 130 countries are now party to the standard.</p>\n<p>If you receive correspondence from FIS from a BX postcode, it’s likely that they believe that you have understated or hidden earnings from abroad.</p>\n<h3>What is the FIS task force?</h3>\n<p>HMRC&#8217;s task force&#8217;s job is to arrive unannounced at business premises to investigate whether various different taxes have been correctly reported and paid from VAT to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/minimum-wage/\">National Minimum Wages</a> and from Income Tax to Corporation Tax.</p>\n<p>Their investigations are extensive and can take days or weeks to complete. If this happens to you, you should ask your accountant to be in attendance while the Task Force is at your business premises.</p>\n<h2>What are the three types of HMRC fraud investigation?</h2>\n<p>There are three types of investigation which HMRC&#8217;s FIS team undertake:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full </strong>&#8211; where HMRC believes there is significant risk of fraud, they’ll undertake a full and wide-ranging investigation of the personal and corporate financial records of company directors and owners to look for evidence and details of wrongdoing;</li>\n<li><strong>Aspect </strong>&#8211; an “aspect” tax investigation focuses on a particular areas of concern within an individual or company&#8217;s financial and tax records; and</li>\n<li><strong>Random </strong>&#8211; as the name suggests, a random tax investigation is carried out on a business for no particular reason although anecdotal evidence suggests that cash-based businesses and companies sending &amp; receiving international VAT invoices are more likely to be targeted than others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is the Code of Practice 8 (COPD8) and the Code of Practice 9 (COPD9)?</h2>\n<p>Tax fraud cases brought under Code of Practice 8 (COPD8) differ from tax fraud cases brought under Code of Practice 9 (COPD9)</p>\n<p>Cases brought under Code of Practice 8 (COPD8) are when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a suspicion than tax fraud or tax avoidance could have taken place;</li>\n<li>They do not suspect that the tax fraud or tax avoidance was carried out deliberately; and</li>\n<li>They&#8217;re seeking to recover a large amount of tax they believe you should have paid them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under Code of Practice 8 (COPD8), there is no guaranteed protection for you from a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Cases brought under Code of Practice 9 (COPD9) are different in that, although it still concerns tax fraud, you will be offered something called a Contractual Disclosure Facility (CDF).</p>\n<p>With a Contractual Disclosure Facility, the FIS gives you 60 days to disclose what tax should have been paid.</p>\n<p>If you are offered the Contractual Disclosure Facility by the officers dealing with the tax investigation/enquiry into your affairs, you will be expected to make a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full admission of deliberate tax avoidance or tax evasion;</li>\n<li>Full and extensive disclosure of all irregularities, errors, and omissions; and</li>\n<li>Promise to fully cooperate with HMRC’s enquiries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this offer may sound attractive at first glance, we strongly advice you take professional advice because accepting an officer&#8217;s invitation to cooperate under COPD9 is, in and of itself, an admission of guilt. This admission of guilt usually means that the penalties you incur for your actions will be significantly higher once the enquiry has ended and a verdict has been reached.</p>\n<p>You are under no obligation to accept FIS investigators&#8217; offers of either a COPD8 or a COPD9.</p>\n<h2>FIS Quick FAQ</h2>\n<h3>How long does it take for HMRC to investigate fraud?</h3>\n<p>Most investigations last for several months. To speed up the process, FIS officers will ask that you respond to any letter sent from them to you in the space of 30 days to help them bring their investigation to a close as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>How do I know if HMRC are investigating me?</h3>\n<p>HMRC do not notify you necessarily if they begin to look into your tax affairs however, if they make the investigation formal, they will send you a letter asking for more information normally on a restricted area of tax they are interested in finding out more about. It is not uncommon for an investigation to be widened later on.</p>\n<h3>How does HMRC calculate tax penalties for fraud?</h3>\n<p>There are set and fixed penalties if you, for example, miss a filing or a payment deadline. Financial penalties issued as a result of a tax investigation are normally percentages or multiples of the tax owed with interest applied to those amounts for the duration of time they&#8217;ve been unpaid.</p>\n<h3>How do I report fraud to HMRC?</h3>\n<p>HMRC prefers fraud to be reported in the first instance using one of its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/report-fraud-to-hmrc\">online forms</a>.</p>\n<h2>Be represented during a fraud investigation</h2>\n<p>The HMRC FIS team have a statutory duty to investigate fraud and serious tax evasion. As much as someone may feel that it is unjust singling them out for investigation, please remember that they are doing their job and they only want to find the guilty.</p>\n<p>You will need professional representation if you&#8217;re being investigated by the FIS &#8211; specifically a solicitor and an accountant. Many prosecutions can be avoided if a taxpayer assembles the right team to defend them.</p>\n<p>To find out more, please get in touch with us today, by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contacting Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants</a>, populating the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on our freephone number 0800 140 464 for confidential advice.</p>\n",

Claim against all allowable tax deductible business expenses possible</h3>\n<p>Every tax deductible business expenses included on your CT600 return reduces what you need to pay HMRC. These are legitimate business expenses you&#8217;ve incurred in the course of providing your clients with the goods and services you provide and you&#8217;re entitled to claim back on them.</p>\n<p>Be careful however as there no hard-and-fast rules on which expenses you can and cannot claim so you should always seek professional advice from an accountant on what you can use to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">lessen your corporation tax</a> liability. Not only is there tax legislation but there is tax cases to consider too.</p>\n<p>To qualify as allowable expenditure, each item or service your business purchases has to comply with the &#8220;wholly and exclusively rule&#8221; otherwise it&#8217;s unlikely that HMRC will allow it.</p>\n<p>Tax is a complicated subject so your accountant will apply HMRC’s &#8220;wholly and exclusively rule&#8221; when considering each item of potentially allowable expenditure to assess whether you&#8217;re actually able to claim for it legitimately.</p>\n<h3>2. Claim on your research and development costs (R&amp;D tax credits)</h3>\n<p>For over 20 years now, the government have encourages business to invest in R&amp;D. So much so that <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">you can claim for R&amp;D tax credits</a> which will roughly reduce your corporation tax bill by 25% of the cost of the project (even more if you lost money during that financial year), which can literally be a game-charger for your business.</p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s best to make R&amp;D tax claims as soon as possible, you do actually have two years from the end of your accounting period to make a claim if it&#8217;s better for you.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White</a> note </strong>– get in touch with us and let’s discover whether you had a valid claim for R&amp;D tax credits which you did not know about at the time. We can make R&amp;D tax claims for your previous two accounting periods on your behalf.</p>\n<h3>3. Do you make money from patents?</h3>\n<p>If your company profits from the exploitation of…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patented inventions;</li>\n<li>Patents you own or have exclusively license in; and/or</li>\n<li>Work your company did which led to the creation of a patented invention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…you can use the Patent Box to lower the amount of corporation tax you pay on those profits from 19% to 10%.</p>\n<h3>4. Claim the capital allowance on property transactions</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">claim capital allowance for expenditure</a> on commercial buildings, fixtures, and chattels owned by your company. Depending on your current situation, you may be entitled to one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>enterprise zone allowances;</li>\n<li>structure and buildings allowances;</li>\n<li>fit-out allowances for leased commercial properties; and</li>\n<li>capital allowances on a property sale or purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Black and White note</em></strong> &#8211; this is a complicated area for which we recommend you seek professional advice.</p>\n<h3>5. Offer a share scheme to your staff</h3>\n<p>Corporation tax charged against your company&#8217;s profits may be reduced if your offer a share scheme to your employees.</p>\n<p>In addition to saving money, they&#8217;re very effective for motivating staff and gaining their longer-term loyalty.</p>\n<p>Ask us about Share Incentive Plans, Save As You Earn (SAYE), Company Share Option Plans, and Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs).</p>\n<h3>6. Use as much of your Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) as possible to bring down your tax bill</h3>\n<p>Each year, every company can use its Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) to invest in plant and machinery and costs related to them.</p>\n<p>Capital allowance claims can also be made against expenditure on the following items and activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘know-how’ (intellectual property about industrial techniques);</li>\n<li>dredging;</li>\n<li>mineral extraction;</li>\n<li>patents;</li>\n<li>renovating business premises in disadvantaged areas of the UK;</li>\n<li>research and development; and</li>\n<li>structure and buildings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can deduct the full value of these items/activities and the associated costs from your profit to lessen your tax bill.</p>\n<p>On 1 January 2019, AIA was increased to £1 million but AIA was then reduced in value to £200,000 in January 2021.</p>\n<p>One of the bits of good news from the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/spring-budget-q1-newsletter/\">Spring Budget</a> was the so called Super-Deduction. Whilst we are awaiting further details here, there will be further <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">tax allowances</a> here from April 2021 on certain classes of assets where the company can reduce their company tax by around 25p for every pound invested in qualifying new equipment (similar to the R&amp;D tax credit regime mentioned here).</p>\n<h3>7. Claim any work from home allowance you&#8217;re entitled to</h3>\n<p>You can benefit from further corporation tax relief by working from home.</p>\n<p>You can allocate a proportion of the business-related expenses you incur by working from home to you company &#8211; for example, telephone calls, insurance, internet access, and more.</p>\n<h3>8. File and pay your tax bill on time&#8230;</h3>\n<p>There are a series of fines and penalties for late filing and payment of Corporation Tax which your company will avoid completely if you hit HMRC&#8217;s deadlines.</p>\n<h3>9. &#8230;better still, pay ahead of time</h3>\n<p>Very few companies want to pay HMRC but early payment and being this tax efficient has its benefits.</p>\n<p>If you make early payment of your corporation tax (six months and 13 days after the start of your accounting period), HMRC will pay you interest of 0.5%. Every little helps (sorry)</p>\n<h3>10. Use your personal tax allowance effectively</h3>\n<p>Everyone in the UK earning under £100,000 has an annual personal tax allowance of £12,500.</p>\n<p>Many limited company directors pay themselves mainly in dividends but this is often not the most efficient way to do so.</p>\n<p>If you pay yourself a salary up to your personal limit, you won&#8217;t pay any income tax but you and your company will have to pay some <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> (NI). Or you can pay yourself up to the primary NI threshold and you will pay no <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax</a> and neither you nor your company will pay NI.</p>\n<p>Either way, the amount you pay yourself as a salary will provide tax relief to your limited company because salary paid via the PAYE system is a tax deductible expense.</p>\n<h3>11. Make pension contributions</h3>\n<p>Likewise, pensions are also tax deductible expenses for limited companies but this is a more complicated area on which you should take professional advice. We work with some great strategic partners who would love to help you further with this.</p>\n<h3>12. Creative industry relief scheme</h3>\n<p>If your company is in the creative industry and more specifically involved in producing or developing animated television, children’s television, films, high-end television, museum or gallery exhibitions, orchestral concerts, theatrical productions, or video games, there are various tax reliefs available which permit you a higher level of allowable annual capital expenditure – a kind of special AIA scheme for creative companies.</p>\n<p>Incentives are also available for companies involved in the decision making process in these productions and/or if your company directly negotiates, contracts and pays for rights, goods, and services for these productions.</p>\n<h3>13. Business mileage tax reliefs</h3>\n<p>If your staff use their personal car for business purposes, they can claim mileage rate expenses from your limited company &#8211; this is one of the most popular ways to lower company tax bills.</p>\n<p>For the first 10,000 miles you travel in an accounting year, your employees can claim 45p per mile. For travel over 10,000 miles, the amount they can claim is 25p per mile.</p>\n<p>There are also similar allowances for travel and subsistence which you should consider.</p>\n<h3>14. Tax free staff party or parties</h3>\n<p>One popular way to reduce your tax bill is to pay for an annual <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/xmas-2020/\">staff party</a> &#8211; or parties throughout the year.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure that you keep your annual spending per head to no than £150 per year otherwise HMRC will consider as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/its-that-time-of-the-year-again-benefits-in-kind-p11d/\">benefit in kind</a>&#8221; and each employee’s share of the costs of the parties will be considered by the taxman as part of their pay packets.</p>\n<p>Spending more than £150 a head means that you and your employee will have to pay tax on the party or parties you hold for them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White note </strong>&#8211; a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">benefit in kind is non-cash benefit which small business owners can provide to their employees</a> but whose monetary value must be reflected in an employee’s wages. Its inclusion in employee wages means that it is taxable.</em></p>\n<h3>15. Tax free parties and treats for yourself</h3>\n<p>&#8220;Trivial benefits&#8221; are tax-saving perks which you can reward your directors and employees with instead of extra pay with without the monetary value of those rewards being subject to tax or NI.</p>\n<p>No gift can cost more than £50 including VAT and the total value of gifts awarded to directors under the scheme cannot exceed £300 per year.</p>\n<p>All gifts, if wholly and exclusively are treated as expenses and therefore qualify for corporation tax relief.</p>\n<h3>16. Use a company mobile phone</h3>\n<p>With more of us working from home than ever before (even before Coronavirus), many small business owners are giving their staff company mobile phones to make and receive calls. Line rental and call charges incurred by your use and your staff&#8217;s use of mobile phones is a legitimate business expense you can claim against as long as the phone remains the property of your limited company at all times.</p>\n<h3>17. Claim subscriptions and training costs against your tax bill</h3>\n<p>Any training you purchase for yourself or your staff and any professional subscriptions to trade bodies are claimable providing an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"140\">opportunity for further tax</a> relief for your limited company.</p>\n<h3>18. Claim tax relief for previous annual losses</h3>\n<p>One of the most commons ways to reduce your corporation tax bill is to claim back all available loss reliefs.</p>\n<p>You can either carry back a loss to a previous year or you can carry them forward to reduce future tax liabilities. There will also be a temporary improvement in these rules, as announced in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/spring-budget-q1-newsletter/\">Spring Budget</a>.</p>\n<h2>How to reduce your corporation tax Quick FAQ</h2>\n<h3>What is corporation tax?</h3>\n<p>Corporation tax is a tax on company profits. Who has to pay corporation tax? Every private and public limited company.</p>\n<p>The due date for payment is nine months and one day after the end of your accounting period and the due date for the filing of your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">corporation tax returns</a> is 12 months after the end of the accounting period. For example, if your accounting period ends on 31st December, you must pay your tax by the following 1st October and file your corporation tax return by the following 31st December.</p>\n<h3>Is trying to reduce your corporation tax legal?</h3>\n<p>Yes. All limited companies are legally entitled to tax relief on each allowable business expense they&#8217;ve incurred in the course of their business.</p>\n<h3>Do dividends reduce corporation tax?</h3>\n<p>No &#8211; dividends are redistributions of cash from a company to its shareholder after corporation tax has been deducted.</p>\n<p>There are no tax reliefs related to the payment of dividends</p>\n<h3>What does lower corporation tax mean?</h3>\n<p>It means that you have more money to invest in your business now and in the future.</p>\n<p>The money you save you might keep in the bank for a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">healthier cash flow</a> or you might want to employ extra staff or purchase new plant and machinery to give your business a competitive advantage.</p>\n<h2>Keep more of what you earn &#8211; use every way to reduce corporation tax relief available to you</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll use our experience and knowledge of the tax system to legitimately reduce the amount of corporation tax your business pays.</p>\n<p>Black and White helps hundreds of small business owners and corporate clients in the South of England and across the UK to reduce their corporation tax bill through the efficient and accurate use of each available tax relief.

      "content": "<p>We appreciate 2021 has been another challenging year as we have been putting one foot in front of the other, so putting money aside or looking to reduce your tax probably couldn&#8217;t have been further from your mind. However, as the 5th April 2022 approaches, we don&#8217;t want you to miss out on the relevant allowances and reliefs to reduce your tax as part of your financial planning.</p>\n<p>We therefore include below our top ten tips for you to consider to reduce the amount of tax you will end up paying in the 2021/22 tax year, if you are able to.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Use your ISA Allowance for 2021/22</h2>\n<p>The tax-free ISA allowance is £20,000. Invest before the tax year has ended as the allowance does not rollover into the next tax year.</p>\n<h2>2. Increase your children’s savings</h2>\n<p>Junior ISAs for children provide a tax-free ISA allowance of £9,000 and can be a mix of cash and shares.</p>\n<h2>3. Top up your pension</h2>\n<p>Using your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">pension allowance</a> can reduce the amount of earnings you get taxed on. You can put a maximum of £40,000 per tax year into your pension (as long as this does not exceed your relevant earnings). If you have not used your allowance this can be carried forward for up to 3 years. SEIS/EIS/VCT investments should also be considered to potentially <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">reduce your income tax</a>, as well as other taxes.</p>\n<h2>4. Use your Capital Allowance</h2>\n<p>If <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">you need to buy a capital asset you can use your capital allowance</a> as a tax efficient means of doing so. Annual Investment Allowances (AIAs) are an example of a capital allowance and if an asset qualifies under the AIAs, you can deduct the full value of the item from your profits in the year in which you invest.</p>\n<h2>5. Make Charitable Donations</h2>\n<p>Tax relief on donations can be received through Gift Aid or Payroll Giving, which comes direct from your wages.</p>\n<h2>6. Take Company Dividends</h2>\n<p>To maximise your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax allowance</a>, your company can issue dividends to a maximum of £2,000 free of income tax. Your company will need to pay these before the 5th April 2022 to ensure they are included in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your self-assessment tax return</a> for 2021/22. Dividends above this are taxable at 7.5% (basic rate taxpayers), 32.5% (higher rate taxpayers) and 38.1% (additional rate taxpayers). Don&#8217;t forget, for 2022/23 these will be increasing, so you might want to take more in the current tax year as a result.</p>\n<p>We have assumed that you already have a PAYE scheme in place, where you don’t already use up your personal allowance with other earnings. However, where you don&#8217;t this might be something that is worth considering as part of your planning.</p>\n<p>For tailored advice on optimising your personal tax allowance through company dividends and ensuring proper inclusion in your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">self-assessment tax returns</a>, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">consulting with a self-assessment accountant</a> is advisable.</p>\n<h2>7. Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h2>\n<p>You can make £12,300 in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">capital gains this tax year</a> before you pay tax, known as the ‘annual exemption’. If you have assets to sell or shares to dispose of , think about the timing of this. Maybe you need to consider spreading this over two tax years? You may also want to look at reinvesting the gains in order to delay any tax due. Remember, now you need to report and pay the tax on the sale of a residential property within 60 days of disposal. Also cryptocurrency gains largely fall under CGT so you might want to consider a disposal of these too within the annual exemption.</p>\n<h2>8. Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) tax relief</h2>\n<p>If your business is involved in the advancement of science and technology, or has project(s) or activit(ies) that help resolve scientific or technological uncertainties, you may be able to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">claim R&amp;D tax credits</a>. This comes as an additional 130% deduction (in addition to the original claimed cost), or claim cash back at 14.5%, where losses are being made. This can help accelerate the growth of your business, give you much needed cashflow, or simply <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">reduce/wipe out any corporation tax due</a>. This is applied for by a report for inclusion in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">company tax return</a>, which you can do for the current and the previous years, if you haven&#8217;t already. Later this year we are expecting to see a review of this regime, with it potentially being increased to include advancements in mathematics too, so watch this space.</p>\n<h2>9. Limit Inheritance Tax (IHT)</h2>\n<p>You can give up to £3,000 per annum worth of gifts each tax year, which will not be included in the value of your estate, known as the ‘annual exemption’, like <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">Capital Gains Tax</a>. Each tax year, you can also give away:<br />\na. wedding or civil ceremony gifts of up to £1,000 per person (£2,500 for a grandchild or great-grandchild, £5,000 for a child);<br />\nb. normal gifts out of your income, for example Christmas or birthday presents – as long as you can maintain your standard of living after making the gift;<br />\nc. payments to help with another person’s living costs, such as an elderly relative or a child under 18; and/or<br />\nd. gifts to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/charity-accounting-services/\">charities</a> and political parties.</p>\n<h2>10. File your tax return quickly</h2>\n<p>Complete your tax return soon after the 5th April 2022 and know what tax you need to pay and any possible refund (especially for those who pay CIS). To help you do this, keep records up to date as much as you can.</p>\n<h2>Expert tax advice in simple Black and White</h2>\n<p>Whilst we appreciate this topic is the furthest from the minds of most people as we live day-to-day in the current world, we don&#8217;t want you to forget about the allowances and reliefs available to you, resulting in you paying more tax than you need to.</p>\n<p>If you want to talk about any of these more, we&#8217;d love to speak with you further, so please <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact/\">contact Black and White Accounting today</a>, populate the “Got a Question” form on the right, or call us on 0800 140 4644.

Claim against all allowable tax deductible business expenses possible</h3>\n<p>Every <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/beware-nursery-fees-not-tax-deductible-business-expense/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"223\">tax deductible business expenses</a> included on your CT600 return reduces what you need to pay HMRC. These are legitimate business expenses you&#8217;ve incurred in the course of providing your clients with the goods and services you provide and you&#8217;re entitled to claim back on them.</p>\n<p>Be careful however as there no hard-and-fast rules on which expenses you can and cannot claim so you should always seek professional advice from an accountant on what you can use to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">lessen your corporation tax liability</a>. Not only is there tax legislation but there is tax cases to consider too.</p>\n<p>To qualify as allowable expenditure, each item or service your business purchases has to comply with the &#8220;wholly and exclusively rule&#8221; otherwise it&#8217;s unlikely that HMRC will allow it.</p>\n<p>Tax is a complicated subject so your accountant will apply HMRC’s &#8220;wholly and exclusively rule&#8221; when considering each item of potentially allowable expenditure to assess whether you&#8217;re actually able to claim for it legitimately.</p>\n<h3>2. Claim on your research and development costs (R&amp;D tax credits)</h3>\n<p>For over 20 years now, the government have encourages business to invest in R&amp;D. So much so that you can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">claim for R&amp;D tax credits</a> which will roughly reduce your corporation tax bill by 25% of the cost of the project (even more if you lost money during that financial year), which can literally be a game-charger for your business.</p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s best to make R&amp;D tax claims as soon as possible, you do actually have two years from the end of your accounting period to make a claim if it&#8217;s better for you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Black and White note </em></strong>– get in touch with us and let’s discover whether you had a valid <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/service-spotlight-rd-services-at-black-white-accounting/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"118\">claim for R&amp;D tax credits</a> which you did not know about at the time. We can make R&amp;D tax claims for your previous two accounting periods on your behalf. Later this year we are expecting to see a review of this regime, with it potentially being increased to include advancements in mathematics (currently science and technology), so the regime will become even more generous.</p>\n<h3>3. Do you make money from patents?</h3>\n<p>If your company profits from the exploitation of…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patented inventions;</li>\n<li>Patents you own or have exclusively license in; and/or</li>\n<li>Work your company did which led to the creation of a patented invention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…you can use the Patent Box to lower the amount of corporation tax you pay on those profits from 19% to 10%.</p>\n<h3>4. Claim the capital allowance on property transactions</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-allowances/\">claim capital allowance</a> for expenditure on commercial buildings, fixtures, and chattels owned by your company. Depending on your current situation, you may be entitled to one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>enterprise zone allowances;</li>\n<li>structure and buildings allowances;</li>\n<li>fit-out <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/property-and-trade-allowances/\">allowances for leased commercial properties; and</a></li>\n<li>capital allowances on a property sale or purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Black and White note</em></strong> &#8211; this is a complicated area for which we recommend you seek professional advice.</p>\n<h3>5. Offer a share scheme to your staff</h3>\n<p>Corporation tax charged against your company&#8217;s profits may be reduced if your offer a share scheme to your employees.</p>\n<p>In addition to saving money, they&#8217;re very effective for motivating staff and gaining their longer-term loyalty.</p>\n<p>Ask us about Share Incentive Plans, Save As You Earn (SAYE), Company Share Option Plans, and Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs).</p>\n<h3>6. Use as much of your Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) as possible to bring down your tax bill</h3>\n<p>Each year, every company can use its Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) to invest in plant and machinery and costs related to them.</p>\n<p>Capital allowance claims can also be made against expenditure on the following items and activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘know-how’ (intellectual property about industrial techniques);</li>\n<li>dredging;</li>\n<li>mineral extraction;</li>\n<li>patents;</li>\n<li>renovating business premises in disadvantaged areas of the UK;</li>\n<li>research and development; and</li>\n<li>structure and buildings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can deduct the full value of these items/activities and the associated costs from your profit to lessen your tax bill.</p>\n<p>On 1 January 2019, AIA was increased to £1 million but AIA was then reduced in value to £200,000 in January 2021. However, as part of the coronavirus schemes, this has been temporarily increased back to £1million for 1 January 2019 to 31 March 2023.</p>\n<p>The Super Deductions is also now live. From 1 April 2021 until 31 March 2023, companies investing in qualifying new plant and machinery assets will be able to claim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>130% first-year capital allowance for qualifying plant and machinery assets (similar to the R&amp;D tax regime); and</li>\n<li>50% first-year allowance for qualifying special rate assets can be claimed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will result in a saving of up to 25p for every £1 invested in new qualifying equipment.</p>\n<h3>7. Claim any work from home allowance you&#8217;re entitled to</h3>\n<p>You can benefit from further corporation tax relief by working from home, which is relevant to many as we explore different ways of working going forward.</p>\n<p>You can allocate a proportion of the business-related expenses you incur by working from home to you company &#8211; for example, telephone calls, insurance, internet access, and more. Alternatively you can use the HMRC rate, which has seen publicity like never before during coronavirus.</p>\n<h3>8. File and pay your tax bill on time&#8230;</h3>\n<p>There are a series of fines and penalties for late filing and payment of Corporation Tax which your company will avoid completely if you hit HMRC&#8217;s deadlines.</p>\n<h3>9. &#8230;better still, pay ahead of time</h3>\n<p>Very few companies want to pay HMRC but early payment and being this tax efficient has its benefits.</p>\n<p>If you make early payment of your corporation tax (six months and 13 days after the start of your accounting period), HMRC will pay you interest of 0.5%. Every little helps (sorry)</p>\n<h3>10. Use your personal tax allowance effectively</h3>\n<p>Everyone in the UK earning under £100,000 has an annual personal tax allowance of £12,500.</p>\n<p>Many <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> directors pay themselves mainly in dividends but this is often not the most efficient way to do so.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">pay yourself a salary up to your personal limit, you won&#8217;t pay any income tax but you and your company will have to pay some National Insurance</a> (NI). Or you can pay yourself up to the primary NI threshold and you will pay no income tax and neither you nor your company will pay NI.</p>\n<p>Either way, the amount you pay yourself as a salary will provide tax relief to your limited company because salary paid via the PAYE system is a tax deductible expense.</p>\n<h3>11. Make pension contributions</h3>\n<p>Likewise, pensions are also tax deductible expenses for limited companies but this is a more complicated area on which you should take professional advice. We work with some great strategic partners who would love to help you further with this.</p>\n<h3>12. Creative industry relief scheme</h3>\n<p>If your company is in the creative industry and more specifically involved in producing or developing animated television, children’s television, films, high-end television, museum or gallery exhibitions, orchestral concerts, theatrical productions, or video games, there are various tax reliefs available which permit you a higher level of allowable annual capital expenditure – a kind of special AIA scheme for creative companies.</p>\n<p>Incentives are also available for companies involved in the decision making process in these productions and/or if your company directly negotiates, contracts and pays for rights, goods, and services for these productions.</p>\n<h3>13. Business mileage tax reliefs</h3>\n<p>If your staff use their personal car for business purposes, they can claim mileage rate expenses from your limited company &#8211; this is one of the most popular ways to lower company tax bills.</p>\n<p>For the first 10,000 miles you travel in an accounting year, your employees can claim 45p per mile. For travel over 10,000 miles, the amount they can claim is 25p per mile.</p>\n<p>There are also similar allowances for travel and subsistence which you should consider.</p>\n<h3>14. Tax-free staff party or parties</h3>\n<p>One popular way to reduce your tax bill is to pay for an annual <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/xmas-2020/\">staff party</a> &#8211; or parties throughout the year.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure that you keep your annual spending per head to no than £150 per year otherwise HMRC will consider as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/its-that-time-of-the-year-again-benefits-in-kind-p11d/\">benefit in kind</a>&#8221; and each employee’s share of the costs of the parties will be considered by the taxman as part of their pay packets.</p>\n<p>Spending more than £150 a head means that you and your employee will have to pay tax on the party or parties you hold for them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Black and White note </strong>&#8211; a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">benefit in kind is non-cash benefit</a> which small business owners can provide to their employees but whose monetary value must be reflected in an employee’s wages. Its inclusion in employee wages means that it is taxable.</em></p>\n<h3>15. Tax-free parties and treats for yourself</h3>\n<p>&#8220;Trivial benefits&#8221; are tax-saving perks which you can reward your directors and employees with instead of extra pay with without the monetary value of those rewards being subject to tax or NI.</p>\n<p>No gift can cost more than £50 including VAT and the total value of gifts awarded to directors under the scheme cannot exceed £300 per year.</p>\n<p>All gifts, if wholly and exclusively are treated as expenses and therefore qualify for corporation tax relief.</p>\n<h3>16. Use a company mobile phone</h3>\n<p>With more of us working from home than ever before (even before Coronavirus), many small business owners are giving their staff company mobile phones to make and receive calls. Line rental and call charges incurred by your use and your staff&#8217;s use of mobile phones is a legitimate business expense you can claim against as long as the phone remains the property of your limited company at all times.</p>\n<h3>17. Claim subscriptions and training costs against your tax bill</h3>\n<p>Any training you purchase for yourself or your staff and any professional subscriptions to trade bodies are claimable providing an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"139\">opportunity for further tax</a> relief for your limited company.</p>\n<h3>18. Claim tax relief for previous annual losses</h3>\n<p>One of the most commons ways to reduce your corporation tax bill is to claim back all available loss reliefs.</p>\n<p>You can either carry back a loss to a previous year or you can carry them forward to reduce future tax liabilities.</p>\n<p>As part of the coronavirus support schemes, there is also the opportunity to carry back losses three years, as opposed to one. This is a temporary measure that will apply to losses for accounting periods ending between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2022.</p>\n<h2>How to reduce your corporation tax Quick FAQ</h2>\n<h3>What is corporation tax?</h3>\n<p>Corporation tax is a tax on company profits. Who has to pay corporation tax? Every private and public limited company.</p>\n<p>The due date for payment is nine months and one day after the end of your accounting period and the due date for the filing of your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">corporation tax returns</a> is 12 months after the end of the accounting period. For example, if your accounting period ends on 31st December, you must pay your tax by the following 1st October and file your corporation tax return by the following 31st December.</p>\n<h3>Is trying to reduce your corporation tax legal?</h3>\n<p>Yes. All limited companies are legally entitled to tax relief on each allowable business expense they&#8217;ve incurred in the course of their business.</p>\n<h3>Do dividends reduce corporation tax?</h3>\n<p>No &#8211; dividends are redistributions of cash from a company to its shareholder after corporation tax has been deducted.</p>\n<p>There are no tax reliefs related to the payment of dividends</p>\n<h3>What does lower corporation tax mean?</h3>\n<p>It means that you have more money to invest in your business now and in the future.</p>\n<p>The money you save you might keep in the bank for a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">healthier cash flow</a> or you might want to employ extra staff or purchase new plant and machinery to give your business a competitive advantage.</p>\n<h2>Keep more of what you earn &#8211; use every way to reduce corporation tax relief available to you</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll use our experience and knowledge of the tax system to legitimately reduce the amount of corporation tax your business pays; we don&#8217;t want our client&#8217;s to be paying more tax than they need to be.</p>\n<p>Black and White helps hundreds of small business owners and corporate clients in the South of England and across the UK to reduce their corporation tax bill through the efficient and accurate use of each available tax relief.

      "content": "<p>Making Tax Digital (‘MTD’) is an HMRC initiative attempting to transform the UK tax system, with more regular and detailed submissions of information and payments of tax to HMRC electronically.</p>\n<p>Whilst it has been delayed several times, it aims to make tax administration more effective, efficient, and easier for taxpayers through the implementation of a fully digitalised tax system, whilst also reducing HMRC’s overheads for managing tax affairs.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The first wave saw VAT registered businesses, with a turnover over £85,000 (‘the threshold’) submitting their VAT returns either through compliant software, such as FreeAgent, Quick Books, Sage, Xero or a bridging software. If the business is VAT registered but turnover is beneath the limit, they could opt-out. All businesses here should now be compliant.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s happening in 2022</h2>\n<p>From 1 April 2022 it is now mandatory for all VAT-registered businesses to use MTD-compliant software or bridging software. Previously this only applied to VAT-registered businesses who had turnover over £85,000, as explained above, as businesses beneath this threshold could choose to opt-out.</p>\n<p>Despite many delays in the rollout, HMRC confirmed that this will be going ahead, despite the current climate stating “…MTD is succeeding in its central aims of reducing errors, while also making it faster to prepare and submit returns and boosting productivity for businesses.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, where the VAT period commences on or after 1 April 2022, VAT returns will need to be submitted electronically to HMRC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your VAT quarter ends in March, your first MTD submission will be for the quarter ending 30 June 2022, which needs to be submitted by 7 August 2022.</li>\n<li>If your VAT quarter normally ends in April, then your first MTD submission will be for the quarter ending 31 July 2022, which needs to be submitted by 7 September 2022, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, all of your transactions and business details must be recorded (and stored) digitally on a line-by-line basis.</p>\n<p>Please note now there is no “opt out” option for MTD. If you are a VAT registered business you are expected to comply with MTD for VAT, unless you are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-exemption-from-making-tax-digital-for-vat\">“digitally excluded”</a>.</p>\n<h2>What do I do, if this is me?</h2>\n<p>If you are already using a form of accountancy software, check if it is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat\">MTD-compliant</a>. If it is already compliant, then you won&#8217;t need to buy any additional software. If it isn&#8217;t MTD-compliant, you don&#8217;t use any specific software or you are not sure, please get in touch with us today and we can discuss options with you. If you are for example using an Excel spreadsheet, it is possible to use a bridging software from the spreadsheet in order to digitally link to HMRC, or we can offer some cost-effective solutions to you.</p>\n<h2>Future roll-out of MTD</h2>\n<p>OK, don&#8217;t quote us on these, but here is HMRC&#8217;s current roadmap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-employed businesses and landlords with annual business or property income above £10,000 will need to follow the rules for Making <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">Tax</a> Digital for Income Tax from 6 April 2024. There is a pilot ongoing here, as we speak;</li>\n<li>A consultation is on-going on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a>, but HMRC have confirmed it will not be mandatory before 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will of course keep you updated as this evolves.</p>\n<h2>How can B&amp;W help me?</h2>\n<p>We offer software implementation and training on any of the above mentioned bookkeeping software and many others besides.

HMRC opens investigations to see if the taxpayer has paid the right amount of tax on a random or selective basis.  All this helps the government fill its ever expanding public finance black hole.</p>\n<h2>Beware of “Connect”!</h2>\n<p>HMRC now uses a sophisticated database called ‘Connect’ to start more than 80% of tax enquiries. The system collects data from 30 different sources, including UK and offshore banks, Companies House, the Land Registry, estate agents, the DVLA and other licensing authorities, and social media.</p>\n<p>Using ‘Connect’, HMRC can now target enquiries more accurately than ever before – but they still get it wrong sometimes. That’s why we will always challenge HMRC regarding their reasons for an investigation when defending clients.</p>\n<h2>What could an investigation involve?</h2>\n<p>HMRC will write to you or visit your business premises. They will potentially want to review all your books and records or will ask for more detailed information about specific transactions on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">your Tax Returns</a>. At the end of the investigation <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"169\">HMRC</a> may look to raise an assessment for additional tax due. If you are subject to investigation we will respond to HMRC’s requests for information and/or attend meetings with HMRC. We will provide our workings with detailed explanations and we can dispute any assessment for additional tax due.</p>\n<h2>Where our service comes in</h2>\n<p>If the HMRC states its intention to investigate your tax payments don’t panic.

Many may find themselves somewhat underwhelmed by the changes, with the cost of living increasing at the highest rate since records began nearly 70 years ago.</p>\n<p>Here is a detailed summary of the key announcements made, for the year ahead and further into the future. &#8220;[T]oday’s statement builds a stronger, more secure economy for the United Kingdom&#8221; Do you agree? We summarise the key headlines <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2022-key-headlines/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Key Changes in the year ahead</h2>\n<h3>National Insurance</h3>\n<p>From July 2022, the threshold at which workers will start making Class 1 and Class 4 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance contributions (NICs)</a> will increase to £12,570, in line with the income tax personal allowance. In the Autumn Budget, Sunak announced a new 1.25% health and social care levy to be added to Class 1 and 4 National Insurance rates. Despite sustained calls to at least delay this hike, the Chancellor today confirmed that it would still be implemented from 6 April 2022.</p>\n<p>According to the Chancellor, the higher NICs threshold will mean around 70% of all workers will have their taxes cut, even after paying the extra 1.25% health and social care levy. However, it appears the tipping point here is for those earning £34,000-£35,000; from this point, workers will still be paying more tax due to the levy.</p>\n<h3>Fuel Duty Levy</h3>\n<p>To help with spiralling petrol prices, not helped by the Ukraine-Russia war, fuel duty will be cut by 5p per litre, taking effect from 6pm tonight until March 2023. This is only the second time the duty has been cut in 20 years, saving the average car drive £100 over the next year and van drivers around £200. It is reported to be the biggest ever cut for all <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/fuel-costs-calculator/\">fuel duty rates</a>. This saving is significantly less however than the recent fuel price increases and for perspective, UK fuel duty is currently 57.95 pence per litre for petrol and diesel despite many years of freezes. This will cost the taxpayer an estimated £5b.</p>\n<h3>VAT on Energy Saving Materials</h3>\n<p>VAT will be reduced from 5% to 0% to pay for homeowners investing in energy saving materials such as solar panels, heat pumps or insulation for the next five years. It is hoped this will stimulate further energy savings investments, which will further be encouraged by recent energy price rises. Wind and water turbines will also be included within the scope going forward. It is estimated that a family having a solar panel installed will see tax savings worth over £1,000 and an energy bill saving of over £300 per year.</p>\n<h3>Household Support Fund</h3>\n<p>For the most vulnerable households, Sunak announced the Household Support Fund is being doubled to £1bn. This fund was first introduced in November 2021, and its support was initially due to end on 31 March 2022. Local authorities will receive the extra funding from April 2022, and can choose how to divide it among those most in need in their local areas.</p>\n<h3>Public Sector Fraud Authority</h3>\n<div class=\"well standfirst\">\n<p>To combat the UK&#8217;s ‘fraud epidemic’ the Spring Statement announced that the government will create a new public body called the Public Sector Fraud Authority. Based with £48.8m worth of funding over the next three years, it will work alongside and enhance the counter-fraud work by the British Business Bank (BBB) and the National Intelligence Service.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-body\">\n<p>The body will help enable government and enforcement agencies to step up their efforts to reduce fraud and error, recover millions of pounds lost to fraud and ‘bring fraudsters to justice’.</p>\n<p>The government said that the creation of the new public sector body will put ‘counter-fraud at the heart of decision-making’. This is needed after the scale of fraud related to the recent covid bounce back loans.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Employment Allowance</h3>\n<p>Mr Sunak has announced that the Employment Allowance for business will increase by £1,000 from £5,000 from April 2022, making it cheaper for businesses to hire workers.</p>\n<h2>Future Changes</h2>\n<h3>Income tax rate cut</h3>\n<p>In 2024, basic-rate income tax is due to be cut from 20% to 19%. It’s estimated that more than 30m people will benefit from a tax cut of around £175, and it will be the first time the basic <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-rates-allowances/\">rate of income tax</a> has been cut for 16 years. This will cost the taxpayer an estimated £6b.</p>\n<h3>Reformed business investment taxes</h3>\n<p>To address the lack of capital investment in UK businesses, the government is looking for ways to reform taxes around business investment. Plans will be confirmed at the Budget later this year. Reforms to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-research-development-tax-credits-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">R&amp;D tax credits</a> will be announced in the Autumn, broadening the definition to include mathematics. Currently an advance is in either ‘science’ or ‘technology’ and guideline’s definition of these concepts does not include maths.</p>\n<h3>Simpler tax reliefs and allowances</h3>\n<p>The Autumn Budget could herald some big tax changes, as the government’s <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"168\">Tax Plan</a> document says it’s seeking to simplify the tax system – which could mean an overhaul of the 1,000 existing tax reliefs and allowances. However, we hate to sound cynical, but we&#8217;ve heard this several times before and most &#8220;simplifications&#8221; lead to a growth in the amount of tax legislation which we will leave you to draw your own conclusions on.</p>\n<h2>What Wasn&#8217;t in?</h2>\n<p>Some of the key things which were conspicuous by their absence in the Spring Statement, included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There was no place for Labour&#8217;s windfall tax on the “super profits” of energy companies, aiming to cut household gas and electric bills. The cost and likely increase in future household gas and electric bills were cited for this.</li>\n<li>As noted above, the additional 1.25% health and social care levy to be added to Class 1 and 4 National Insurance rates from from 6 April 2022 is still going ahead despite pressure to at least postpone this from both sides of the house. The increase in threshold will reduce the impact of this on lower earners however.</li>\n<li>There are no significant changes in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax/\">Capital Gains Tax</a>, Pensions and R&amp;D, although the latter is coming.</li>\n<li>There was no increases in benefits or increases in public sector workers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, the devil is in the detail and more information will come to light as the dust settles.

      "content": "\n<p>When a director takes money out of a company and it is not classed as a salary or dividend, then it’s known as a director’s loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for this is that the money is viewed as a separate entity and not &#8211; unlike with a sole trader or partnership account – a straightforward action. In other words, a Director’s Loan Account (DLA) is a record of financial transactions between the director and the company itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An overdrawn DLA is when a director has taken out more money from the company than he or she has put in. And this is where, if not paid off in time, it can have serious tax implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time limit for a DLA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A DLA should always be paid within nine months of the company’s year-end accounts. If not, then problems will arise if the loan was more than £10,000 and if the interest you paid your company for it was beneath the official rate (which, from April 2023 is 2.25 per cent).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s because this will be viewed as a beneficial loan (ie you haven’t paid the interest you would have on a ‘standard’ bank or building society loan).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overdrawn DLA and company liquidation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the company is insolvent and there is an overdrawn DLA then the loan itself will be viewed as an asset. As a result, the director will be pursued for the money by a liquidator. This isn’t unusual when it comes to company liquidation, with around 75 per cent of directors using a DLA when the company faces a cash crisis. And, because of this, it’s usually the first place a liquidator looks when trying to find company money he can use to settle creditor’s bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Writing off a DLA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if a company, prior to liquidation, decides to ‘write off’ the loan, that’s not simply the end of the matter. This is because the liquidator can overturn that previous decision to ‘write off’ the money owed and insist the director does indeed pay what he or she owes the company. The only occasion in which a liquidator may conceivably agree with writing off a director’s loan is if the amount is so small as to be almost negligible. In, fact, if it’s the case that there are so few assets in the company then the liquidator may simply opt to strike off the business on the Companies house register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a serious matter for a director who can’t pay off their loan. It could, for instance, lead to personal insolvency procedures, where the only way to remedy the situation is to declare bankruptcy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A director may be able to reduce the amount of the loan owed if they have purchased furniture, supplies or equipment etc for the company from their own personal bank account. They could then deduct this from the loan. Alternatively, it could be that there are expenses they haven’t yet claimed for (ie travelling, hotels, etc) and which they can also subtract from the debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to ‘rid’ itself of a director’s loan is if a company decides to ‘award’ the money as a bonus or dividend to the director. If the company is then made insolvent, a liquidator will no doubt uncover this and question whether this was in the best interests of the company. If not, the director will usually be asked to repay the loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax and an ODL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A director will have to pay tax on his or her overdrawn loan account – even if the company is already insolvent. That’s because HMRC will view the amount of the loan as a company asset. The tax, which comes under a Section 455 code (also referred to as S455), is paid by the company and is in addition to Corporation Tax. The current tax rate for the period 23/24 is 33.75 per cent. Loans made on or after April 6, 2022 are charged at 32.5 per cent. The interest due is reported to HMRC on form P11D. National Insurance is also due and reported on form P11DX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the S455 is paid within nine months after the company year-end then it’s refundable (albeit, it can take some time for the payment to come through from HMRC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if a director’s loan is written off by the company, it will still be subject to tax because this is viewed as personal income for the director. Those who are taxed on a higher rate will find their tax bill rising quite considerably. National Insurance contributions will also need to be paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Too busy or feel overwhelmed by the accountancy practices for your small to medium-sized business?

Once you receive your NI number it will never change so it’s a good idea to memorise it for future use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why do I need a National Insurance number?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the government using your NI number to collect contributions from your pay, your NI number can be used for a number of formal procedures. For instance, your Electoral Registration Office will want to know it to ensure that you’re entitled to vote. Other reasons include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Claiming Housing Benefit, Disability Allowance, the State Pension and other benefits</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Applying for a student loan</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your pension provider</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Applying for a driving licence</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opening an Individual Savings Account (ISA)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When buying stocks and shares</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where do I get my National Insurance number?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every resident in the UK is sent their NI number by HMRC a few weeks prior to turning age 16. The government gets the information from Child Benefit claims. If your parents didn’t apply for Child Benefit then you can notify the government of your existence and the need for an NI number by applying online <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number/how-to-apply\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be that you have spent some time in local authority care as a ‘looked after child.’ In these circumstances it is usually a social worker who applies for your NI number. You are then sent your NI number directly. If you haven’t received it then again, use the above number to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I’ve lost my National Insurance number</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve tried looking for your NI number in all the places we’ve mentioned above and you’ve still had no joy, then you can contact HMRC directly. This involves filling in <a href=\"https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/get-your-national-insurance-number-by-post\">form CA5403</a> and sending it to the address on the form. As well as providing a number of personal details you’ll also have to attach copies of a passport or driving licence. The personal details you’ll be asked include present and past home addresses, benefits claims in the past and your employment history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also ring the National Insurance Registrations helpline, 0300 200 3500. For those not currently living in the UK you can call +44 191 203 7010. These lines are manned Monday to Friday from 8am to 8pm and on Saturday from 8am to 4pm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I’ve never had a National Insurance number</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be the reason you don’t have an NI number is because you’ve recently moved to the UK from abroad. You’ll only get an NI number if you can prove that you have the right to work in this country. If you’ve been granted a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) then you’ll find the NI number written on the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also be asked to prove you are indeed who you say you are. This is via a photograph which you have to take and upload. This can be with a smartphone, digital camera or a tablet. You’ll be asked to photograph yourself holding identity documents, such as a passport or driving licence. If it’s easier, someone else can take the photograph for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your application has been sent online it’s simply a case of waiting to hear. You may receive an email asking you to attend a meeting with someone from HMRC. Or, you may be asked to send further identification documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long does it take to get my NI number?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people who apply for an NI get it through in around four weeks. But it you’ve moved house since or one or more of your personal details have altered, then it might be an idea to contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number/how-to-apply\">application helpline.</a> Have your application number ready to quote when you call so your file can be accessed quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For help in accessing your National Insurance number, as well as help with your business accounts then why not ring us?

      "content": "\n<p>Every employee in the UK has a tax code – regardless of whether you work full-time or part-time. It allows your employer to work out how much income tax and national insurance should be deducted from your wages or private pension. This is via the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only individuals who are self-employed don’t have a designated tax code, and that’s because they send in a self-assessment form to the government every year, which then works out how much their income tax and national insurance bill is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a tax code?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But, getting back to the tax code… this takes the form of numbers and letters which is provided for you by the government. Don’t just leave it there though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always important to check that you’ve been given the correct code – otherwise you could be losing out on a lot of money or worse, get a tax demand to pay up a lot of money because you’ve been underpaying (even though you didn’t designate the tax code in the first place). If you have been underpaying through no fault of your own you’ll be given reasonable time to pay back the missing tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax code changes every time the personal allowance threshold is increased (or decreased). That’s because the numbers in the code correspond with the amount you are allowed to earn annually before paying tax. This is called your personal allowance and is currently £12,570 for the 2023/2024 tax year. If you’re married or in a civil partnership then you’ll be allowed to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/married-couples-allowance\">earn more.</a> Someone who is blind will also have a higher allowance figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Checking your tax code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find your current tax code in various ways, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>On your wage slip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On a P45 (which you get when you leave a job)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On a P60 (from your employer and shows how much tax you’ve paid that year)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On a private pension advice slip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Online via the government website where you can see your personal tax page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A tax code notice from HMRC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ask your work’s HR department</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What do the letters in the tax code stand for?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>L</strong> – you’ll get the basic personal allowance</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BR </strong>– you won’t get a personal allowance because it’s is already being used for your principle job or pension. You’ll be taxed basic rate of 20% on both jobs</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DO </strong>– you’ll be taxed at the higher rate of 40%</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>OT </strong>– you’re taxed at the additional rate of 45%</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>K</strong> – you don’t have a personal allowance because you’re paying back tax or work benefits you get are more than the personal allowance figure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Y – you’re older than 75 and entitled to the maximum personal allowance</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>M or N</strong> – Your non-tax-paying spouse or civil partner has transferred £1,260 of their personal allowance to you (who are on a basic rate)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>NT</strong> &#8211; you won’t pay any tax on income from your job or pension</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>T </strong>– your tax code is complicated and HMRC want to review it</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>W1</strong> – you are paid weekly and currently on an emergency tax code</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>M1</strong> – same as above but you’re paid monthly</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>X</strong> – another emergency tax code</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re put on an emergency tax code you’ll pay more than you usually would. It’s because the government hasn’t had the correct up-to-date information to work out your tax code yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This usually happens after an individual changes jobs or moved from being self-employed to employed. It can also be if you’re no longer receiving benefits from your job or you’ve started receiving state benefits which are subject to tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax categories and how much you’ll pay</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Basic-rate taxpayers are charged at a rate of 20 per cent of income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Higher-rate taxpayers (those earning from £37,701 to £125,140 pay 20 per cent</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional rate taxpayers (with an income of £125,140 and above pay 45 per cent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to check your income tax code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible to find out how much tax you’ve paid for the current year, and what your code is, by accessing the government website <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-income-tax-current-year\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe you’ve paid too much tax then you can contact HMRC directly on 0300 200 3300. Otherwise, if they spot an overpayment they’ll refund the amount, which you should receive in your next pay or. If you’re self-employed you can make a claim for a refund <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/claim-tax-refund\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you haven’t paid enough tax then you’ll receive a P800 from HMRC. This is a tax calculation they’ve completed showing you are due to pay more. If it’s a large amount then you can set up a payment plan so that it’s more affordable for you. If you’ve underpaid due to an employer’s error then you can ask for an A19 (or extra statutory concession).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Too busy to keep up with your tax accounts?

      "content": "\n<p>Post-pandemic more people than ever before have found themselves working from home – at least for some of the week. The ‘hybrid’ model working where it’s common to divide your working day between home and the office is pretty much standard fare for most employees these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many freelancers working life didn’t really change much during the pandemic since they had already worked full time (or part-time) hours from home. And it’s actually those self-employed workers for whom this article is really for. The reason being if you’re an employee then your opportunities for claiming much money from home working are pretty slim. Having said that, they’re not non-existent – especially if your employee contract states that some of your working time must be spent at home. In this case, you <em>will</em> be able to claim back home expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of being freelance as far as HMRC is concerned, you can do this as a sole-trader, a limited company, in partnership with another person, or working as a contractor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What kind of home expenses can I claim?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of running costs you can write off against your tax bill when you fill out a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns\">self-assessment form</a> as a sole trader or if you’re in a partnership are varied. These range from a portion of your gas, electricity and even rent/mortgage to buying Google ads and going on training courses. Here’s a quick list:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Telephone, internet, and mobile phone bills</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Part of your rent or mortgage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Utility bills (gas, electric, water) and council tax</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Home contents and buildings insurance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office equipment such as a computer, printer etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office furniture ie desk, chair, lamp etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Home security costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Public liability insurance (if clients come to your home)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Training costs ie whether online or night class etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Promotional expenses (ie buying google ads, your website hosting and design costs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repair costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel costs are permissible provided it’s for getting or coming back from work to your home. It includes hotel rooms, parking charges and flight costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Staff costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subscriptions to trade magazines or websites you use for business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Legal and financial costs ie bank, overdraft and credit card charges and interest paid for hire purchase agreements and loans</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clothing expenses – if the items are protective clothing, a uniform or specifically required for work purposes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax stipulations for working from home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First though, to claim relief for working from your home there must be a dedicated space you use as an office, or playroom, studio etc. In other words, using the dining table for a few hours every day or going outside selling most afternoons won’t work. The room for which you’re claiming must be used for your business – even if you just store boxes full of promotional material etc in it. That’s because it’s a room that your family don’t use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use a co-working space outside your home you can claim in full for rental costs – but you wouldn’t then be able to add a claim for your house or apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rental or mortgage costs. </strong>You can claim a portion of these if you work 25 hours or more from home. HMRC have a flat rate that you can claim per month, increasing the more hours worked:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>25-50 £10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>51-100        £18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>101+ £26</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also claim for a portion of the actual expenses themselves ie how much heating, lighting etc you used. With the cost of utility bills having tripled over the past year or so, you’ll get more tax relief calculating this way. To do so divide what you pay by rent or in mortgage payments by the number of rooms in your home. Alternatively, you can do it by room size ie if your home measures1,000 square metres in total and you use use 100 square metres (or 10 per cent) as an office, then it’s possible to claim 10 per cent of home expenses such as utility bills, heating, rent and insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you and your partner both work from home and use the same office then you can both only claim 50 per cent of the tax relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limited company and rent.</strong> If you have a limited company and work from home then it’s possible to ‘rent’ the space from yourself as the owner of the property. That way you know exactly how much to deduct from the business for use of your home as a business. You can claim this when you fill in an HMRC <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/company-tax-returns\">company tax return.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Employees and rent. </strong>If you work for a company as an employee then you are more restricted in the home relief you can claim. For instance, it’s only utilities, phone bills, metered water costs and other minor home expenses you can claim for. Again, there are stipulations. For instance, the home work must be in the employee contract (rather than a choice), it must be a main part of the job and necessary (ie it’s not possible to do the job in the office due to a lack of facilities etc). In certain cases the employer themselves may reimburse the employee with a tax-free set amount of £18 per month. If more than this then it has to be no more than the employee actually spends working from home (ie to ensure he or she isn’t profiting).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax myths about working from home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And as for those tax myths we mentioned in the title, here’s the most common:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Claiming for mileage between home and work. </strong>HMRC refer to this as commuting. It’s only when you go on to a client from your office premises that you can claim. If your office is at home then provided the journey is wholly for business then it’s fine to claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Claiming for your lunch and snacks.</strong> It’s only permissible to claim for a reasonable cost for lunch, dinner etc if you are away from your normal work location on business. This could be meeting a client half way across the country and you’ve had to stay overnight. It could also be during a day’s training course in another city.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Confused about what you can and can’t claim for while self-employed? Or maybe you simply don’t have the time to sort out your accounts. If so, here at Black and White Accounting we can help.

      "content": "\n<p>When you first start out in business it’s usually as a sole trader. Then you find sales really taking off and before you know it – usually within two to three years – you’ve hit that £40,000 plus profits mark. And you really could do with another pair of hands in the business – or even three pairs. It’s at this point that you should be considering switching from a sole trader to a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-should-i-call-my-limited-company/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"94\">limited company</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because, quite bluntly, it makes perfect sense in tax terms. Instead of paying the higher rate income tax band of 20 per cent you can pay corporate tax at 19 per cent instead. Unless, that is, your company earns £250,000 annually and then you’ll pay 25 per cent corporation tax. Even so, this is still much less that additional rate of income tax, which is 45 per cent tax for profits more than £125,140.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason for setting up a limited company is that it’s the best way to take on a co-director. You might also find that larger companies will only work with a limited company or an umbrella company – rather than a sole trader. That’s because they don’t have to handle the tax and admin side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are, of course, other reasoning involved and actually, going from a sole trader into a limited company isn’t for everyone. That’s because, for starters, the new structure means you may have to seek consensus for major business decisions. That, in turn, can slow down business. Limited liability companies are the most popular form of business structure in the UK at this moment in time. So, if you’re considering this move, or want to know more about it, then read on. One of the areas we look at in this article is the pros and cons of incorporation which, we hope, will help you make a better-informed decision on the matter:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does ‘incorporate’ mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By ‘incorporate’ we mean registering your business, as a limited company, with Companies House. The name of your company, it is directors and when it was formed etc will be made public record. Your tax accounts for the year are also updated and made public.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros of incorporating your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax savings.</strong> In addition to saving with corporation tax, a company director can pay him or herself in dividends <em>and</em> a salary. If your salary is less than the current personal allowance (ie what you can earn without paying tax) of £12,570 a year and the rest is in dividends then you won’t pay income tax at all. You will pay tax on the dividends but it’s not much in comparison.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited liability.</strong> With a limited company your business finances are separate from your personal fortune. That means if your business goes under you won’t be obliged to sell your home and other personal assets, such as a car, to pay off your creditors. Neither will your credit rating be affected. In other words, you have a ‘limited liability.’ That’s not the case with a sole trader, whose business and personal finances are inextricably linked.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pension savings.</strong> As a ‘company employee’ (ie director), it’s possible to write off your pension payments as tax-deductible expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Selling on.</strong> Being a shareholder of a limited company makes it much easier to sell the business when you want to retire or move on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Director status.</strong> When you become the director of a successful business you develop a certain self-image. And that’s not a bad one to have!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cons of incorporating your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Increased admin.</strong> As well as filing your accounts with Companies House on an annual basis, as a limited company you will also be obliged to get forms ready for submission; maintain statutory registers and provide shareholder documents etc. Failure to do so in time can have severe financial repercussions or, in the worst-case scenario, can lead to a jail sentence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complicated decision-making.</strong> When you have other directors and shareholders, you can’t make all the big decisions yourselves; it has to be a joint affair. This can slow business down and it also takes away your own autonomy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Public property</strong>. When you file with Companies House your accounts are online for all to see – whether you like it or not. That includes how much profit or loss you made and which directors you took on that year or who, at director-level, resigned etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bigger accountant bill</strong>. The more complicated your accounts (ie additional form filling etc) then the more you’ll pay for your accountant. Having said that, a good accountant will easily pay for him or herself by saving you more money in the long-run.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to incorporate your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To set up as a limited company you’ll need a name (check it hasn’t already been taken by someone else) and an address. In fact, having a registered office address is a legal requirement. It could be your home address or even that of your accountant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There must also be at least one director and one shareholder. You will also require a four-digit code – Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) – to identify the type of business you fall in to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, it’s time to register with Companies House. Once you’ve done this they’ll send you a ‘certificate of incorporation’ and on which you’ll see your company number. If you’ve registered online you will automatically be signed up to pay Corporation Tax. If your incorporation was via post then you’ll have to remember to sign up for Corporation Tax within three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contact us today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not sure whether incorporating into a limited company is the sensible option for you?

      "content": "\n<p>Part and parcel of running a business is managing your company accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you do that yourself, or hire a professional accountant is immaterial. Just so long as you keep records of any invoices, receipts, expenses, bills, VAT and PAYE records etc that you’ve used to calculate your year-end accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn’t just make running your business easier because, provided your filing system is neat, you can access previous years paperwork, and assess how you’re doing year on year. But it’s also the law. And here’s what you need to know about the paperwork side of things:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long to hang on to paperwork?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a sole trader then you must keep the relevant documentation for up to six years (or five years from your tax return’s last filing date). Unless, that is, you’ve bought machinery or another asset that you expect to last longer than that, so should hold on to the receipt etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules for limited companies are slightly different. They have to keep more documents, such as a list of assets, liabilities, secured loans and shareholder transactions – and all for up to six years. But certain documents, such as minutes of board meetings and VAT Mini One Stop Shop records, must be kept for up to a decade. The company register should be retained indefinitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Penalties for poor record keeping</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a mess of your record keeping by throwing away receipts, losing invoices and not keeping a record of cash you take for personal use, etc and you’ll encounter the wrath of the tax man. That could lead, not only to a fine of £3,000 but also a ban on being a company director. There may also be legal consequences, a court fine and, in serious cases, imprisonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Word gets around and if you’ve been pulled up by HMRC for poor record keeping then that’s not exactly a good look for you or your business. It can lead to a loss of credibility and that could affect how your customers, suppliers and investors feel about the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have the time or are worried you’ll make a mess of the accounts then it makes perfect sense to have a professional accountant do them for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why you should keep good records</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to monitoring the financial progress of your company, keeping up-to-date and accurate business accounting records allow you to plan better for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also makes paying tax easier since you can lay your hands-on whatever needs included in that year’s tax return. A late return will result in financial penalties. Also, HMRC may ask to see past year’s records if they want to check you’re paying the correct amount of tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A very good reason to keep good accurate accounting records is that it allows you to do regular audits. This can help you ensure that there’s no theft or fraud occurring in the company. It can also help you identify areas of the business where you could make cut backs to increase profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employee records or customer accounts are also easier to locate when your filing system is up to the mark. That means you can check which employees may need training, a promotion or wage rise etc.&nbsp; Or, you can follow up on customer feedback and complaints more readily. You can also use the records to look at your customers’ past purchases to help with marketing and promotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What business records to keep</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need information on what the company owns, how much money has been spent and received, and any debts (whether owed or accrued).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also need to keep records of stock that’s been bought and sold together with any purchases you’ve made for the business, and what you’ve sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sales ledgers, invoices, till rolls can also be used as evidence of sales, while petty cash books, delivery notes, orders and receipts will show expenses. Bank statements can provide further info, so too can VAT records (if your company is registered). If you are VAT registered and exceed the £85,000 threshold then you must keep digital records (under the Making Tax Digital scheme). These too must be retained in compatible software for up to six years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have employees in the company then you’ll need to keep records on what you pay them, their tax code and other details, any absences and, if relevant, documents for the Payroll Giving Scheme. Employee benefits should also be highlighted. This includes Statutory Sick Pay, Paternity Pay etc. Unlike the company’s financial details these records don’t have to be kept for up to six years; HMRC deems three years sufficient in this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to keep your business records</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These days there is plenty of accounting software and apps out there to record and work out your tax. But, of course, that’s only half the battle. You have to know what to record and to remember to do it. An accountant can keep you on your toes in respect of demanding certain paperwork and knowing what rebates you are entitled to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people still prefer to use paper and certainly, invoices and receipts still arrive this way. You can, however, take images and load them onto your computer as a backup in case your filing isn’t all it should be or coffee gets spilled on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where to keep those accounting documents</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people who run limited companies keep their records and registers at the company’s registered address. Others choose to keep them at a Single Alternative Inspection Location (SAIL) address. This is fine, provided you alert Companies House.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remain complaint with the law and credible in the eyes of your customers by ensuring your accounts are up-to-date and accurate. If you don’t have the time or the inclination to do them yourself, then you can ring the team here at Black and White accountants, tel: <a href=\"tel:08001404644\">0800 140 4644</a> or contact us via our website right <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/contact-us/\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Not every company needs to be registered to pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Only those businesses who meet certain criterion need to go down that route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially this means your taxable turnover is more than £85,000 in a year (fixed until March 2024). Other reasons you will have to register are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you suspect your turnover will exceed the £85,000 amount within the next 30 days</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your business isn’t in the UK yet you are a UK resident</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You don’t live in the UK</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You provide goods or services to the UK (or will do within the next 30 days)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you anticipate reaching the VAT threshold the following month, then it’s important to register with HMRC within 30 days to avoid incurring any penalties. This will depend on how late you register and how much VAT you owe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you exceed the limit for a short period for a short period of time ie a week or two, then you can apply for a registration ‘exception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason you might have to register is if you take over a business which is already VAT registered and if your turnover together with that of the business is more than £85,000 in that 12-month period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, your VAT registration date the first day of the second month when you exceeded the £85,000 threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What exactly is VAT?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT is charged on both goods and services here in the UK. But it can also apply to some services from other European countries. It’s a tax that you’ll have to add on to customer’s invoices and which is then paid to HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your turnover is less than the threshold £85,000 amount, it’s still possible to register for VAT. Unless that, is, the goods you sell are exempt from VAT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of being VAT registered</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re VAT registered it’s possible to claim back all the VAT you’ve paid – as opposed to non-registered companies who may be charged VAT on certain goods and services but can’t claim the money back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only that, but if you are predominantly a B2B business (ie sell to other businesses rather than the public) then your customers will more than likely also be VAT registered. This means they too can look forward to a VAT cash refund at the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT rate charges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT is charged at 20 per cent on all goods and services in the UK. Unless, that is, they are classed as ‘reduced’ or ‘zero-rated.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If ‘reduced’, then the VAT rate is five per cent. Goods that fall into this category include sanitary products, children’s car seats, gas and electricity for the home and the installation of energy saving items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goods marked as ‘zero per cent’ include food (from supermarkets, corner shops etc), children’s clothing, newspapers and bus, train fares etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are another two categories – Exempt and Outside the Scope. The first includes services such as fundraising, insurance, credit lending and education. No VAT is applicable here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second, is for MOT tests, wages etc. These are not considered to be eligible for VAT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is it worth zero-rated companies registering?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The goods or services a company provides may not be zero-rated, but other purchases made under the company name may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farmers, for instance, can claim back VAT on machinery they buy. Grocers and children’s shoe shops can reclaim VAT they’ve paid on furnishing their store and other equipment or services bought for promoting the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Different types of VAT schemes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>VAT flat rate.</strong> Businesses with a taxable turnover of less than £150,000 can apply for this. It keeps book-keeping simple since you’ll be applying a fixed percentage fee for VAT.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT cash accounting.</strong> A scheme eligible for companies learning less than £1.35m, VAT is only paid on sales once your customers have paid you. Once you’ve paid VAT, this too can be claimed back straight away. This makes cashflow much easier since you’re not having to wait 12 months for your VAT refund.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Annual accounting. </strong>A quick and easy way to pay, just fill out a return once a year, rather than every quarter. You can even may payments every so often (estimated) so that you’re not hit with a huge bill at the end of the year. You’ll get a refund if you’ve overpaid.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, a limited company doesn’t have to be VAT registered, provided it hasn’t reached the VAT threshold. However, there are instances in which it may benefit the company to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Need advice on registering for VAT?

      "content": "\n<p>If you’re about to hire someone to help out with running your business then it’s time to think about registering them for PAYE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An acronym for Pay As You Earn, the scheme is administered by HMRC and it’s how your employee will pay income tax and national insurance. You have to deduct the amount they will liable for before they receive their first pay. Even directors have to be registered for PAYE if they are an employee of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When do I use PAYE?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to register an employee with PAYE under certain conditions – even if your employee ticks the box for just one of these, they have to go on the government’s PAYE scheme. These are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They earn more than £123 a week</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They claim expenses or get employee benefits</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They get pension contributions from the company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They have another job</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your employee didn’t meet any of these conditions and doesn’t have to go on PAYE you still need to keep a record of what your paid them. This is also an annual record of why you deemed them unsuitable for PAYE. It must be kept for three years in the event HMRC want to check. Remember to make a note of data protection rules when keeping employee records too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I know how much to deduct?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use payroll software to work out how much your employee should be paying in income tax and national insurance. This information will then be sent directly to HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this though you will need a tax code for the employee. Using their P45 from their previous employer, go to the government’s website and use the tool there to calculate the code. Working out the employee’s <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/where-can-i-find-my-national-insurance-number/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"129\">national insurance number</a> is easier as it’s based on age and employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have both the income tax and national insurance codes you simply ender them into the payroll software and this will make those deductions. If the employee has student loans to pay off or want to pay into a company pension scheme then these must also be deducted at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to then send this information to HMRC on a monthly basis under what is known as the Real Time Information (RTI) system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do expenses and benefits get taxed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And bonuses and benefits, together with sick pay that your employee receives must also be taxed prior to them being paid. It’s only expenses that aren’t since the employee has already paid these out of his or her own pocket. The payroll software allows expenses to be entered before it calculates tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Full Payment Submissions?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is when, via the payroll software, you let HMRC know how much pay your employee has received and what’s been deducted. This has to be sent before your employee receives his or her pay, or on the day itself. The only exception is if you haven’t received their P45 or they’re being paid on a weekend when the banks aren’t officially open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re late letting them know you might receive a financial penalty (unless it’s your first time – in which case you may simply receive a ticking off).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Typical PAYE mistakes to look out for</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the wrong tax code for an employee is a big no-no as far as HMRC is concerned. So too is forgetting to remove an employee from the payroll once they’ve left your employ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be too that you’ve forgotten to put in overtime or a bonus, or you’ve lumped expenses in with pension payments etc. In other words, getting the details mixed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the payroll forms I need to know about?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main PAYE forms that you’ll probably encounter. These are P45s, P60s and P11Ds and all can be obtained via the payroll software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A P45 is issued when you employee leaves. It tells them (and you) what they have paid in income tax and national insurance during that tax year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A P60 is handed to every employee to let them know how much tax they’ve paid that year. They should receive this by May 31 every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A P11D outlines to employees how much tax they have paid on their benefits ie if they have a company car. This should be issued before July 6 annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to be mindful of</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If may be that you use casual Saturday staff in your business who don’t need to go on the payroll because they don’t earn more than £123 a week. That’s fine – until their earnings meet the personal allowance threshold (currently £12,570) or get another job, and then they will be liable for tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What else do I need to know?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other matters to look out for when taking on an employee for your business include checking they have the right to work in the UK. You must also let them know of the workplace pension scheme and check you are in line with the government’s minimum pay legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have more than one employee and are considering taking on even more than undertaking the regular requirements for payroll can prove quite an effort. Outsourcing your payroll responsibilities can take the pressure off you and give you more time to get on with your business.

      "content": "\n<p>Whether or not you can receive a State Pension in the UK depends on a number of factors, such as your age and how many years of National Insurance (NI) you have paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both men and woman are entitled to a State Pension when they turn 66. But there are plans to increase this to 67-years of age from May 6, 2026. This will apply to everyone born on or after April 1960. But it doesn’t stop there. In 2037, the government says, the pension age will increase to 68-years (although there are rumours this increase may actually occur earlier than planned ie in 2033). Regardless of when they take place the government says the increases are due to the fact that more people are living longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned, a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-essential-guide-to-state-pension/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"71\">State Pension</a> isn’t automatic on age. For instance, you will only receive this income if you have paid at least 10 years of NI contributions over your working lifetime. And, to be entitled to the full pension, you must have at least 35 years of NI payments. Less than this and you will receive, what is deemed, a ‘part pension.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone aged 16 and over, who is employed and earning more than £242 a week, pays NI. So too does a self-employed individual with an annual income of more than £6,725.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible to get NI credits if you can’t work because you’re ill, caring for someone else or a parent looking after kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve had a period of unemployment, taken a career break or have been freelance and may have missed NI payments then it’s often possible to ‘buy back’ those years when you paid no NI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What exactly is the State Pension?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason NI payments are so crucial to the State Payment is because this is what makes up the ‘pension pot.’ Your pension is then paid to you by the government on a regular basis, usually every fortnight or monthly, paid into your bank account. The amount you receive will increase every year as the State Pension attempts to keep up with the economy as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much State Pension will I receive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re entitled to the full State Pension then you will receive £203.85 a week in 2023. That’s a weekly jump of around £18 (or around 10 per cent) from the previous year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to calculate your State Pension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Had quite a number of jobs over your lifetime (which isn’t unusual these days), coupled with periods of ‘time out’ and freelance work? If so, then you may be unsure of exactly how many years of NI contributions you’ve made. This is easy to check – and it’s quick. Simply go to the UK government website <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-state-pension\">here</a> and it will forecast your pension for you. Before you can do this though you will need your government gateway number first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to ‘top up’ your NI contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have accessed the forecast you’ll see how much NI you have paid on a yearly basis. The site also highlights the years where no NI contributions were made, together with the lump sum you need to pay to ‘bring that year back up-to-date’ so that it counts towards your total NI years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Voluntary contributions.</strong> Paying off a lump sum is referred to as ‘topping up’ or making ‘voluntary contributions.’ Doing so makes sense if you’re nearing pension age and don’t have enough years of NI to qualify, or paying for additional years will give you the maximum pension entitlement. You won’t be able to pay back all years, just the more recent ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pension postponement</strong>. Those who reached pension age in April 2016 could defer taking it. For every nine weeks deferred the pension increases by one per cent. That means, for every year you put off receiving the pension, it increases by around 5.8 per cent. This can prove a good idea if you continue to work on. In this case you won’t pay NI, but any earnings would still be subject to tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spouse contributions.</strong> Those on the basic State Pension (ie who qualified under the old scheme pre-2016) can increase their pension income by adding contributions made by a husband or civil partner (as well as a former husband). Meanwhile, if a spouse or civil partner dies then it’s possible the surviving partner may inherit his or her pension (if it’s worth more than their own). In this instance DWP will make the adjustment themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pension credit. </strong>If you are on a low income then you may qualify for what is known as ‘pension credit.’ This is extra money to ‘top up’ your pension. For instance, to bring your weekly income up to £201.05 if you’re single or to a joint £306.85 with a partner. If you’re disabled and have a weekly income that’s higher, you might still qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Changes to oversees credits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time (pre-2021) when it was possible to claim NI credits if you were working abroad in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. But the law changed last year so it’s no longer possible, meaning you’ll have to ‘top up’ your NI contributions to make sure the full pension is yours when you retire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Applying for your pension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that although you will receive a letter from the government around four months prior to the date you’re eligible for the State Pension, you will still have to apply for it. In other words, it won’t be sent automatically. The quickest way to do this is to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/how-to-claim\">go online here.</a> You will need to use a code from the retirement letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When to retire</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that there is no age at which you must retire. In the past this was 65, but now you can keep working for as long as you like. In other words, unlike yesteryear, your employer can’t insist that you ‘down tools.’ There are exceptions, such as if you no longer have the physical or mental capacity to do the role. You can, however, still be <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/redundancy-or-whats-the-alternative/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"31\">made redundant</a> or be dismissed for underperforming etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for advice on your pension entitlement for when you retire?

      "content": "\n<p>A dividend voucher is pretty much like a receipt for a dividend payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is given out by a private or public company which is limited by shares. The purpose is to confirm to those shareholders how much of the profits they will receive at any given time. This could be via an interim dividend, an annual dividend or a fixed dividend, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2018 the issuing of dividend vouchers has been a legal tax requirement. The vouchers must be issued for every dividend paid within a particular tax year. This can be done every month, quarterly or annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dividend vouchers are then used to verify payments for tax purposes &#8211; both by the company and the shareholders when filling in their self-assessment tax forms as dividends are ‘income’ and must be accounted for <em>(more on this later under Dividends and Self-Assessment).</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a company dividend?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dividends are a means of ‘dividing’ profits to the shareholders (or investors) of a company. As such, they are usually given out by the company accountant. The dividends are distributed once Corporation Tax has been calculated. The number of dividends an investor receives is based on how many shares he or she owns in the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit for the company of doing so means the money is retained for business use (unless a particular investor cashes in his or her shares).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also a tax-efficient way of taking money from a limited company if you are self-employed or a small business owner. That’s because no tax is due (as it would be if the money was being paid to an employee, for instance). A company director can take a low salary and also pay him or herself in dividends to cut back on their tax bill (if it’s below the NI threshold). Because of this, dividends can’t be considered an expense when it comes to the company’s accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does the dividend voucher say?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On this voucher you’ll find the amount the dividend is worth, together with the signature of at least one company director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also contain the name of the recipient, together with their address. Likewise, the name and address of the company issuing the dividend will be listed, together with the date. The type of shares owned and how much will also be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always a good idea to keep copies of these dividend vouchers on file in case a recipient loses their vouchers and needs it for tax purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why are dividend vouchers really necessary?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is the act of producing dividend vouchers a legal requirement for a company, but failure to do so could result in an HMRC investigation. The outcome could be penalties or, worse still, a finding of tax evasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What other proof of dividends is needed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the dividend voucher, another way a company can prove it has distributed dividends is by revealing the minutes of a ‘dividend’ board meeting. The meeting is, in any case, another legal necessity since it shows that the board voted for the dividends and that it was approved by a director (or directors) of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dividends and self-assessment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive dividends you may have to fill out a Self-Assessment form to declare this to HMRC (if you don’t already pay tax this way). This is regardless of whether the dividends came from your own company or another business in which you have shares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the dividends aren’t from your company, and the total amount received in dividends is less than £10,000 then it may be possible to ask HMRC to change your tax code. That way you won’t have to fill out a Self-Assessment form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax-free dividend allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn £2000 or less in dividends for the tax year 2022/23 then you won’t have to pay any tax on the amount. The following tax year (2023/24) tax year the threshold figure is reducing to £1,000. For the tax year it will reduce even further to £500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax-free dividend allowance is in addition to your Personal Tax-Free Allowance of £12,570.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at Black and White we can help you produce dividend vouchers, together with the dividend board minutes for your company.

      "content": "\n<p>The UK Government is gearing up for the Autumn Budget on Wednesday 30<sup>th</sup> October 2024, which always brings potential changes to the tax landscape. With a change in Government and a change in ideas, changes in the UK tax system seem inevitable. As a forward-thinking accountancy firm, we know that staying informed and proactive is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. Here’s a rundown of some of the potential changes we might see in the upcoming Budget and how they could affect you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Income Tax Adjustments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One area that’s consistently under review in every Budget is personal income tax. Although the Chancellor has previously committed to maintaining the current rates until at least 2026, there is always a possibility that changes could be introduced, especially in light of recent economic challenges. Possible changes could include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adjustment of Income Tax Bands:</strong> There might be a review of the income tax bands, potentially freezing personal allowances, or adjusting the higher-rate threshold. If thresholds are frozen, more individuals could find themselves in higher tax brackets due to wage inflation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>National Insurance Contributions (NICs):</strong> We could see changes to NICs, possibly increasing rates for higher earners or tweaking the thresholds to ensure a more progressive system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> Keeping an eye on these potential changes is essential for budgeting and financial planning, especially if you are self-employed or running a business where income fluctuates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Overhaul</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has been hinting at potential reforms to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for some time now. In the previous Budget announcements, CGT remained largely untouched, but this could change. The following modifications are possible:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Harmonising CGT with Income Tax Rates:</strong> One of the proposals on the table is to align CGT rates more closely with income tax rates, which could lead to higher CGT liabilities for individuals disposing of assets, including property and investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduction of the Annual Exemption:</strong> The annual CGT exemption may be reduced, which means more individuals would face a CGT bill when selling assets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> If you are considering disposing of assets, it may be worth revisiting your plans with an accountant to potentially optimise your CGT position before any changes come into effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Corporation Tax Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporation Tax has been a focal point for the government, especially following the economic effects of the pandemic. While rates rose to up to 25% for businesses with profits over £250,000 from April 2024, there could be further changes in the Budget, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Incentives for Small Businesses:</strong> To support small businesses, the Chancellor might introduce new reliefs or incentives, such as enhanced allowances for capital investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reassessment of R&amp;D Tax Credits:</strong> The government has been reviewing R&amp;D tax credits, which could result in changes to the rates or qualifying expenditure criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> If you run a small business, it’s vital to stay updated on these changes, as they could significantly affect your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"138\">tax planning</a> and overall profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. VAT Reforms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Value Added Tax (VAT) system is another area that could see reforms in the upcoming Budget. Although changes to VAT rates have a broader impact on the economy, there is speculation around:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Changes to VAT Registration Threshold:</strong> The current threshold of £85,000 could be altered, potentially bringing more small businesses into the VAT system.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sector-Specific VAT Adjustments:</strong> The government might introduce reduced VAT rates for specific sectors, such as hospitality, to continue supporting industries hit hardest by the pandemic. A 20% VAT rate is planned to be introduced on private school fees from 1 January 2025 and it appears unlikely that this will be delayed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> VAT changes can affect pricing, cash flow, and accounting processes, so staying informed is key, especially if your business is close to the registration threshold or operates in a potentially affected sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Inheritance Tax (IHT) Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inheritance Tax (IHT) has long been a contentious topic, and there have been ongoing calls for reform. Potential changes could include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Threshold Freezing:</strong> The IHT nil-rate band may be frozen further, bringing more estates into the tax bracket over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Changes to Reliefs:</strong> Business Property Relief (BPR) and Agricultural Property Relief (APR) could see adjustments to limit the scope of their application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> If you have an estate or are involved in estate planning, it’s wise to keep an eye on these potential changes and plan accordingly to optimise your position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Can You Prepare?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With potential changes on the horizon, it’s essential to be proactive. Here’s how we can help:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review Your Finances:</strong> We can work with you to review your current financial and tax situation, ensuring you are in the best possible position to adapt to any changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> By keeping informed about the potential changes, we can help you develop a strategic plan, whether you’re an individual, a small business owner, or an investor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> Our team will continue to monitor the Budget announcements and keep you updated on any changes that may impact your finances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get In Touch today!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay Ahead – Stay Informed with Black &amp; White Accounting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Running a small business or microbusiness can feel like you’re wearing all the hats—CEO, marketer, HR, finance, legal, and everything in between. While it’s rewarding, it’s also a huge challenge, and it’s easy to get bogged down by the day-to-day tasks. We’ve seen firsthand how focusing on the right areas can make the difference between surviving and thriving. Here’s your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-small-business-guide-to-accounting-success/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"61\">guide to boosting your business success</a> and setting yourself up for growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Master Your Finances Early On</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes new business owners make is ignoring their finances until the tax is due. Having a firm grasp on your financial health from the get-go will prevent stress, save you money, and give you better insight into how your business is performing. Here’s how to stay on top of your finances:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Separate business and personal accounts</strong>: This is non-negotiable. Mixing personal and business finances creates confusion and makes it harder to track your business&#8217;s true performance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use accounting software</strong>: Tools like Xero, QuickBooks or FreeAgent can help you automate invoices, track expenses, and generate reports at the click of a button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review financial reports regularly</strong>: Don&#8217;t wait for the end of the year. Regularly check your profit and loss statement, balance sheet, and cash flow to understand where your money is going.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial discipline will give you the confidence to make better decisions, avoid cash flow problems, and grow your business with stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Know Your Numbers: Profit vs. Cash Flow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many small business owners focus solely on profit and overlook cash flow, which can be a fatal mistake (or worse turnover). Your business may be profitable on paper, but if you don’t have cash in the bank, it’s game over. The key is to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create a cash flow forecast</strong>: This helps you predict when cash is coming in and going out so you can plan ahead for lean months.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invoice promptly and follow up</strong>: Ensure that your invoices are sent as soon as work is completed and follow up on any late payments. Consider offering incentives for early payment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep reserves</strong>: Aim to build a cash buffer to cover unexpected expenses or delays in payments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding your cash flow gives you more control and prevents nasty surprises that could cripple your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Know Your Tax Responsibilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxes are one of the most important aspects of running a business, but they can also be one of the most confusing. Whether you’re a sole trader or running a limited company, you need to be aware of your tax obligations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Self-Assessment</strong>: If you&#8217;re a sole trader, you’ll need to submit a self-assessment tax return every year, detailing your income and allowable expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT</strong>: If your business turnover exceeds £85,000, you must register for VAT. Even if you’re under this threshold, voluntary VAT registration might benefit you if your customers are VAT-registered.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax</strong>: Limited companies must pay corporation tax on their profits. You also need to file your company’s <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"167\">tax return within 12 months of the end</a> of your accounting period.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an accountant can help ensure you meet deadlines and don’t pay more tax than necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Leverage Tax Reliefs and Grants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK offers numerous tax reliefs and grants to help small businesses, but many entrepreneurs aren’t aware of them or don’t take full advantage. Some key tax reliefs include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>R&amp;D Tax Credits</strong>: If your business is involved in innovation or development, you may be eligible for research and development tax credits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Annual Investment Allowance</strong>: This allows you to deduct the full value of qualifying equipment or machinery from your profits, up to £1 million.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business Grants</strong>: Depending on your industry, location, or the nature of your business, you may qualify for grants from local authorities, the government, or private organizations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An experienced accountant can help you identify and apply for tax reliefs and grants that are right for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Set Clear Business Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every successful business starts with clear goals. Whether you’re looking to increase revenue, expand your product line, or hire your first employee, setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals can provide direction and motivate you to stay on track. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Break goals into smaller tasks</strong>: If your goal is to increase sales by 20% in the next six months, break it down into actionable steps such as improving marketing, adding new products, or targeting new customers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review and adjust</strong>: Set quarterly reviews to assess progress and adjust your strategy if needed. Business goals should be dynamic, not set in stone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracking and celebrating your progress keeps momentum and helps you stay focused on long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Develop a Marketing Strategy That Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive, but it does need to be effective. Many small businesses rely on word of mouth, but you can supercharge growth by focusing on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understanding your customer</strong>: Who are they, where do they spend their time, and what problems are they trying to solve? The better you know your customer, the more targeted your marketing can be.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Using social media</strong>: Platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook allow you to connect directly with customers. Create engaging content, use hashtags, and interact with your followers to build a community.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leveraging email marketing</strong>: Building an email list is one of the most powerful tools for small businesses. Sending regular newsletters, offers, and updates keeps you top of mind with your audience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective marketing strategy builds brand awareness and drives revenue, even on a small budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Build Relationships with Your Customers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your customers are the lifeblood of your business. Building strong relationships with them will increase customer loyalty and encourage word-of-mouth referrals, which are invaluable for small businesses. To do this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Provide exceptional customer service</strong>: Be responsive, approachable, and always willing to go the extra mile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gather feedback</strong>: Ask your customers what they like and what could be improved. This not only helps you improve your products and services but also shows customers that you value their input.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reward loyalty</strong>: Whether it’s through discounts, referral programs, or a personalized thank-you note, rewarding customer loyalty can turn one-time buyers into lifelong customers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, a happy customer is your best marketing tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Surround Yourself with the Right Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to do everything yourself. Surrounding yourself with the right support system—whether that’s a business mentor, accountant, or legal advisor—can make a world of difference. A professional accountant, in particular, can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Save you time</strong>: Free you from the burden of managing complex financial tasks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Help you grow</strong>: Provide strategic advice on everything from cash flow management to business expansion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ensure compliance</strong>: Make sure you&#8217;re up-to-date with HMRC regulations and avoid costly mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a small business doesn’t mean you have to go it alone. Leverage expert advice to save time, money, and stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Embrace Technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology is the great equaliser for small businesses. Embracing the right tools can streamline operations, reduce costs, and help you scale faster. Consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cloud accounting software</strong>: Platforms like Xero, QuickBooks and FreeAgent allow you to automate invoicing, track expenses, and get real-time insights into your financial health.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CRM systems</strong>: Customer relationship management software helps you track interactions with customers, manage leads, and provide better customer service.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automation tools</strong>: Tools like Zapier and IFTTT can automate repetitive tasks like sending emails, social media posts, or tracking inventory.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ai-in-your-business-what-to-watch-out-for/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"14\">embracing technology</a>, you can spend less time on admin and more time focusing on growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Plan for the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, don’t lose sight of the bigger picture. Running a small business can be all-consuming, but it’s essential to take time to think about the long-term. Ask yourself:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Where do I want the business to be in five years?</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What steps do I need to take now to get there?</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Am I building a business that’s sustainable and scalable?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a clear vision for the future will guide your decisions today and ensure that your business continues to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let Us Help You Thrive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand the unique challenges faced by individuals and businesses.

      "content": "\n<p>A VAT inspection might seem like a nightmare scenario for many businesses, but with the right preparation, it doesn’t have to be! If HMRC has notified you of an upcoming VAT inspection, don’t panic—take a deep breath and follow our guide to help you navigate this process smoothly. As a UK accountancy practice specialising in supporting individuals and businesses, we’re here to offer expert advice on how to handle a VAT inspection with minimal stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Stay Calm—Understand Why You’ve Been Selected</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first—don’t panic! A VAT inspection can happen to any business, and it doesn’t always mean you’ve done something wrong. HMRC conducts VAT inspections for various reasons, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Random checks as part of routine compliance;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Large or unusual VAT claims;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inconsistent VAT returns; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Significant changes in your VAT activity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the inspection is to ensure that your VAT records and returns are accurate and that you’re complying with VAT regulations. It’s not an automatic assumption of wrongdoing, so stay calm and approach it methodically.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Review Your VAT Records</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first steps to preparing for a VAT inspection is to review your VAT records. HMRC will want to see:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>VAT invoices</strong> (both sales and purchase invoices);</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT returns</strong> that you’ve submitted;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bank statements</strong> to match transactions;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Evidence of <strong>imports and exports</strong> (if applicable); and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Records of <strong>business expenses</strong> that you’ve claimed VAT on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Go through these records carefully to ensure they are accurate, up to date, and easily accessible. If there are any discrepancies, make note of them and be prepared to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Check for Common Errors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Common mistakes in VAT returns can often trigger an inspection. These include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Claiming VAT on non-VATable expenses</strong>;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incorrectly applying <strong>VAT rates</strong> to your products or services;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Late VAT submissions</strong>; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claiming <strong>input VAT</strong> on items that aren’t eligible (e.g., certain personal expenses).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you spot any errors in your records, now is the time to correct them. HMRC is likely to be more lenient if you proactively address mistakes rather than waiting for them to be uncovered during the inspection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Get Professional Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT rules can be complex, and having an accountant by your side can make the whole process easier and less stressful. As specialists in supporting businesses through VAT inspections, we can help in many ways, including, but not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Help review your VAT returns and records;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Correct any errors before the inspection;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Represent you during the inspection to liaise with HMRC on your behalf; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure you stay compliant with ongoing VAT obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having professional help can also reduce the likelihood of penalties if any issues are discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Prepare for the Inspection Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC will typically give you <strong>notice of an inspection</strong>, although in some cases, they can arrive unannounced. Once you have a date for the inspection, it’s time to get prepared:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Organise your records</strong>: Ensure that all VAT-related documents are ready and accessible. This will speed up the inspection and show HMRC that you’ve taken it seriously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Notify your team</strong>: Let relevant staff know about the inspection so they can assist, if needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be ready to answer questions</strong>: HMRC inspectors will likely ask questions about your VAT processes, so make sure you’re familiar with your own records and can explain how you calculate VAT, handle VAT claims, and manage your business expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. During the Inspection: Be Open and Cooperative</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day of the inspection, the HMRC inspector will review your records and ask questions. The key to a smooth inspection is to be open, cooperative, and honest. Avoid being defensive or evasive—it’s better to be transparent and work with the inspector to resolve any potential issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the inspector raises concerns or asks for clarification, provide the necessary documents and explanations. If you don’t know the answer to a question or don’t have a document on hand, be honest and offer to provide it later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. What Happens After the Inspection?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the inspection is over, HMRC will either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Give you the all-clear</strong>, meaning your records are in order and no further action is needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Highlight areas for improvement</strong>: HMRC may find minor errors or discrepancies and ask you to correct them moving forward.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify issues requiring action</strong>: If HMRC uncovers significant errors, they may require you to pay additional VAT or issue penalties for underpayment or non-compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that if you’ve cooperated fully and any errors were unintentional, HMRC is likely to take a more lenient approach. They may ask you to correct the mistake and pay any underpaid VAT without heavy penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. How to Avoid Future VAT Inspections</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the inspection, it’s important to stay on top of your VAT obligations to avoid any future issues. Here are a few tips:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep detailed records</strong>: Make sure your VAT records are always up to date and organised.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit VAT returns on time</strong>: Late submissions can trigger inspections, so make sure your returns are filed by the deadline.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Conduct regular internal reviews</strong>: Periodically review your VAT processes to ensure everything is accurate and compliant with HMRC rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Don’t Panic—Get Prepared!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A VAT inspection doesn’t have to be a stressful ordeal if you’re prepared and organised. By reviewing your records, fixing any errors, and cooperating with HMRC, you can ensure the process runs smoothly and minimise any risk of penalties. And remember, you don’t have to go through this alone—at Black and White Accounting we specialise in supporting businesses through inspections, helping you stay compliant and confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need help with a VAT inspection?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact us today for expert support and advice to ensure your business is fully prepared!

      "content": "\n<p>Whether your business is just starting out or on the verge of scaling to new heights, having the right accountant by your side can make all the difference in the world. But what happens when your current accountant no longer feels like the right fit? You might be wondering how easy it is to switch to a new one. The good news is that <strong>changing accountants is easier than you think</strong>, and it could be the best decision for your business growth and&nbsp; ultimately, your future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At our dynamic and fast-growing accountancy practice, we are “<strong>Big Enough to Know and Small Enough to Care</strong>,” offering the expertise of a large firm with the personal touch of a boutique practice. We partner with our clients throughout their journey—&#8221;<strong>from inception, through growth, into maturity”</strong>—ensuring that you have the right support at every stage of your journey. Here’s why and how switching to a new accountant could be the game-changer your business needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Why Switch Accountants?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why businesses switch accountants, and it usually boils down to feeling like they’re not getting the support they need/deserve. Here are some common signs that it’s time to consider a change:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Poor communication</strong>: Your accountant should be a trusted advisor, not someone you struggle to get hold of when you need answers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lack of proactive advice</strong>: If you’re not receiving insights to help you grow your business or save on taxes, you’re missing out.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Outgrowing their services</strong>: As your business expands, your needs will change. You may require more sophisticated <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"166\">tax planning</a>, growth strategies, or financial forecasting than your current accountant can provide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>High fees with little value</strong>: You should feel confident that the fees you’re paying match the value you’re receiving. If not, it’s time to look elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing accountants is about more than just managing your books—it’s about finding a partner who shares your business vision and is ready to help you achieve your goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One funny thing we find is that a lot of potential clients have undue loyalty to their current accountants, even if they are not getting the level of service they deserve. And yet, if it was any other business decision, they would not hesitate to make the switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. How Easy Is It to Change Accountants?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thought of switching accountants might seem daunting, but in reality, it’s a straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Find Your New Accountant</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do your research and find a new accountant who understands your industry, goals, and challenges. Look for an accountancy practice that offers the right mix of expertise, personal attention, and scalability. This is where we excel. Our team is not just focused on numbers—we’re committed to being your <strong>business partners</strong>, supporting you through every phase of your journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Let Your New Accountant Handle the Switch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve chosen a new accountant, the good news is that <strong>they do most of the heavy lifting</strong>. All you need to do is inform your current accountant of your decision to switch. Your new accountant will handle the transfer of records, including obtaining the necessary handover documentation from your previous accountant.

      "content": "\n<p>In today’s turbulent economic climate, the UK Government faces a daunting challenge: how to raise the necessary finances to meet its <strong>electoral pledges</strong> without alienating voters. With public spending on the rise and national debt mounting, the Treasury must get creative in its approach to taxation. As a <strong>dynamic and fast-growing UK accountancy firm</strong>, we’re keen to explore innovative ways to generate revenue, and history provides plenty of food for thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the quirky taxes of the past to the forward-thinking ideas of the future, let’s take a look at <strong>alternative things to tax</strong> that could help the UK Government raise funds—while offering a glimpse at some unusual approaches from around the world. Will we see anything like these announced this week? Only time will tell…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Look to the Past: Odd and Outlandish Taxes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Window Tax (1696–1851)</strong><br>One of the UK’s most famous historical taxes, the <strong>Window Tax</strong>, was introduced in the late 17th century. Based on the number of windows in a property, it was a clever way to tax wealth without explicitly taxing income. The result? A rise in bricked-up windows across the country as people sought to avoid the tax! This tax persisted for over 150 years before being abolished, but it remains a fascinating example of how taxation can directly influence architecture and everyday life.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hair Powder Tax (1795)</strong><br>To fund the wars with revolutionary France, the British Government introduced a tax on <strong>hair powder</strong>, which was a fashion statement among the aristocracy. The tax was payable by anyone using the powder, leading to a dramatic decline in its popularity. As powdered wigs fell out of fashion, so did the tax, but it highlights how Governments can tap into cultural trends for revenue.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investment Income Surcharge (1965-1984)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>A tax in the UK that applied an additional rate on investment income for individuals with significant <strong>unearned income</strong>. It aimed to reduce income inequality by taxing higher levels of investment income at a higher rate than <strong>earned income</strong> from employment or business. However, this tax was abolished in 1984 as part of broader tax reform initiatives. Since then, the UK tax system has not reintroduced an explicit surcharge on investment income. Instead, individuals pay tax on investment income, like dividends, interest, and rental income, at specific rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Poll Tax (1990)</strong><br>One of the most controversial taxes in modern UK history, the <strong>Poll Tax</strong> (officially called the Community Charge) sparked widespread protests and ultimately contributed to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher. The idea behind the tax was to charge every adult the same amount for local Government services, regardless of income. However, its unfair burden on low-income households made it wildly unpopular. While its legacy may be tarnished, it serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between fair taxation and public acceptance.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Present Day: What Could Be Taxed More?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While taxes on income, property, and consumption dominate today’s tax landscape, the UK Government has several options to expand or increase taxes in areas that could raise substantial revenue:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Wealth Taxes</strong><br>Wealth inequality has been a growing issue, and many argue that the UK should follow the example of countries like <strong>Norway</strong> and <strong>Switzerland</strong>, which have wealth taxes on assets, investments, and property holdings. A progressive wealth tax could be a way to ensure that the richest individuals contribute more toward public finances, closing the gap between the ultra-wealthy and everyone else.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Luxury Goods</strong><br>Luxury items, from designer handbags to high-end cars, could be subject to higher tax rates. Countries like <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Italy</strong> already impose taxes on luxury yachts and expensive watches. Increasing taxes on such goods would target those with the means to pay, while sparing the broader population from additional burdens.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Digital Services and Big Tech</strong><br>The <strong>Digital Services Tax</strong> introduced in the UK in 2020 targets large tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, which derive significant revenues from UK users, whilst paying low effective rates of tax. With tech giants continuing to grow in power and profitability, increasing taxation on digital services could be a lucrative option, which would only impact a small group directly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Environmental Taxes</strong><br>With the UK’s ambitious goal to reach <strong>net-zero carbon emissions by 2050</strong>, environmental taxes could play a key role in funding green initiatives. Higher taxes on carbon emissions, plastic waste, or even single-use items like coffee cups and straws would not only raise revenue but also incentivise eco-friendly behaviours. <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong> have already implemented successful carbon taxes, and the UK could expand its current levies to potentially accelerate progress toward a greener future.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future-Proofing: What Could Be Taxed Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Governments look to the future, it’s worth considering <strong>new frontiers</strong> in taxation. Here are some forward-thinking ideas that could raise revenues in the coming years:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Robot Tax</strong><br>With automation and artificial intelligence (AI) poised to replace millions of jobs across various sectors, the idea of a <strong>robot tax</strong> has gained traction. <strong>Bill Gates</strong> famously proposed that companies using robots to replace human workers should be taxed on the productivity gains they achieve. This would not only slow the pace of job losses but also provide funds for retraining displaced workers. As the UK economy becomes increasingly automated, this could be an innovative way to ensure that human workers aren’t left behind.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Space Tourism Tax</strong><br>As companies like <strong>SpaceX</strong>, <strong>Blue Origin</strong>, and <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong> push the boundaries of space travel, the market for space tourism is set to grow. A tax on <strong>space tourism</strong> could become a reality in the near future, ensuring that those wealthy enough to venture beyond Earth contribute back to the national coffers. Similar to luxury taxes, this would target a small, affluent demographic without impacting the broader public.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data Tax</strong><br>In an increasingly digital world, <strong>personal data</strong> is becoming one of the most valuable commodities. With companies collecting vast amounts of user data to drive their businesses, some economists argue that a <strong>data tax</strong> could be imposed on businesses that profit from this information. It could act as both a privacy protection measure and a revenue source, especially as Governments seek to regulate big tech companies more tightly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Crypto Transaction Tax</strong><br>The rise of <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> has been a game-changer in the financial world, but their tax treatment remains murky. Governments are beginning to impose capital gains taxes on <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-does-hmrc-treat-bitcoin-profits/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"232\">crypto</a> profits, but the future could see more direct taxation on <strong>crypto transactions</strong> themselves. As more people and businesses adopt digital currencies it is key that the Government try to ensure that they’re taxed in line with other assets/transactions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Fine Balance: The Future of Taxation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As history shows, taxes come in all shapes and sizes, from the bizarre to the brilliant. With the UK Government facing increasing pressure to meet its financial obligations, exploring alternative forms of taxation could be key to balancing the books while maintaining public support. In all likelihood, the Budget this week will see changes in allowances and rates of tax and we do not expect any innovative or exciting changes, but we can hope. Do you have any game-changing thoughts or ideas here to help the Government? &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses and individuals stay ahead of the curve, no matter how the tax landscape evolves. Whether it’s navigating the complexities of wealth taxes, preparing for environmental levies, or understanding the implications of a robot-driven future, we’re here to guide you through the ever-changing world of taxation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get in Touch:</strong> Curious about how future tax changes could affect your business?

      "content": "\n<p>It’s official! After a 14-year hiatus, Labour has delivered its first Budget, bringing with it bold reforms across tax, business support, and social spending. At Black and White Accounting, we’ve dissected the announcements to highlight the key moments that matter most for you and your business. With specific rate changes, new allowances, and targeted incentives, Labour’s budget introduces both opportunities and important adjustments to navigate. Here’s a brief summary, with a more details summary to follow shortly, once we have seen more of the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Corporation Tax Overhaul: Targeted Relief and Green Investment Incentives</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour made a decisive move with Corporation Tax by holding the main rate at 25% but introducing new reliefs to encourage growth and sustainability. Companies investing in green technology and renewable energy solutions can now benefit from additional capital allowances, enabling eligible businesses to offset 130% of investment costs against profits. Additionally, a new <strong>Investment Allowance of £1 million</strong> per year has been introduced for SMEs, making it easier to invest without triggering large tax bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For our clients in green industries or those looking to expand, this is a significant opportunity. We can help you leverage these allowances to boost your bottom line.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Income Tax Adjustments: Easing the Cost of Living</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour introduced changes to income tax thresholds to provide relief for lower and middle-income earners. The <strong>Personal Allowance has been raised to £13,000</strong> (from £12,570), and the <strong>higher-rate threshold increased to £55,000</strong> (from £50,270). These changes mean more take-home pay for many, especially those in middle-income brackets, as well as a new <strong>45% tax rate for earnings above £150,000</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For individual clients, this shift could mean more available income, and we’ll help you plan for any changes in withholdings and potential reliefs.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. National Insurance Changes to Support Small Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour’s Budget reduced National Insurance (NI) contributions for businesses with fewer than 50 employees, introducing a new <strong>reduction of up to 15%</strong> on NI contributions. This move is aimed at encouraging small business growth and making it more affordable to hire, which could prove invaluable to businesses looking to expand their teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you’re considering hiring or expanding, this could be a beneficial change. Reach out to us for support in navigating these new NI policies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Enhanced R&amp;D Tax Credits for Innovation and Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) tax credits have been enhanced to stimulate innovation. Eligible businesses, especially those in tech, healthcare, and green sectors, can now claim up to <strong>25% of qualifying R&amp;D expenditure</strong>—an increase from the previous 13%. This generous relief is designed to incentivise businesses to innovate and maintain the UK’s competitive edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you’re working on innovative projects, these credits can reduce your tax bill significantly. We’re here to help ensure you qualify and claim every penny available.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. VAT on Energy-Saving Products Cut to Zero</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a push to encourage eco-friendly home and business upgrades, Labour has eliminated VAT on energy-saving materials and products such as solar panels, insulation, and heat pumps, slashing it to 0% (down from 5%). This change makes it more affordable for both businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint and invest in sustainable energy solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If your business or home is considering green upgrades, this VAT relief makes it an excellent time to move forward with energy-saving investments.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Stamp Duty Relief for First-Time Buyers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To tackle the housing crisis, Labour has increased the threshold for first-time buyers’ relief on Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT), now set at <strong>£350,000</strong> (up from £300,000). For properties above this amount, first-time buyers will pay a reduced rate, making homeownership more accessible to young people and families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For clients looking to purchase their first home, this could reduce upfront costs. We’re here to guide you through any tax implications for first-time buyers.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Childcare Support and Family Reliefs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the cost-of-living crisis, Labour has announced substantial increases in childcare support, with an additional <strong>£1,500 in childcare tax credits per year</strong> available to families earning under £50,000. The goal is to alleviate childcare costs for working parents, giving them the support needed to return to or remain in the workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For families, this provides a substantial relief opportunity, which we can help integrate into your overall financial strategy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Energy Price Cap and Household Reliefs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of fluctuating energy prices, Labour has committed to a capped rate on household energy bills for the next two years. While details on the exact cap are still emerging, it promises relief for individuals facing high energy costs, with rebates available directly through utility providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For those impacted by rising energy costs, these capped rates and rebates could mean more manageable household expenses. We’ll be keeping a close eye on the finalised cap details to provide our clients with updated advice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Inheritance Tax Threshold Freeze</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour announced a freeze on the Inheritance Tax (IHT) threshold, keeping it at <strong>£325,000</strong>. While this freeze provides stability for many, it may lead to higher tax liabilities in the long term as property values continue to rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For clients with estates approaching this threshold, strategic planning is more important than ever. Reach out to discuss options for tax-efficient legacy planning.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts: Seizing Opportunities and Preparing for Change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour’s first Budget in 14 years introduces a mix of reliefs, allowances, and targeted <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"165\">tax increases that could create opportunities</a> and adjustments across the board. As always the devil is in the detail and as we read more, we will provide a more detailed summary for you to review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we’re here to ensure that you’re well-prepared to navigate these changes, seize opportunities, and position your business or personal finances for success.

At Black and White Accounting, we know that understanding the full picture is essential for effective financial planning, so we’re here to highlight the changes that may impact you negatively—and what you can do to mitigate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at the adjustments in rates, allowances, and reliefs that could affect your bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Annual Exemption Cut</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant downsides is the <strong>reduction of the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) annual exempt amount</strong> from £6,000 to <strong>£3,000</strong>. This cut is likely to impact investors, property owners, and anyone selling valuable assets. The reduced exemption means that individuals will pay tax on a greater portion of their gains, potentially increasing their tax liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What to consider: For those with significant assets, strategic planning around sales, gifts, and transfers is more important than ever. We can help explore options like using tax-efficient investment vehicles and offsetting gains with losses to minimise the impact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Inheritance Tax (IHT) Threshold Freeze Amid Rising Property Prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Inheritance Tax (IHT) threshold remains frozen at £325,000</strong> despite climbing property values, which could push more estates over the taxable threshold. This freeze essentially increases the likelihood of IHT liabilities for many families as property and asset values continue to rise, making efficient estate planning more crucial than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Our advice: Proactive planning around IHT can make a substantial difference. We’re here to help with strategies like gifting, trusts, and other planning tools to reduce the IHT burden on your loved ones.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Higher National Insurance (NI) for Some Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While smaller businesses received an NI reduction, larger businesses face an increased burden, with <strong>National Insurance Contributions (NICs) rising by 1%</strong> for businesses with more than 50 employees. This change is likely to affect medium-sized companies already contending with rising costs and wage pressures, and it may slow down hiring and growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What to consider: For businesses affected, it’s worth reviewing workforce planning and employee benefits. We can advise on structuring payroll to reduce the impact, as well as exploring reliefs or incentives that may help balance the higher NICs.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Income Tax Band Adjustment for Higher Earners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-key-moments-from-labours-first-budget-announcement-in-14-years/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"100\">Labour’s Budget</a> brought a <strong>new 45% income tax rate on earnings above £150,000</strong>, effectively creating a higher tax band. Additionally, with the <strong>higher-rate threshold raised to £55,000</strong>, some individuals previously in the higher band may find themselves paying even more tax as they move up into the new band.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What to consider: For high earners, this change makes it more valuable than ever to explore tax-efficient savings, pension contributions, and other income-shielding options. We’re here to help optimise your tax strategy to manage these additional costs.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Reduced Pension Lifetime Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a significant shift, the <strong>Pension Lifetime Allowance</strong> has been reduced to <strong>£900,000</strong>, down from over £1 million. This means that high earners nearing retirement may hit this threshold faster, leading to an additional tax charge on any contributions or growth beyond this limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Our advice: If your pension is approaching this threshold, now is a critical time to review your retirement strategy. We can work with you to explore options like alternative savings vehicles or even restructuring your pension contributions to help avoid excess charges.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Corporation Tax Complexity: New Reliefs But No Rate Drop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the headline <strong>Corporation Tax rate stays at 25%</strong>, the Budget introduced multiple new reliefs for green and tech investments, making it more complex for businesses to understand what they owe. Businesses that don’t meet the specific criteria for these reliefs may see no reduction in their tax rate but still face increased administrative burdens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What to consider: For businesses without qualifying green or tech projects, it’s essential to plan for the full 25% rate. We’re here to support you in finding efficiencies elsewhere and exploring any reliefs or incentives that may be available.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Reduction in Tax-Free Dividend Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>tax-free dividend allowance has been reduced from £1,000 to £500</strong>. This will impact shareholders, business owners, and anyone relying on dividend income as a significant source of earnings. With this lower threshold, more dividend income will now be subject to tax, which could decrease net returns for investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Our advice: For business owners and investors, it’s worth revisiting your income strategies. This may include exploring other tax-efficient distributions, drawing income via different structures, or timing dividends to minimise tax.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. VAT Rise on Digital Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To align with international tax standards, VAT on digital services provided to consumers has increased to <strong>20% from 5%</strong>, impacting businesses offering digital goods and services. This change could raise costs for businesses providing digital services to UK consumers, especially smaller companies without a large pricing buffer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What to consider: For digital businesses, it may be necessary to adjust pricing strategies or explore efficiencies to offset this VAT increase. We’re here to help with guidance on VAT-compliant pricing structures and cost-management strategies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Deductions on R&amp;D Tax Credits Adjusted</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While R&amp;D tax credits were enhanced for SMEs, some businesses—especially larger corporations—saw a <strong>reduction in the rate of R&amp;D credits</strong> they can claim. This could deter innovation spending for some mid-sized companies and larger entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Our advice: If your business relies on R&amp;D credits, it’s crucial to review your qualifying costs and ensure all claims are maximised. We’re here to help with efficient claiming processes and strategies for continuing innovation cost-effectively.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Higher Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) for Second Homeowners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From tomorrow, individuals purchasing additional properties, including second homes and buy-to-let investments, will face an increased <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/renting-dont-get-caught-stamp-duty/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"224\">Stamp Duty</a> Land Tax (SDLT) surcharge of 5%</strong>, up from the previous 3%. This increase will apply to both residential and commercial properties, raising the entry cost for those expanding their property portfolios. The higher rate is expected to impact investment decisions, potentially deterring some buyers from entering or expanding in the property market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Our advice: For second-home buyers and property investors, this increased SDLT rate makes it more essential to carefully evaluate potential property returns and long-term profitability. At Black and White Accounting, we’re here to help you explore tax-efficient strategies, review your property investment plans, and assess other ways to optimise returns in light of this change.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts: Proactive Planning is Essential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Budget 2024 brings both opportunities and challenges. While there are benefits in certain areas, the downsides—such as reduced allowances, frozen thresholds, and increased <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"164\">taxes for specific groups—make strategic planning</a> more important than ever. At Black and White Accounting, our team is dedicated to helping you navigate these changes, ensuring that you’re prepared and positioned to mitigate any negative impacts on your finances. As always the devil is in the detail and as we read more, we will provide a more detailed summary for you to review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a business owner, investor, or individual navigating these new tax and allowance adjustments, we’re here to provide clear guidance and actionable strategies.

      "content": "\n<p>The 2024 Budget is packed with substantial updates across tax rates, allowances, and reliefs. From a new income tax band to expanded allowances for sustainable investments, Labour has crafted changes that will affect both individuals and businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we’re here to break down these changes so that you’re equipped to navigate new opportunities and manage any challenges. Here’s our detailed look at what Budget 2024 means for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Personal Allowance and Income Tax Bands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour introduced key changes in <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/everything-you-need-to-know-about-domicile-and-residency-for-income-tax/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"63\">income tax</a> bands and thresholds to support low- and middle-income earners while increasing tax for higher earners:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personal Allowance Increase</strong>: The Personal Allowance—the amount you can earn before income tax kicks in—has been raised from <strong>£12,570 to £13,250</strong>. This change will increase take-home pay for many, easing the impact of rising living costs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher-Rate Threshold Raised</strong>: The higher-rate threshold has been lifted from <strong>£50,270 to £55,000</strong>, reducing the number of middle-income earners falling into the 40% tax band.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>New Additional Rate</strong>: A new <strong>45% tax rate</strong> has been introduced on earnings above <strong>£150,000</strong>, ensuring that high earners contribute more. This change shifts a larger share of the tax burden to those with higher incomes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: For those earning below the new higher-rate threshold, this increase could mean more net income. However, for higher earners, this additional 45% band necessitates proactive <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"163\">tax planning</a>. Our team can help you identify ways to optimise income and explore tax-efficient solutions to manage these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. National Insurance Contribution (NIC) Adjustments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes to National Insurance Contributions are designed to balance support for smaller employers with increased contributions from larger businesses:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduction for Small Businesses</strong>: Employers with fewer than 50 employees will receive a <strong>10% reduction in their NIC rate</strong> on Class 1 Employer NICs. This means lower costs for businesses looking to grow or hire, providing immediate financial relief.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increase for Larger Employers</strong>: Employers with over 50 employees will see their NIC rate rise by <strong>1.2% to 15%</strong>. This hike increases payroll costs, impacting workforce management for medium and large businesses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Green Jobs and Apprenticeship Incentives</strong>: Employers creating environmentally friendly roles or offering apprenticeships can claim an additional <strong>2% NIC reduction</strong> for these positions, supporting sustainable hiring and skill development.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Employment Allowance</strong>: The Employment Allowance, which reduces NIC liabilities, has doubled from <strong>£5,000 to £10,500</strong> for employers with NIC bills under £100,000. This adjustment will provide valuable relief for small businesses, freeing up funds for reinvestment and growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: These NIC changes will directly affect payroll planning. For small businesses, these adjustments can reduce staffing costs, while larger employers may face added financial strain. Our team can assist you with payroll structuring and budgeting to ensure efficient NIC planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Corporation Tax: Reliefs and Incentives for Sustainable and Small Business Investment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main <strong>Corporation Tax rate remains at 25%</strong>, but the Budget introduced targeted reliefs to encourage green investments and support SMEs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Green Investment Allowance</strong>: Businesses investing in renewable energy and sustainable technology can claim an <strong>additional 20% deduction</strong> on qualifying investments. This means lower taxable profits for businesses that prioritize eco-friendly upgrades.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Small Business Relief</strong>: SMEs with profits below <strong>£250,000</strong> can access a reduced effective Corporation Tax rate through this new relief. This aims to support smaller businesses by lightening the tax load on growth-focused profits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: For businesses considering green projects or expansion, these incentives can reduce tax liabilities. Contact us for help in identifying qualifying investments and making the most of Corporation Tax savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Reduction in Annual Exempt Amount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) annual exempt amount</strong> has been reduced from <strong>£6,000 to £3,000</strong>. This substantial cut means that individuals will pay CGT on a larger portion of their capital gains from investments, property sales, and other asset disposals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: An investor selling shares with a gain of £10,000 previously enjoyed a £6,000 exemption, leaving £4,000 subject to CGT. Now, with the £3,000 exemption, £7,000 will be taxable, increasing the CGT owed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: For property owners and investors, this change will mean more of their gains are taxable. Planning asset sales strategically is essential to minimise CGT. We can support you with tax-efficient solutions to reduce exposure to CGT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) Increase for Additional Properties</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For property investors and second-home buyers, Labour has increased the <strong>SDLT surcharge on additional properties from 3% to 5%</strong>. This surcharge applies to both residential and commercial property purchases and raises upfront costs for those seeking to expand their portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: A landlord purchasing a buy-to-let property for £300,000 will now face a 5% SDLT surcharge, equating to £15,000, up from the previous £9,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: This SDLT increase will make property investments more costly, particularly for buy-to-let investors. For those considering expansion, we recommend reviewing the timing and structuring of property purchases. Our experts can help you navigate SDLT rules and minimise tax impact on your investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Enhanced R&amp;D Tax Credits for Innovation-Focused SMEs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Budget has enhanced <strong>Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) tax credits</strong> for SMEs, increasing relief to support innovation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Eligible SMEs can now claim <strong>up to 25% of qualifying R&amp;D expenses</strong>, a boost from the previous 13%. This move is targeted at industries driving technological advancements, particularly in sectors like healthcare, technology, and sustainability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: A tech firm spending £100,000 on R&amp;D could previously claim £13,000 in tax credits. With the new rate, this claim increases to £25,000, easing the financial burden of innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: For innovative SMEs, these credits provide a valuable tax-saving opportunity. We can help you navigate the claim process and maximise R&amp;D benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Pension Lifetime Allowance Reduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Pension Lifetime Allowance has been reduced from over £1 million to £900,000</strong>. This reduction means that high earners nearing retirement may reach this cap sooner, and any additional contributions above the threshold will incur tax penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: An executive with a £850,000 pension fund may now hit the £900,000 threshold faster, limiting further tax-efficient contributions and potentially incurring extra tax charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: If you’re close to this allowance, we recommend a review of your retirement plan. We can help you explore alternative savings vehicles and optimise your pension contributions to reduce tax exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Zero VAT on Energy-Saving Products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To encourage sustainable upgrades, VAT on energy-saving products like solar panels, insulation, and heat pumps has been <strong>reduced to 0%</strong> (down from 5%). This update makes eco-friendly improvements more accessible and affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: A business installing £20,000 worth of solar panels will save £1,000 in VAT due to the reduction, making sustainable investments more financially attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: This VAT relief provides an ideal time to consider green upgrades. We’re here to guide you through qualifying products and potential savings opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Reduced Dividend Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>tax-free dividend allowance has been halved to £500</strong> (from £1,000). This reduction means more dividend income will now be taxable, impacting business owners, investors, and anyone who relies on dividends for income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: A small business owner drawing £10,000 annually in dividends will now pay tax on £9,500, up from £9,000 previously, due to the reduced allowance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: We recommend reviewing dividend strategies and exploring other income structures to manage this additional tax impact effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Cost-of-Living Reliefs: Childcare Support and Energy Price Cap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To support families facing high living costs, Budget 2024 introduced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>£1,500 additional childcare tax credits</strong> annually for families earning under £50,000, easing childcare costs for working parents.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>two-year energy price cap</strong>, providing stability for households as energy prices fluctuate, with rebates applied directly through utility providers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: A family with two children in nursery and an income under £50,000 will see an additional £1,500 in childcare support, providing more disposable income for other expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: These changes can offer immediate relief to families. We can help integrate these benefits into your financial plan to optimise household budgeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Inheritance Tax (IHT) Threshold Freeze</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Inheritance Tax (IHT) nil-rate band remains frozen at £325,000</strong> for an additional two years, while the <strong>residence nil-rate band stays at £175,000</strong>. With rising property values, this freeze increases the likelihood of estates becoming liable for IHT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example</em>: A property valued at £500,000 may see a significant portion subject to IHT if the threshold remains static, emphasising the need for estate planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Impact</em>: For families, effective estate planning can help reduce potential IHT burdens. Our team can help explore options such as trusts, gifting, and strategic asset management to protect family wealth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts: Maximise Your Opportunities With Black and White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Budget 2024 brings numerous updates, from tax rate changes and new allowances to reduced exemptions.

      "content": "\n<p>One of the biggest hurdles for entrepreneurs and business owners is securing the right funding to turn dreams into reality. Whether you&#8217;re just starting out or looking to scale, understanding the funding options available can unlock the resources you need to grow your business. But with so many funding avenues out there, where should you start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a UK accountancy practice supporting individuals and businesses, we’re here to guide you through the process. In this blog, we’ll explore the various ways you can secure funding for your business, from traditional loans to modern alternatives like crowdfunding. Let’s dive in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Start with Self-Funding (Bootstrapping)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-funding, also known as bootstrapping, involves using your personal savings or assets to fund your business. This method allows you to maintain full control over your business and avoid debt or giving away equity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Full Control</strong>: You don’t have to answer to investors or lenders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Debt</strong>: Avoid loan repayments or interest fees.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Risk of Personal Loss</strong>: Using personal funds can be risky if your business faces financial challenges.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Growth Potential</strong>: Without external funding, scaling your business might take longer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Ensure you have a personal financial safety net in place before dipping into savings.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Government Grants and Loans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government offers various grants and loans to support <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-start-a-business-in-the-uk-a-guide-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"15\">entrepreneurs and small businesses</a>. These funds are designed to promote innovation, job creation, and economic growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Popular Government Funding Options:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start-Up Loans</strong>: A government-backed personal loan that provides funding up to £25,000 with a fixed interest rate and 1-5 years to repay. It also includes 12 months of free mentoring.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Innovate UK Grants</strong>: Supports businesses in research and innovation, particularly in technology, energy, and sustainability sectors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)</strong>: LEPs offer localised funding, grants, and support tailored to the needs of businesses in specific regions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Equity Loss</strong>: Grants don’t require giving up ownership of your business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Low-Interest Rates</strong>: Government loans typically offer favourable interest rates and repayment terms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Competition</strong>: Securing grants is highly competitive, with strict eligibility criteria.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Time-Consuming Applications</strong>: The application process can be lengthy and complex.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Seek professional advice to ensure you meet eligibility requirements and maximise your chances of success when applying for grants or loans.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Bank Loans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional bank loans remain one of the most popular ways for established businesses to raise capital. Banks offer a variety of business loans, including secured and unsecured loans, overdraft facilities, and lines of credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexible Terms</strong>: You can choose loans that fit your repayment ability and cash flow needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retain Full Ownership</strong>: Unlike equity financing, you don’t give up control of your business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Collateral Required</strong>: Secured loans may require personal or business assets as collateral.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Repayment Pressure</strong>: Regardless of your business performance, loan repayments must be made.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Create a detailed business plan and forecast your cash flow before approaching a bank. This shows lenders you have a solid plan to repay the loan.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Venture Capital (VC) Funding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses with high growth potential, especially in technology or innovation, venture capital is an option. Venture capitalists (VCs) invest in exchange for equity, bringing not just money but often mentorship and industry connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Significant Funding</strong>: VCs can provide large sums of capital to fuel rapid growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Expertise</strong>: VCs offer business guidance, industry insights, and networking opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Equity Loss</strong>: You give up part of your business in exchange for funding.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investor Influence</strong>: VCs will want a say in how your business is run, which may limit your autonomy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Approach venture capitalists who specialise in your industry. Focus on pitching your business’s scalability, innovation, and long-term growth potential.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Crowdfunding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crowdfunding has gained popularity as a way to raise money online from a large number of people, often through platforms like <strong>Kickstarter</strong> or <strong>Crowdcube</strong>. It’s especially effective for businesses with an innovative product or service that can attract public interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reward-Based</strong>: Backers receive a product, service, or other rewards for their contributions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Equity Crowdfunding</strong>: Investors receive a share of your business in exchange for their investment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Debt Crowdfunding</strong>: Backers loan money to your business with the expectation of repayment with interest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Market Validation</strong>: Successful campaigns prove there is demand for your product or service.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Access to a Large Audience</strong>: Crowdfunding platforms give you access to a global pool of potential investors or customers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Time-Consuming</strong>: Running a successful crowdfunding campaign requires significant marketing effort.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Guarantees</strong>: If you don’t reach your funding target, you may not receive any money.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Build a strong campaign with a compelling story, attractive rewards, and shareable content. Engage with your backers regularly to maintain momentum.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Angel Investors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Angel investors are wealthy individuals who provide capital in exchange for equity. Unlike venture capitalists, angel investors usually invest in earlier stages and are more hands-off in the day-to-day operations of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexible Investment</strong>: Angels often provide more flexibility than banks or venture capitalists.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Industry Connections</strong>: Many angel investors have deep networks that can benefit your business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Equity Dilution</strong>: You will need to give up a portion of your ownership in exchange for the investment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Involvement</strong>: Angels may not provide as much strategic support as VCs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Target angel investors who are passionate about your industry. They’re more likely to support your long-term vision and offer valuable connections.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Business Credit Cards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business credit cards offer a quick and flexible way to cover short-term expenses and manage cash flow. Many cards come with rewards, cashback, or interest-free periods, making them attractive for everyday purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Immediate Access to Funds</strong>: Easy to use for day-to-day business expenses without lengthy applications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rewards</strong>: Earn cashback, points, or travel rewards with your purchases.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High-Interest Rates</strong>: If balances aren’t paid off quickly, interest rates can accumulate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Borrowing Capacity</strong>: Credit limits may not provide enough capital for larger investments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Use business credit cards responsibly by paying off balances each month. This helps avoid interest charges and build your business’s credit score.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Friends and Family Funding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many entrepreneurs turn to their friends and family for financial support when starting or growing their businesses. This can be an informal loan or an equity stake in the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexible Terms</strong>: Friends and family are likely to offer more lenient repayment terms or lower interest rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trust</strong>: Personal relationships may make it easier to secure funding without a formal application process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personal Risk</strong>: Mixing business with personal relationships can lead to tension or conflict if the business struggles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Resources</strong>: The amount you can raise from friends and family may be limited compared to other funding sources.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Treat friends and family investments as seriously as you would a formal loan. Create a clear agreement outlining repayment terms or equity percentages to avoid misunderstandings.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Choose the Right Funding for Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting funding for your business doesn’t have to be overwhelming.

      "content": "\n<p>In today’s fast-paced, ever-evolving world, businesses must continually innovate to stay ahead. For those who embrace it, <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> offers a massive opportunity to transform operations, boost efficiency, and unlock new growth avenues. As a <strong>dynamic, fast-growing accountancy firm</strong>, we’re not just passionate about crunching numbers—we&#8217;re obsessed with helping our clients harness the power of AI to thrive in the digital age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the big question is: <strong>Are you leveraging AI in your business?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The AI Advantage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve likely heard the buzz around AI, but how can it make a tangible difference to your business?

With AI-powered automation tools, time-consuming processes like bookkeeping, payroll, and expense tracking become seamless and error-free.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better Decision-Making</strong><br>AI can analyse vast amounts of data in minutes, providing insights and trends that human eyes might miss. This enables business owners to make <strong>data-driven decisions</strong>, predict future market movements, and adapt strategies accordingly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced Customer Experiences</strong><br>AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can revolutionise how you engage with clients. These tools provide real-time, 24/7 responses to customer inquiries, improving satisfaction and freeing up your team to focus on more complex client needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Risk Management and Compliance</strong><br>Staying on top of regulatory requirements and managing financial risk can be a challenge. AI can help by monitoring transactions, flagging unusual activities, and ensuring compliance with ever-changing regulations. For businesses working in complex industries like <strong>cryptocurrency or property</strong>, AI&#8217;s predictive models can be invaluable in mitigating risk.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can You Start Leveraging AI?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you might be thinking: <em>“AI sounds great, but where do I start?”</em> The good news is you don’t need a PhD in computer science to implement AI in your business.

Begin with smaller, manageable projects that show quick wins—like automating payroll or using AI for predictive financial modeling. Once you see the value, scaling AI across your business becomes a natural next step.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing Support</strong><br>AI isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it solution. Regularly reviewing and optimising your AI processes is key to staying ahead. With <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we’ll be by your side, helping you leverage the latest AI advancements and ensuring your business benefits every step of the way.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future-Proof Your Business Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a world where change is the only constant, businesses that embrace AI will thrive while others struggle to keep up.

      "content": "\n<p>As tax efficiency and wealth preservation become top priorities for many families, the <strong>Family Investment Company (FIC)</strong> has emerged as a powerful tool to manage and pass on wealth. But is it the right choice for you? Whether you’re a high-net-worth individual or looking for a way to protect your family’s assets, a FIC could offer a compelling alternative to traditional trust structures or personal investments. In this blog, we’ll dive into the ins and outs of Family Investment Companies and help you decide if it’s the right strategy for your financial goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Family Investment Company (FIC)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Family Investment Company</strong> is a private limited company set up to hold and manage family wealth. The main purpose of a FIC is to allow wealth to grow within a tax-efficient corporate environment, where family members are the shareholders. It can invest in a variety of assets, such as property, shares, or investment funds, while also offering more control and flexibility over how wealth is passed down to future generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is typically <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">structured</a> to ensure the founders (often parents or grandparents) retain control while future generations (such as children or grandchildren) benefit from the assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does a FIC Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a FIC involves establishing a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/case-study-dealing-with-a-limited-companys-accounting-nightmare/\">limited company</a> and transferring assets (often cash) into the company. The founders usually subscribe for <strong>different classes of shares</strong>, giving them control over voting rights, dividend distributions, and asset allocation. Family members can hold shares with limited or no voting rights, ensuring wealth is passed down without ceding control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexibility in Control</strong>: You can decide who holds voting rights and who benefits from dividends.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-Efficient Growth</strong>: Investments made by the FIC grow in a tax-efficient corporate environment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wealth Transfer</strong>: Provides a clear and structured way to transfer wealth to younger generations without handing over full control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros of a Family Investment Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax Efficiency</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One of the main attractions of a FIC is the potential to <strong>reduce <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/inheritance-tax/\">inheritance tax</a> (IHT)</strong> liabilities. By transferring assets to the FIC early on, growth on these assets is outside the founder’s estate for IHT purposes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a> Rates</strong>: Investments held within a FIC are subject to corporation tax on gains and income (currently 25%), which is often lower than personal tax rates on income and capital gains.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividends</strong>: Shareholders can receive dividends, which may benefit from lower <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/individuals-and-personal-tax/\">personal tax</a> rates, especially for family members in lower tax brackets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control &amp; Flexibility</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Founders can <strong>retain control</strong> through voting shares, while future generations hold non-voting shares. This means wealth can be transferred without giving away management power.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can set rules for how and when dividends are distributed to ensure younger generations don&#8217;t access large sums prematurely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protection from Family Disputes</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Shareholder agreements can be drawn up to avoid potential conflicts. Clear guidelines about share transfers, voting rights, and dividend policies can prevent family disagreements in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoiding Trust Complications</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>FICs can be an appealing alternative to family trusts, which have become less attractive due to changes in tax rules. FICs allow you to avoid the <strong>periodic and exit charges</strong> that apply to discretionary trusts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cons of a Family Investment Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complex Setup and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-administrative-and-pa-services-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Administration</a></strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Setting up a FIC requires detailed planning, legal advice, and the creation of multiple classes of shares. <strong>Ongoing compliance</strong> with company law, annual filings, and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">accounting</a> can add administrative burden.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Costs</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Professional fees for setting up a FIC can be significant, including legal, tax, and accounting costs. Additionally, <strong>annual running costs</strong> can add up, especially if the FIC holds diverse assets that require regular management.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/reduce-corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a> on Gains</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/rd-tax-credits-corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a> rate may be lower than personal tax rates, <strong>capital gains realised within the FIC</strong> will be subject to corporation tax. Additionally, when dividends are distributed, family members will need to pay <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">income tax</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Access to Funds</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Once assets are transferred to the FIC, they are no longer the personal property of the founder. While you can access dividends, accessing capital could trigger additional <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/made-redundant-tax-implications/\">tax implications</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is a FIC Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A FIC is particularly suited for high-net-worth individuals or families looking to pass on wealth in a structured and tax-efficient way. It’s a powerful tool for <strong>long-term wealth management</strong>, especially if you want to retain control while allowing your assets to grow within a corporate framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some scenarios where a FIC might be the right choice:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>You want to protect family wealth</strong>: If you’re concerned about future <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-capital-gains-and-inheritance-tax-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">inheritance tax</a> liabilities and want to protect wealth for future generations, a FIC could help reduce IHT exposure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You need flexibility and control</strong>: If you want to transfer wealth to your children or grandchildren but retain control over how and when they access it, a FIC’s share structure allows you to do this effectively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your investments are substantial</strong>: If you have a large investment portfolio or business assets, the corporate <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/capital-gains-tax-changes-coming-6th-april-2020/\">tax rates applied to capital gains</a> and income within a FIC might offer more tax efficiency compared to holding them personally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have a smaller portfolio or don&#8217;t require significant control over the distribution of wealth, alternative options like <strong>trusts, ISAs, or even a personal investment portfolio</strong> might be simpler and potentially more cost-effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Family Investment Company</strong> can be a game-changer for families looking to safeguard and grow their wealth for future generations. With its potential for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-efficient-investments/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"88\">tax-efficient investment</a> growth and the ability to retain control over family assets, it’s an attractive option for high-net-worth individuals.

      "content": "\n<p>So, you’re about to launch your business in the UK, and now you’ve hit one of the most exciting (and daunting) parts—what on earth should you name your limited company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name you choose will represent your brand, your business&#8217;s values, and might be the first impression you make on clients. Plus, it’s something you’ll have to love (and stick with) for a long time. But before you let your creativity run wild, there are some important rules to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fun Bit: Get Creative!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by brainstorming ideas that align with your business’s mission, services, or values. Do you want your name to sound professional and sleek, quirky and creative, or maybe something with a bit of local flair? Here’s some inspiration:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Descriptive Names</strong>: “Tech Titans Ltd” for a tech-based business or “Urban Blooms Ltd” for a city-based florist.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Founders&#8217; Names</strong>: Many businesses opt for the personal touch, such as “Smith &amp; Jones Consulting Ltd.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wordplay and Puns</strong>: If you’re in a fun industry, why not inject humour? Think “Bean There Ltd” for a coffee company or “Shear Brilliance Ltd” for a hair salon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Not-So-Fun Rules You’ll Need to Follow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start printing business cards, make sure your name complies with Companies House regulations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unique Name</strong>: Your name must be original—no duplicates! If there’s already a “Happy Homes Ltd,” you’ll have to rethink. You can search Companies House’s online database to check availability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid Sensitive Words</strong>: Certain words like “Royal,” “British,” or “Bank” require permission to use. If you’ve got grand plans for “Royal Innovations Ltd,” you might want to reconsider unless you have permission.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Offensive Words</strong>: This might seem obvious, but no inappropriate or offensive words are allowed. Keep it clean and professional!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ending with ‘Ltd’</strong>: Your business name must include either “Limited” or “Ltd” to show it’s a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/case-study-dealing-with-a-limited-companys-accounting-nightmare/\">limited company</a>. No shortcuts here!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Misleading Names</strong>: You can’t choose a name that implies a connection with the government, a public body, or professions you aren’t licensed for (sorry, “Health Solutions Ltd” isn’t allowed unless you’re in the health <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sectors/\">sector</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quick Tips to Help You Decide:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Think Future-Proof</strong>: As your business grows, will the name still fit? A name that sounds too niche now might limit your appeal down the road.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep It Simple</strong>: Something that’s easy to spell and pronounce will <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">save</a> you (and your customers) a lot of frustration!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check for Trademarks</strong>: Ensure no one else holds a trademark for the name you’ve fallen in love with.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where do I need to display the limited company name?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-setup-a-limited-company/\">limited company</a> must display its registered company name in several places, both publicly and in official communications. The law is clear about where and how the company name must appear to ensure transparency and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">accountability</a>. Here are the key places where a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-close-a-limited-company/\">limited company</a> name must be shown:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Registered Office and Business Premises</strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The company’s full registered name (including &#8220;Ltd&#8221; or &#8220;Limited&#8221;) must be prominently displayed at the registered office address and any other location where it operates. This requirement applies even if the location is a residential address.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The name must be visible to the public (e.g., a sign at the front of the building). However, this rule does not apply to purely residential addresses unless business activities are conducted there.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company Website</strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your company has a website, the registered company name must be shown on the site.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other details that must be displayed include the company’s registered number, the place of registration (e.g., &#8220;Registered in England and Wales&#8221;) and the company’s registered office address.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This information is typically included in the website’s footer or in a &#8220;Legal&#8221; or &#8220;About Us&#8221; section.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business Documents</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The registered company name must appear on all significant business documents, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Letters and emails</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Invoices</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Receipts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Purchase orders</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contracts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Notices and official correspondence</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cheques and other financial instruments</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Communications with HMRC</strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any official communication with HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs), such as <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">tax returns</a>, PAYE forms, VAT registration, and payments, must also include the company’s full registered name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company Seal</strong> (if applicable):</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the company uses a seal (though it&#8217;s not legally required), the seal must include the company’s full name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stationery and Marketing Materials</strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While it’s not legally mandatory to show the full registered name on brochures or advertisements, it’s a good practice. However, all business letters (including emails) must have the registered name included.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social Media Profiles</strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Although not legally required, including the registered company name in social media profiles (especially those used for business) ensures clarity and can help with brand consistency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vehicles</strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If company <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vehicles/\">vehicles</a> are used for business, while it’s not a legal requirement, displaying the registered company name is common for branding purposes. However, for registered transport businesses (like those in haulage), specific regulations might apply.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">Forms and Filing with Companies House</a></strong>:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/companies-house-forms/\">forms or filings submitted to Companies House</a> (such as annual returns or confirmation statements) must display the registered company name.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that the registered company name appears in these places helps your company comply with legal requirements and builds transparency with customers and partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unhappy with the limited company name?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst naming your company can be an exciting time, please also don’t be overwhelmed by it. If you later don’t like it, there are options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Trading names: your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/should-i-incorporate-my-business-into-a-limited-company/\">limited company</a> can have multiple “trading names” (see our blog about this) to brand itself differently to different customers, or as your business evolves, rather than forming separate companies for each. This could give you more options.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Change the name: if as your business evolves the registered name no longer reflects the company’s mission, services and values, this can always be changed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need Help With Your Startup?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Naming your company is just one step of the exciting journey to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/building-business-resilience/\">building a business</a>. Whether you’re a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/startup-calculator/\">startup</a>, scaling rapidly, or have been around for years, our accountancy firm specializes in supporting businesses at every stage of growth.

      "content": "\n<p>You’ve worked hard to build a successful business, and after years of growth, everything’s suddenly… stuck. If your mature business has hit a plateau, you’re not alone. Many companies experience periods of stagnation, where growth stalls, innovation slows, and motivation dips. But don’t worry, stagnation doesn’t mean the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"162\">end of the road—it’s an opportunity</a> to take a fresh look at your business and explore your next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As specialists in supporting businesses at every stage—whether you’re just starting out, scaling quickly, or managing a mature business—our team is here to guide you through this period. So, what’s next for your business?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does &#8220;Stagnation&#8221; Mean for a Business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the business world, stagnation typically refers to a period of slow or zero growth. You’re no longer gaining new customers, expanding market share, or increasing profits. Operations may feel repetitive, with fewer innovative ideas coming through. While things aren’t necessarily going downhill, they’re certainly not moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now’s the time to re-energise your business strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Options for Next Steps:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Invest in Innovation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Stagnation is often a sign that your business needs something new. Look at areas where you can introduce innovation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product or Service Expansion: Could you diversify your offerings or enter new markets? Perhaps it’s time to offer complementary products or expand your services to meet emerging customer needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology Investment: Consider upgrading technology or automation to streamline operations and open up new possibilities. Embracing digital tools can enhance efficiency and attract tech-savvy customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recruitment and Upskilling</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your team might hold the key to unlocking your next phase of growth:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring in New Talent: Sometimes, fresh ideas and perspectives are what’s needed to drive change. Recruiting new leadership or specialist talent could inject energy and creativity into the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upskill Existing Staff: Invest in the development of your current team. Upskilling in areas like digital marketing, data analysis, or customer experience could help reignite momentum and boost productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seek Investment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If cash flow is slowing down and growth opportunities feel out of reach, it might be time to bring in investment:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Private Equity or Venture Capital</strong>: Bringing in investors can provide the capital you need to accelerate growth and innovation. However, be prepared to share control or equity in return for funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Debt Financing</strong>: A business loan or line of credit could give you the financial resources needed to fund expansion or pivot into a new market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consider Exit Planning</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stagnation can be a signal that it’s time to start planning for the future of your business:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-prepare-your-business-for-sale/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"111\">Business Sale</a></strong>: If you feel like you’ve taken the business as far as you can, selling could allow you to realise the value you’ve built and pass it on to someone who can take it to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Succession Planning</strong>: If you’re considering retirement or stepping back, this could be the moment to groom a successor, ensuring the business continues to thrive under new leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do Nothing (For Now)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, patience is key. If the broader economy is affecting your growth, you might choose to ride out the storm and focus on maintaining stability. Ensure your cash flow remains steady, optimise operational efficiency, and be ready to act when the right opportunity presents itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where to Start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a step back and assess your business. Start by asking yourself:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What’s causing the stagnation? Is it external market factors, internal inefficiencies, or a lack of fresh ideas?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are there areas of untapped potential? Could your team, product, or processes be improved?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What’s my vision for the future? Do you want to grow, diversify, or prepare for an exit?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful Information:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Look at the Data</strong>: Use financial analysis and customer insights to identify areas for growth or improvement. Are there new trends in your market? Is your target audience evolving?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Talk to Experts</strong>: Get professional advice from accountants, business consultants, or advisors. We can help identify gaps in your strategy and offer tailored solutions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benchmark Against Competitors</strong>: How are similar businesses navigating the market? Look at industry leaders for inspiration and take note of what they’re doing differently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: What’s Next for Your Business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stagnation doesn’t mean failure—it’s a natural part of the business cycle. Whether you choose to innovate, recruit, seek investment, or prepare for an exit, this could be your business’s next great chapter. As accountants who work closely with UK startups, fast-growing, and mature businesses, we’re here to help you evaluate your options, optimise your finances, and move forward with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling stuck?

      "content": "\n<p>Being appointed as a <strong>director of a company</strong> is a significant role, carrying a host of responsibilities, but what if you’re a director without owning any shares in the company? Can you still influence decisions? What rights do you hold, and what are your legal responsibilities? And what is the difference between a director and a shareholder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a></strong>, we work with directors and business owners every day, helping them understand the complexities of their roles and the legal implications of directorship. In this blog, we’ll explore what it <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/im-a-shareholder-but-not-a-director-what-does-that-mean-for-my-rights-and-responsibilities/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"112\">means to be a <strong>director but not a shareholder</strong></a>, and how you can navigate your rights, responsibilities, and influence within the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a Director?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>director</strong> is appointed by a company to oversee its operations and make strategic decisions. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/statutory-duties-of-a-director-of-a-limited-company/\">Directors have legal duties to the company</a> and its shareholders, and they are responsible for ensuring that the company complies with laws and operates effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many cases, directors are also shareholders—meaning they own part of the company and have a financial stake in its success. However, it’s entirely possible to be a <strong>director without holding any shares</strong> in the business. This creates a unique situation where your responsibilities may not align with your financial interests, but it’s a common arrangement in larger companies, charities, subsidiaries of bigger <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/clubs-and-societies/\">organisations</a>, or potentially family businesses for non-family members.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Rights as a Director (Without Being a Shareholder)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While directors have specific powers and responsibilities, their rights are very different from those of <strong>shareholders</strong>. Here’s what you can expect as a director without a stake in the company:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Decision-Making Power</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director, you are typically involved in <strong>day-to-day decision-making</strong> and the strategic direction of the company. This includes making choices about operations, investments, hiring, and the overall <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-plan-2021/\">business plan</a>. Your role is to guide the company to success, but your decision-making power is <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/case-study-dealing-with-a-limited-companys-accounting-nightmare/\">limited to what the company’s</a> constitution or board has outlined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, shareholders generally have the final say on significant company decisions. For example, matters like issuing new shares, amending the company’s articles of association, or approving substantial mergers require <strong>shareholder approval</strong>. As a non-shareholding director, you may not have a vote on these matters unless explicitly granted by the shareholders or board.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Right to Attend Board Meetings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director, you will have the right to attend and participate in <strong>board meetings</strong> where company policies and strategic decisions are discussed. While shareholders may vote on major company changes, directors are responsible for managing the company’s affairs on a day-to-day basis, and these meetings are where those discussions happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Access to Company Information</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors have a legal right to access <strong>company information</strong>, including financial statements, performance reports, and any other data necessary to fulfil their duties. Even if you don’t own shares, your position as a director entitles you to stay informed about the company’s financial health and operational standing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Influence Over Operations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without a financial stake, as a director, you’ll have considerable <strong>influence</strong> over the company’s operations, depending on your role. You may be responsible for overseeing key <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/manage-business-finances-christmas/\">business functions such as finance</a>, marketing, HR, or technology. Your expertise and strategic guidance can be critical to the company’s success, and shareholders often rely on directors’ insights to grow the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Responsibilities as a Director</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a shareholder or not, as a director, you are bound by legal obligations to act in the best interests of the company. These responsibilities come with serious consequences if not adhered to, so it’s vital to fully understand them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are your key responsibilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Fiduciary Duty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors have a <strong>fiduciary duty</strong> to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. This means putting the company’s success ahead of personal interests, even if you don’t own shares. Decisions you make should be driven by what’s best for the business, rather than personal gain or outside influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Duty to Promote the Success of the Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are legally required to act in a way that promotes the success of the company for the benefit of its members (shareholders). Even if you don’t own shares, your primary goal is to increase value for those who do. This can mean taking actions that drive profitability, ensuring compliance with laws, or maintaining a strong reputation in the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Compliance with the Law</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors are responsible for ensuring that the company complies with <strong>UK laws and regulations</strong>, including filing accurate financial accounts, paying taxes, and adhering to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/five-employment-law-changes-coming-in-april-2021/\">employment and health and safety laws</a>. Failure to comply can lead to legal and financial penalties for both the company and directors personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a shareholder, you must avoid any <strong>conflict of interest</strong> between your role as a director and any personal or professional relationships outside the company. You’re required to disclose any potential conflicts and must not use your position to benefit yourself or others at the company’s expense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Ensuring Financial Responsibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director, you are partly responsible for the <strong>financial health</strong> of the company. You must ensure that the company maintains proper financial records, is solvent, and that any decisions made do not put the company at undue risk. If the company becomes insolvent, you could be held liable if you continue to trade and increase debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Don’t Have as a Non-Shareholding Director</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to understand what you <strong>don’t have</strong> as a director who is not also a shareholder:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Ownership</strong>: You don’t own any part of the company, meaning you won’t benefit from dividends or capital growth unless shares are later granted to you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Voting Rights on Shareholder Matters</strong>: You won’t have a vote on issues that shareholders decide, such as the election of directors, approval of dividends, or changes to the company’s constitution.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Share of Profits</strong>: Unless you negotiate shares or bonuses into your director&#8217;s agreement, you won’t receive a share of the company’s profits. Your compensation may come from salary or other agreed-upon perks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Still Have Influence?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may not have the direct financial interest of a shareholder, your role as a director still carries significant weight. Here’s how you can leverage your position:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Establish Strong Relationships with Shareholders</strong> Building trust with shareholders can strengthen your position as a director. If they see you’re acting in the company’s best interests, they may be more likely to consult with you on important matters or take your advice on strategic decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be a Key Contributor</strong> Your expertise and insight can be invaluable to the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/essential-tips-to-supercharge-your-small-business-success/\">business’s success</a>. By consistently contributing to the company’s growth and stability, you may be able to <strong>negotiate compensation</strong> in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/downloadable-forms/\">form</a> of shares down the line.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on Performance</strong> Even without shares, your performance as a director impacts the company’s overall success. Focusing on delivering strong results and maintaining the company’s financial health is key to staying influential in your role.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: It’s a Balancing Act</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a director without being a shareholder may seem unusual, but it’s more common than you think. While you won’t benefit from dividends or direct ownership, you still hold considerable responsibility and influence over the company’s operations and strategy. Your focus should be on fulfilling your legal duties, promoting the success of the business, and navigating your relationship with shareholders to ensure alignment between the company’s goals and your responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we help directors understand their rights and responsibilities, ensuring they stay compliant with the law while driving business success. Whether you’re a shareholder or not, we can help you navigate the complexities of directorship with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s Talk:</strong> Are you a director without shares? <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">Contact us</a> today for expert advice on your role, your legal responsibilities, and how to protect your interests while driving the company forward.</p>\n",

AI can streamline the recruitment process by automating tasks such as resume screening, candidate assessment, and even initial interview scheduling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI-Powered HR Tools</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Resume Screening:</strong> AI-driven HR software can quickly screen resumes, matching candidates’ skills with job requirements, saving you time in the hiring process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employee Onboarding:</strong> AI chatbots can assist new hires with onboarding tasks, such as filling out forms, setting up email accounts, and answering common HR-related questions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How This Helps Your Business:</strong> AI tools simplify and accelerate HR processes, allowing you to focus on finding the best candidates and nurturing a positive workplace environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting Started with AI for Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting AI in your business doesn&#8217;t mean you need to overhaul everything overnight.

As a trusted UK-based accountancy firm, we specialise in helping startups get off the ground, and we&#8217;re here to share some essential tips to help you navigate the early stages of business creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Start a Business in The UK - 2025\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWze2sfW6B4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Develop Your Business Idea and Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to have a clear business idea and turn it into a solid <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/business-plan-2021/\">business plan</a>. You need to identify your target market, understand your competition, and determine how your product or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">service</a> will stand out. This will help you outline your goals and plan how you’ll achieve them. A strong business plan also shows potential investors and lenders that you’re serious about your venture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key components of a business plan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Executive summary</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Market analysis</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketing and sales strategies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Financial projections</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Funding requirements (if applicable)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Choose the Right Legal Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important decisions you&#8217;ll make is choosing the legal <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">structure</a> for your business. In the UK, you can register your business as one of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-a-sole-trader-your-guide-to-becoming-self-employed-and-what-it-means-for-you/\">Sole Trader</a></strong>: This is the simplest structure, where you&#8217;re personally responsible for your business&#8217;s debts and profits. It&#8217;s ideal for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">freelancers</a> or small, one-person businesses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/case-study-dealing-with-a-limited-companys-accounting-nightmare/\">Limited Company</a></strong>: A limited company is a separate legal entity from its owners, which means personal assets are protected. It’s more complex than being a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-register-as-a-sole-trader/\">sole trader</a> but offers tax advantages and credibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Partnership</strong>: If you&#8217;re starting a business with someone else, you may consider a partnership, where you and your partners share responsibility and profits. These can be traditional Partnerships (unincorporated) or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-liability-partnership-services/\">Limited Liability Partnerships</a> (LLPs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right structure has long-term implications, so consulting with an accountant at this stage is crucial. There are also other types of entity, but these tend to be not-for-profit <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/clubs-and-societies/\">organisations</a> like charities, clubs and community interest companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Register Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve chosen a legal structure, you&#8217;ll need to officially register your business. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">Sole traders</a></strong>: Register with HMRC for self-assessment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-setup-a-limited-company/\">Limited companies</a></strong>: Register your company with Companies House and submit annual accounts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: Register with HMRC, and make sure to set up a written partnership agreement to clarify roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing. LLPs also need to be registered with Companies House.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Understand Your Tax Responsibilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-evasion-vs-tax-avoidance/\">tax obligations is key to avoiding</a> surprises down the line. Depending on your business structure, you’ll need to handle the following taxes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/income-tax/\">Income Tax</a></strong>: If you&#8217;re a sole trader, your profits will be taxed as part of your personal income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">Corporation Tax</a></strong>: Limited companies must pay tax on their profits. The current rate is 19%, but it’s set to rise for higher profits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT</strong> (Value Added Tax): If your business’s turnover exceeds £85,000, you must <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/should-my-business-be-vat-registered/\">register for VAT</a>. Even if you’re under the threshold, voluntary VAT registration can offer advantages depending on your business model.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>PAYE</strong> (Pay As You Earn): If you hire employees, you’ll need to set up PAYE to collect income tax and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/national-insurance/\">National Insurance</a> from salaries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An accountant can ensure you’re compliant with tax laws and help you with tax planning to maximise <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">savings</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Set Up a Business Bank Account</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Separating your personal and business finances is essential for <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">bookkeeping</a>, legal, and tax purposes. If you&#8217;re operating as a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/limited-company-services/\">limited company</a> or LLP, it’s legally required to have a business bank account. Having a dedicated account will make it easier to track your income, manage expenses, and prepare for taxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Get Funding and Financial Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting a business often requires an initial investment, and the UK offers various funding options for startups, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Government grants</strong>: Certain industries or locations may be eligible for grants that don’t need to be repaid.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Startup loans</strong>: The UK government offers startup loans of up to £25,000, along with free mentoring.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Angel investors and venture capital</strong>: If you have a high-growth business, securing investment from angels or VCs may be a viable option.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A detailed financial forecast can help you identify how much capital you’ll need and where to find it. Personal savings, or support from friends and family are also potential <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-can-i-get-funding-for-my-business-your-guide-to-securing-financial-support/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"97\">sources of funding</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Comply with Regulations and Licenses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you’re aware of any industry-specific regulations or licenses that apply to your business. This could include health and safety regulations, environmental permits, or professional qualifications, depending on your field. Failing to comply could result in fines or legal issues down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Set Up Proper Accounting Systems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting your finances in order from the start is vital. Invest in an accounting system that allows you to track income, expenses, and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tips-for-managing-cashflow-for-smes/\">cash flow</a>. For <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/essential-tips-to-supercharge-your-small-business-success/\">small businesses</a>, cloud accounting software like Xero or QuickBooks can be incredibly helpful, offering automated invoicing, payroll, and tax filing. Working with an accountant will ensure that your financial records are accurate and compliant, freeing you up to focus on growing your business. Whilst it might not initially be required, the sooner you do this the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Market Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, getting the word out about your new venture is critical for success. Create a marketing strategy that aligns with your target audience and utilise both online and offline channels to reach them. This could include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Building a professional website;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using social media to promote your brand;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Networking with local business communities; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering promotions or referral incentives to attract customers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, your first few clients are often the hardest to find, so don’t hesitate to invest in marketing early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting Your Business With Confidence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting a business in the UK may seem overwhelming, but with the right plan and support, you can turn your vision into a reality. Whether you are a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/incorporation-making-the-move-from-sole-trader-to-director/\">sole trader or launching a limited company</a>, following these steps will set you on the path to success. As experienced accountants working with startups, we can help you navigate these crucial early stages and offer ongoing support to help your business thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to take the first step? <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">Contact us</a> today for expert advice tailored to your new business; let’s get your startup off the ground!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>In the race to embrace cutting-edge technology, AI is proving to be a game-changer for businesses across the UK. At Black and White Accounting, we’re passionate about helping our clients stay ahead of the curve and, as AI enters the scene in powerful ways, we’re here to ensure you’re prepared for both its potential and its pitfalls. So, what should you be watching out for as AI takes on an increasingly central role in business?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Understand Data Dependency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI thrives on data, and it’s no surprise that the more data a business has, the better its AI can perform. However, collecting and managing data comes with responsibility. In the UK, stringent data protection laws such as GDPR mean businesses must be vigilant in handling customer data. AI can revolutionise data insights, but it also means businesses must stay compliant to avoid hefty fines and reputation damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Recognise the Real Cost of AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can bring impressive efficiency gains, but it isn’t without cost. From expensive initial setup to ongoing maintenance, it’s essential to understand the financial commitment AI requires. Training AI models requires substantial computing power and skilled personnel—both of which can strain budgets. Plan your AI investment wisely, weighing initial costs against the potential for long-term ROI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Be Prepared for Cybersecurity Challenges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI’s abilities can serve both creators and cybercriminals. Phishing attacks, deepfake technology, and other AI-driven threats are growing concerns. To protect your business, incorporate AI-powered cybersecurity tools that detect threats proactively. It’s essential to keep your systems and staff well-versed in the latest cybersecurity protocols to minimise the risk of AI-enabled attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Guard Against AI Bias</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI may seem objective, but it’s only as unbiased as the data it learns from. If the data used to train an AI system contains bias—intentionally or not—the results could skew in ways that harm certain demographics or lead to unfair decision-making. Especially in roles impacting employment, lending, or customer <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">service</a>, businesses must invest in responsible AI training, carefully examining data for potential bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Don’t Lose the Human Touch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI offers automation and efficiency, but it’s essential not to let AI replace meaningful human interaction where it matters. For many clients, especially in finance and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">accounting</a>, personalised advice and human insight remain irreplaceable. While chatbots and automated responses can handle basic inquiries, ensure a human element is always available to handle more complex or sensitive client interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Keep an Eye on Legal Accountability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI gets smarter, legal questions around accountability are on the rise. Who’s responsible if AI makes an error or a biased decision? New regulations will likely continue to emerge as AI technology advances. Make sure your business stays up-to-date with relevant legislation, and consider whether you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-insurance-do-i-need-for-my-business/\">need new insurance</a> coverage or policies to address potential liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Prepare for Ethical Dilemmas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI raises ethical questions that businesses can’t afford to ignore. Surveillance, data collection, and the potential for AI to replace jobs all have societal impacts. For businesses, particularly fast-growing ones like ours, the challenge lies in embracing AI in ways that balance innovation with social responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Stay Agile and Embrace Continuous Learning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI technology is evolving at lightning speed. What’s innovative today might be outdated tomorrow. To harness AI effectively, stay informed of trends and advances, and encourage continuous learning within your team. With regular training and a flexible approach, your business can adapt to changes and turn AI challenges into opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI offers a world of possibilities for UK businesses, and with the right preparation, you can leverage it to grow and thrive. At <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a>, we’re committed to helping you navigate the complexities of AI in a way that aligns with your values and goals.

      "content": "\n<p>Buying a franchise can be a fantastic opportunity to run your own business with the backing of an established brand and proven business model. But just like any major investment, it’s essential to go in with your eyes wide open. The world of franchising offers tremendous potential, but it’s not without its challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\">Black and White Accounting</a></strong>, we help individuals and businesses navigate the world of franchising, providing expert financial advice and support to ensure your investment is a smart one. In this blog, we’ll cover everything you need to know before buying a franchise, from the pros and cons to the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/essential-tips-to-supercharge-your-small-business-success/\">essential tips</a> that can help you make the right choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Pros of Buying a Franchise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchising offers some distinct advantages over starting a business from scratch. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Proven Business Model</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy a franchise, you’re <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/start-up-accountant/\">investing in a tried-and-tested business</a><strong> model</strong>. The brand has already demonstrated that its products or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/services/\">services</a> resonate with customers, and the processes for delivering them are well-established. This significantly reduces the risk compared to starting a new, unproven business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Brand Recognition</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchisees benefit from <strong>instant brand recognition</strong>. Rather than spending years building a reputation, you’re able to leverage an established name that customers already trust. This can help you attract clients from day one, reducing the time it takes to build a loyal customer base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Ongoing Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of franchising is the <strong>support</strong> you receive from the franchisor. This can include training, marketing assistance, access to bulk purchasing power, and ongoing operational guidance. Essentially, you’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Marketing Power</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many franchise agreements come with access to <strong>national marketing campaigns</strong> that the franchisor runs. These campaigns help increase brand awareness and drive sales, without you having to bear the full cost of advertising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Financing Opportunities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because franchises are often viewed as safer investments, it may be easier to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/power-of-attorney/\">secure financing</a> from banks or investors. Many lenders are more willing to provide loans for well-known franchise brands due to the reduced risk associated with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Cons of Buying a Franchise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While franchising has many advantages, it’s not the right fit for everyone. Here are some potential downsides to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Initial Investment Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchises can come with significant <strong>upfront costs</strong>. You’ll <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/do-i-need-a-paye-scheme/\">need to pay</a> an initial franchise fee, and there may be additional expenses like equipment, premises, and inventory. Some franchise agreements also include ongoing royalty payments, which can eat into your profits which can make it harder for you to take money out of the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Limited Control</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy a franchise, you’re required to follow the franchisor’s guidelines, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/should-i-incorporate-my-business-into-a-limited-company/\">which can limit your ability to <strong>make decisions</strong></a> about certain aspects of the business. For example, you may have limited flexibility with pricing, products, or marketing strategies. If you’re someone who likes to innovate and have complete control, this could be a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Ongoing Fees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the initial investment, franchisees are often required to pay <strong>ongoing royalty fees</strong> to the franchisor, as well as contributions to a national marketing fund. These fees are typically based on a percentage of your sales, so even if your business is still growing, you’ll need to account for these ongoing expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Shared Reputation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your franchise’s success is tied to the overall <strong>brand reputation</strong>. While this is usually a positive, it can also be a risk. If other franchisees perform poorly or the brand faces bad publicity, it could affect your business through no fault of your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Buying a Franchise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’ve weighed the pros and cons, here are some essential tips to help you make the right decision when buying a franchise:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Do Your Research</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before committing to any franchise, <strong>research the industry, brand, and market</strong>. Talk to current and former franchisees to get a feel for the company’s culture, the level of support provided, and the day-to-day reality of running the franchise. Understanding the brand’s performance, customer base, and competitors will give you a clearer picture of what to expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Read the Franchise Agreement Carefully</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The franchise agreement outlines the terms and conditions of your relationship with the franchisor. This is a <strong>legally binding contract</strong>, so it’s crucial to read it carefully and understand every detail. Key elements to review include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Franchise fees</strong>: Upfront costs, royalties, and marketing contributions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Territory rights</strong>: Do you have exclusive rights to a specific area, or will other franchisees be allowed to operate nearby?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support and training</strong>: What level of ongoing support can you expect from the franchisor?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Renewal terms</strong>: How long is the franchise agreement, and what are the conditions for renewal?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consult with a legal and financial advisor, like the experts at <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Black and White</a> Accounting</strong>, to ensure you fully understand the financial and legal obligations involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Understand the Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the initial franchise fee, make sure you account for <strong>all the costs</strong> involved in running the business. This includes equipment, leasing a location, staffing, marketing, and supplies. You should also factor in working capital to cover operating expenses until your business becomes profitable. Having a clear financial plan is essential for success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Know Your Market</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before committing, conduct thorough <strong>market research</strong> to ensure there’s demand for the franchise in your chosen location. Does the area have the right demographic for your business? Are there competitors in the area that could affect your sales? A well-chosen location can be the difference between success and failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Look at the Franchisor’s Track Record</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong franchisor will have a proven track record of supporting its franchisees and helping them succeed. Look at the performance of other franchisees, particularly those in similar markets. Are they profitable? Do they feel supported? Has the brand seen consistent growth over time? When have they succeeded/failed and why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Have an Exit Strategy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re confident in your franchise investment, it’s important to think about your <strong>exit strategy</strong>. What happens if you decide to sell the franchise? Does the agreement allow you to sell it, and are there any conditions or restrictions? Understanding your exit options is essential for long-term planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Is Buying a Franchise Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a franchise offers an incredible opportunity to run your own business while leveraging the power of an established brand. But it’s essential to do your homework, understand the financial commitments, and ensure that the franchise you choose aligns with your goals and values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/jon-joins-black-white-accounting-team/\">Black and White Accounting</a></strong>, we’re here to help you navigate the complexities of franchising.

      "content": "\n<p>Making smart investments is key to growing your wealth, but what if you could maximize your returns while paying less tax? The UK offers a range of tax-efficient investment schemes designed to encourage savings and investment, allowing you to keep more of your hard-earned money. From ISAs to the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), understanding these options can help you build a strong financial future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a UK accountancy practice specialising in supporting individuals and businesses, we’ll walk you through the most popular tax-efficient investment opportunities and how you can make the most of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest and most accessible tax-efficient investments, the <strong>ISA</strong> allows UK residents to save and invest without paying tax on any income or capital gains. The key benefit of an ISA is that any interest, dividends, or capital gains generated within the account are completely <strong>tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>ISA Allowance</strong>: For the 2023/2024 tax year, the maximum ISA allowance is <strong>£20,000</strong>. You can spread this allowance across different types of ISAs, including:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cash ISAs</strong>: Ideal for risk-averse savers looking for a low-risk, tax-free interest account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stocks and Shares ISAs</strong>: For those willing to take on more risk in exchange for potentially higher returns, a stocks and shares ISA allows you to invest in the stock market with tax-free growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lifetime ISAs (LISAs)</strong>: Aimed at helping people save for their first home or retirement, the LISA offers a <strong>25% government bonus</strong> on contributions up to £4,000 per year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximising your ISA contributions each year is a powerful way to build a tax-efficient investment portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those looking to invest in high-growth, early-stage companies, the <strong>Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)</strong> offers significant tax advantages in exchange for higher risk. Designed to encourage investment in smaller, innovative businesses, EIS provides several attractive tax reliefs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Income Tax Relief</strong>: You can claim up to <strong>30% income tax relief</strong> on investments of up to £1 million per tax year, or £2 million if at least £1 million is invested in knowledge-intensive companies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Deferral</strong>: Any capital gains tax can be deferred if you reinvest the proceeds into an EIS-qualifying company.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-Free Gains</strong>: If you hold your EIS shares for at least three years and they grow in value, any profits made upon selling the shares are <strong>exempt from capital gains tax</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Loss Relief</strong>: If the company you invest in doesn’t succeed, you can offset the loss against your income tax bill.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The EIS is an excellent option for investors looking to diversify into more entrepreneurial ventures while taking advantage of generous tax reliefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS)</strong> is a sister program to EIS, but it focuses on even earlier-stage, smaller companies. SEIS offers even greater tax incentives to investors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Income Tax Relief</strong>: You can claim up to <strong>50% income tax relief</strong> on investments of up to £100,000 per tax year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capital Gains Tax Exemption</strong>: Gains from selling SEIS shares after holding them for three years are tax-free.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capital Gains Tax Reinvestment Relief</strong>: You can reduce any capital gains tax by reinvesting gains into SEIS-qualifying companies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While SEIS investments are inherently riskier than more established companies, the generous tax reliefs make them a compelling option for those willing to take a gamble on start-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs)</strong> allow you to invest in a portfolio of small, high-growth companies via a publicly listed trust. While slightly less risky than direct EIS or SEIS investments, VCTs still focus on small, unlisted companies and offer significant tax benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Income Tax Relief</strong>: You can claim <strong>30% income tax relief</strong> on investments of up to £200,000 per tax year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-Free Dividends</strong>: Dividends received from VCT shares are exempt from income tax, making this an attractive option for income-seeking investors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-Free Capital Gains</strong>: Any gains from selling VCT shares are also exempt from capital gains tax, provided you hold the shares for at least five years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>VCTs provide a way to invest in early-stage companies while benefiting from a more diversified, lower-risk portfolio than direct investment through EIS or SEIS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Pension Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pensions remain one of the most tax-efficient ways to save for the future. By contributing to a <strong>pension scheme</strong>, you can benefit from tax relief at your marginal tax rate, meaning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Basic-rate taxpayers</strong> receive 20% tax relief on contributions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher-rate taxpayers</strong> can claim 40% tax relief.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Additional-rate taxpayers</strong> can claim 45% tax relief.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This tax relief can make a significant difference in building a pension pot. Contributions are also exempt from income tax and capital gains tax while they grow within the pension fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, pensions offer potential <strong>inheritance tax benefits</strong>, as funds left in a pension can be passed on to beneficiaries without being subject to inheritance tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Other Tax-Efficient Strategies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to these schemes, there are other tax-efficient strategies you can use to maximise your investment returns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Allowance</strong>: Every individual has a <strong>CGT-free allowance</strong> (£6,000 for 2023/2024). By spreading the sale of investments across different tax years, you can reduce your CGT liability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividend Allowance</strong>: The first £1,000 of dividends you receive each year is tax-free, so consider using this allowance wisely when planning your investment withdrawals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Family <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"161\">Tax Planning</a></strong>: By using your spouse or partner’s tax allowances (such as their ISA or pension allowance), you can double up on tax-efficient savings strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: A Tax-Efficient Strategy is Key to Wealth Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding and using tax-efficient investments is crucial to growing your wealth while minimising the amount of tax you pay. Whether you&#8217;re maximising your ISA allowance, exploring high-growth opportunities with EIS and SEIS, or contributing to your pension, there are numerous ways to keep more of your money working for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need help with tax-efficient investment strategies?</strong> Contact us today for expert advice tailored to your financial goals.

      "content": "\n<p>For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), <strong>late payments</strong> can be more than just a financial headache—they can spell disaster. Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business, and when customers delay payments, the knock-on effects can be devastating: bills pile up, payroll becomes stressful, and growth opportunities are missed. That’s why we say “cash is king”. Unfortunately, late payments are a <strong>widespread issue</strong> for many UK SMEs, but there are steps you can take to tackle the problem and, critically, changes the government could implement to help protect businesses like yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we work with SMEs across the UK, and we know just how damaging late payments can be. In this blog, we’ll cover strategies to help you get paid on time, and what we think the government could do to tackle this growing crisis for UK businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Late Payments Such a Big Issue?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For SMEs, cash flow is everything. Unlike larger companies that may have reserves to fall back on, SMEs are often reliant on prompt payments to cover their own operating costs. According to recent statistics, <strong>50% of UK businesses</strong> experience late payments, and it’s estimated that around <strong>£23.4 billion</strong> is tied up in overdue invoices across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s why late payments can be so damaging:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cash Flow Strain</strong>: When your cash inflow is disrupted, it becomes harder to pay suppliers, employees, and even your tax bills on time;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Missed Growth Opportunities</strong>: Late payments can stop you from investing in opportunities to grow your business—whether that’s hiring new staff, expanding services, or marketing your offerings;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Borrowing Costs</strong>: Many SMEs turn to credit to cover gaps in their cash flow caused by late payments, leading to increased debt and higher interest costs; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stress and Uncertainty</strong>: Constantly chasing payments can lead to stress for business owners and a strained relationship with clients, further impacting long-term partnerships.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Can You Do to Combat Late Payments?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a business owner, you’re not powerless when it comes to late payments. Here are several strategies to help you get paid faster and maintain a healthy cash flow:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Clear Payment Terms from the Start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to ensure prompt payments is to set clear, concise payment terms from the outset. Make sure your payment terms are <strong>well-defined</strong> on every contract and invoice. This can include payment due dates, penalties for late payments, and any discounts for early payment. Shorter payment terms will also help you be paid sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Invoice Promptly and Regularly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sooner you send an invoice, the sooner you can get paid. Avoid delays in issuing invoices and ensure that they’re detailed and easy to understand. Automating your invoicing process through accounting software can help you issue invoices quickly and reduce errors that may cause payment delays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Follow Up on Overdue Payments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t be shy about chasing overdue payments. A polite yet firm follow-up email or phone call can remind clients of their obligations. You can even automate reminders through your accounting software to ensure follow-ups happen on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Incentivise Early Payments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider offering <strong>early payment discounts</strong> to encourage clients to pay before the due date. A small discount—say, 2% off if they pay within 7 days—can be enough to motivate clients to pay faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Enforce Late Payment Penalties</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduce late payment penalties in your terms and conditions. While it may feel awkward to enforce these, the threat of late fees can be a powerful motivator for customers to pay on time. It is a real cost to your business, so why not pass it onto your customers causing this?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Use Invoice Financing or Factoring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If late payments are crippling your business, you might consider <strong>invoice financing</strong> or <strong>factoring</strong>. These services allow you to sell your unpaid invoices to a third-party company at a discount, giving you immediate cash flow. While it involves a cost, it can help ease the cash flow strain when waiting on delayed payments. This can be a quick solution, but it needs to be a short-term solution, otherwise it will just hurt your profits going forward which could start a downward spiral.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Legal Action as a Last Resort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In extreme cases, you can consider legal action. This might be through the UK’s <strong>Small Claims Court</strong>, which can help you recover unpaid debts up to £10,000. However, this should always be a last resort, as it can damage business relationships and result in additional costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Can the Government Do to Help SMEs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government has recognised the problem of late payments and has introduced measures aimed at tackling the issue. However, more can be done to provide <strong>SMEs with the protection they need</strong> to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some actions the government could take:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Strengthen the Prompt Payment Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government’s <strong>Prompt Payment Code</strong> encourages large companies to pay their suppliers on time. While it’s a good initiative, it’s currently <strong>voluntary</strong>, meaning compliance isn’t guaranteed. Making the code <strong>mandatory</strong> for large companies—particularly those working with SMEs—could help ensure smaller businesses get paid faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Introduce Penalties for Late Payments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, businesses can claim statutory interest on late payments, but it’s rarely enforced. If the government introduced more significant <strong>financial penalties</strong> for companies that fail to pay SMEs on time, it could act as a stronger deterrent and improve payment practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Create a Late Payment Regulator</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Establishing a dedicated <strong>late payment regulator</strong> could provide SMEs with a clear avenue for recourse when dealing with persistent late payers. A regulator could oversee disputes, enforce penalties, and promote best practices to ensure fairer payment terms across all sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Greater Access to Finance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To help SMEs manage the cash flow crunch caused by late payments, the government could improve access to low-cost finance. Expanding the availability of <strong>government-backed loans</strong> and simplifying the application process for SME financing could give businesses more breathing room when waiting on late invoices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Improving Digital Tax and Accounting Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By continuing to expand <strong>Making Tax Digital</strong> (MTD) and encouraging more businesses to adopt digital tax and accounting tools, the government can help SMEs better track their cash flow and identify late payments more quickly. A more transparent digital system would also make it easier for businesses to pursue unpaid invoices through official channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Late Payments Don’t Have to Be the End</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Late payments may be killing your SME now, but there are strategies you can use to tackle the problem head-on. By setting clear payment terms, following up on overdue invoices, and exploring financing options, you can take control of your cash flow. However, there’s only so much businesses can do on their own. It’s time for the UK government to take stronger action to support SMEs and ensure a level playing field when it comes to payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we understand the challenges that late payments bring.

But one big question remains: <strong>what percentage ownership should you ask for?</strong> Whether you&#8217;re negotiating as a potential investor, employee, or partner, understanding the different levels of ownership and the rights that come with them is crucial to making the right decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we help individuals and businesses navigate the complexities of company ownership, ensuring that you make informed choices that align with your goals. In this blog, we’ll explore what percentage ownership you should aim for, and what rights and responsibilities come with different ownership stakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding Share Ownership: It’s About More Than Just %</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you own shares in a company, your percentage of ownership is crucial, but it’s about more than just numbers. Your <strong>voting power</strong>, influence, and potential returns all depend on how many shares you hold relative to others. To figure out what percentage you should ask for, you need to consider how much control and decision-making power you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break it down:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Minority Shareholder: Less than 50% Ownership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>minority shareholder</strong> is someone who owns <strong>less than 50%</strong> of the company’s shares. This is a common position for investors, employees offered shares, or partners who don’t want (or aren’t offered) a controlling stake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rights of Minority Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Voting Rights</strong>: You can vote at general meetings, but your influence is limited by the size of your stake. If you own 10% of the shares, for example, you have 10% of the voting power.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-are-dividend-vouchers/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"123\">dividends</a></strong>: If the company declares dividends, you’ll receive a proportionate share based on the percentage of shares you hold.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Access to Information</strong>: As a shareholder, you have the right to access company financial statements and attend general meetings, where you can voice your opinions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protection from Unfair Prejudice</strong>: Minority shareholders have legal protections under UK law, ensuring that directors or majority shareholders don’t act unfairly to diminish their rights or value in the company.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limitations for Minority Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Control Over Decisions</strong>: You won’t have the final say in key decisions like appointing directors, approving dividends, or major company actions (such as mergers or issuing new shares).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vulnerability to Majority Decisions</strong>: The majority shareholders make the big decisions, and you’ll generally have to go along with their choices, even if you disagree.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Significant Influence: 25% or More Ownership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Owning <strong>25% or more</strong> of the company’s shares gives you a more significant voice. While you’re still a minority shareholder, this percentage gives you a <strong>blocking power</strong> on certain key decisions, specifically those requiring a <strong>special resolution</strong> (which we’ll explain below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rights of 25% or More Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Blocking Power on Special Resolutions</strong>: In the UK, a <strong>special resolution</strong> requires 75% of the votes to pass. These resolutions can include major decisions like changing the company’s articles of association, issuing new shares, or approving certain mergers and acquisitions. If you own <strong>25% or more</strong>, you can block these resolutions, giving you a significant influence even as a minority shareholder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Access to Key Financials</strong>: Like other shareholders, you have access to company records and reports. But with a larger stake, directors are more likely to consider your opinions seriously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividends and Voting Rights</strong>: Your dividend entitlement and voting power increase proportionately with your shareholding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limitations for 25% Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Still a Minority Voice</strong>: While you have blocking power on special resolutions, you’re still not in control of day-to-day decisions or simple resolutions (which require just over 50% approval). You’ll need to align with majority shareholders for significant changes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Majority Shareholder: 50% Ownership or More</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Owning <strong>50% or more</strong> of the company’s shares makes you a <strong>majority shareholder</strong>, giving you considerable control over the company’s direction and decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rights of Majority Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Control Over Ordinary Resolutions</strong>: Most decisions in a company, such as appointing directors, approving dividends, and determining business strategy, are made via <strong>ordinary resolutions</strong>, which require a simple majority (over 50%) to pass. If you hold 50% or more of the shares, you essentially control these decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Electing and Removing Directors</strong>: As a majority shareholder, you can <strong>appoint and remove directors</strong>. This gives you the ability to shape the leadership team and strategy of the business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Influence Over Business Strategy</strong>: Your ownership gives you significant influence over the company&#8217;s strategy and direction, allowing you to shape its future in line with your vision.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividends and Financial Benefits</strong>: You’ll receive a significant share of any dividends paid out, and your financial interest in the company’s success increases.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Responsibilities of Majority Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Acting in the Best Interests of the Company</strong>: Even as a majority shareholder, you have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the company’s best interests. Abuse of power, such as sidelining minority shareholders or making decisions for personal gain, could lead to legal disputes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Liability Considerations</strong>: Although your personal liability is generally limited to the value of your shares, as a majority shareholder, your influence means you could be more closely scrutinised for decisions that negatively impact the company.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. 75% or More Ownership: Maximum Control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own <strong>75% or more</strong> of the shares, you essentially control the entire company. This percentage of ownership gives you the power to pass both <strong>ordinary</strong> and <strong>special resolutions</strong>, which means you can make significant changes to the company without needing the approval of other shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rights of 75% or More Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pass Special Resolutions</strong>: You can pass special resolutions, which are required for major changes like altering the company’s articles of association, approving mergers, issuing new shares, and winding up the company.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Total Decision-Making Power</strong>: With 75% or more ownership, you have the highest level of control over the company’s operations, strategic direction, and legal structure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reap Maximum Financial Benefits</strong>: You’ll receive the largest share of any dividends and the greatest return if the company is sold or liquidated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Responsibilities of 75% or More Shareholders:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Greater Responsibility</strong>: With great power comes great responsibility. Owning 75% or more means that the success or failure of the company is largely on your shoulders, and decisions you make can significantly impact the company’s financial health and reputation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Legal and Fiduciary Duties</strong>: Like all shareholders, you must act in the company’s best interests, but as the primary decision-maker, you’re under more scrutiny to ensure that your decisions are fair, legal, and in line with the company’s goals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Should You Ask For?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what percentage should you ask for when being offered shares in a limited company? It depends on your goals and how involved you want to be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>If You Want a Passive Stake</strong>: If you’re simply looking for a return on investment and aren’t concerned with day-to-day decision-making, a <strong>minority stake</strong> (less than 25%) could be sufficient. This gives you a share of the profits without the responsibilities of running the business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If You Want Influence</strong>: If you want a say in key decisions, aim for <strong>25% or more</strong>. This gives you blocking power on major decisions (special resolutions) without needing to take on the responsibilities of full control.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If You Want Control</strong>: If you want to shape the company’s future and have control over its strategy, you’ll need to aim for at least <strong>50% ownership</strong>. This makes you the key decision-maker in the business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If You Want Maximum Control</strong>: For complete control over both ordinary and special resolutions, aim for <strong>75% or more</strong> ownership. This level gives you total authority over the company’s direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Find the Right Balance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being offered shares in a limited company is an exciting opportunity, but it’s essential to understand the level of influence and responsibility that comes with your ownership percentage. Whether you want to be a passive investor or take control of the company’s future, the right percentage depends on your goals and how involved you want to be. It’s important that each of the shareholders understands the contribution that each of them will make and expectations are managed, in order for them to continue working together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we’re here to help you navigate the financial and legal complexities of share ownership, ensuring you make the best decision for yours and the business’s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s Talk:</strong> Thinking about accepting shares in a company?

      "content": "\n<p>An HMRC inspection can sound daunting, but with the right preparation, you can turn this potentially stressful experience into a straightforward, manageable process. Whether you’re an individual taxpayer or running a business, knowing what to expect and how to prepare can make all the difference. As an accountancy practice that specialises in supporting individuals and businesses, we’ve helped countless clients successfully navigate inspections. In this blog, we’ll share our top tips to help you stay ready and stress-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Stay Organized with Your Records</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to handling an HMRC inspection is having your records in order. HMRC expects you to keep accurate and up-to-date records of your income, expenses, and other financial data. This applies to both individuals and businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, this includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Receipts and invoices;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payroll records;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bank statements; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>VAT records (if applicable).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals, make sure you have:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Proof of income (payslips, bank statements);</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Receipts for any tax-deductible expenses; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Records of property rental income or other side income.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All these records should be easily accessible and organized—whether digitally or in hard copy. <strong>HMRC can request records from as far back as six years</strong>, so having a good filing system is critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Know Why HMRC Might Inspect You</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC doesn’t randomly choose who to inspect. Certain triggers can flag you for an inspection, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Large fluctuations in income;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claiming unusually high expenses;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Filing late or making multiple corrections to your tax returns; and/or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Discrepancies between your tax return and third-party reports (e.g., banks, employers, or other entities).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding these triggers, you can proactively check your records and returns to ensure accuracy before HMRC ever contacts you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Conduct Regular Self-Audits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to stay prepared for an HMRC inspection is to conduct <strong>regular self-audits</strong>. This means reviewing your financial records and tax returns periodically to catch any errors before HMRC does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, review areas like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>VAT returns: Ensure that you’re claiming VAT correctly and aren’t missing any VAT obligations;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payroll: Check that your PAYE system is in order and you’re complying with the correct tax codes; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expenses: Make sure that any claimed expenses are legitimate and backed up by receipts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals, ensure:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your income tax return accurately reflects all sources of income; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’re not missing out on tax reliefs you’re entitled to, but also not claiming expenses you can’t justify.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This proactive approach can help you avoid penalties and minimize the stress of an actual inspection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Be Aware of VAT Obligations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is VAT-registered, this is one area where HMRC will often focus their attention. Accurate VAT accounting is crucial, as mistakes here can lead to significant penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay on top of your VAT obligations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ensure you’re charging the correct VAT rates on your products or services;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Double-check that you’re filing your VAT returns on time; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep detailed VAT records, including invoices and receipts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mistakes with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/i-have-a-vat-inspection-help-what-do-i-do/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"121\">VAT are a common reason for HMRC inspections</a>, so meticulous record-keeping in this area is essential. It is also common for HMRC to do a compliance check one of your first VAT return submissions, to ensure everything is in a good place. These can even take place over the telephone or e-meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Understand Your Rights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During an HMRC inspection, it’s important to remember that you have rights. Here’s what you can expect:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Advance notice</strong>: HMRC will usually give you prior notice of an inspection, though in some cases they may visit unannounced.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Right to representation</strong>: You can have an accountant or tax adviser present during the inspection. This can be invaluable for ensuring the process goes smoothly and your interests are represented.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fair treatment</strong>: HMRC is expected to conduct inspections professionally and fairly, without causing undue disruption to your business or personal affairs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If at any point you feel uncertain or uncomfortable, don’t hesitate to reach out to a tax professional. They can help clarify the situation and ensure that HMRC’s actions are appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Don’t Ignore HMRC Notices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive a notice from HMRC regarding an inspection, <strong>don’t ignore it</strong>. Respond promptly and work with them to arrange a time that’s convenient. Avoiding communication or failing to comply can lead to harsher scrutiny and potential penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re unsure about how to respond to an HMRC inquiry, seek advice from your accountant. They can help you prepare the required documents and liaise with HMRC on your behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Be Transparent and Cooperative</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When HMRC does inspect, it’s important to be transparent. If you’ve made an honest mistake, HMRC is more likely to be understanding if you cooperate fully. Concealing information or being uncooperative can raise red flags and lead to more thorough and invasive inspections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If HMRC finds an error, stay calm. They are often willing to work with you to correct mistakes without heavy penalties if they see that it was unintentional and that you’re doing your best to comply with their requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Seek Expert Help in Advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to stay prepared for an HMRC inspection is to work with a professional accountant. We can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Help you maintain compliant records;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conduct pre-inspection audits to identify potential risks; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Represent you during an inspection, ensuring the process goes as smoothly as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By getting expert help early on, you can ensure that your business or personal finances are always ready for an inspection. This not only minimizes the stress of an HMRC visit but also reduces the risk of errors and penalties. We also offer fee protection insurance, which means in the event of an inspection you will not be liable for our time and fees in supporting you for any work we have done for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Preparation is Key</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the post-COVID work there has been a significant and expected increase in inspections conducted by HMRC. However, an inspection doesn’t have to be a stressful ordeal if you’re well-prepared. Whether you’re an individual or a business owner, staying organised, understanding the triggers, and conducting regular reviews of your records can make all the difference. And remember, you don’t have to go through it alone—having a trusted accountant by your side can provide peace of mind and ensure you’re always one step ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need help preparing for an HMRC inspection?</strong> Contact us today.

For example, if your company is legally named <strong>“John Smith Enterprises Ltd,”</strong> you could use a more customer-friendly trading name like <strong>“Smith Catering”</strong> on your storefronts and marketing materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This option is perfect if you want to operate under a different name for branding purposes or even run multiple ventures under one company without the headache of setting up multiple legal entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Use a Trading Name?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A trading name gives you flexibility. If you’re thinking of branching into new markets, or maybe your business name is a bit too formal, a trading name can help you present a specific identity. It’s also a great way to test new ideas or launch a niche product line without changing your registered name or forming a new company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a business registered as <strong>“Green Solutions Ltd”</strong> may use <strong>“Green Landscaping”</strong> as a trading name for its outdoor services division, while still operating under the same legal umbrella.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rules Around Trading Names in the UK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although trading names offer flexibility, they come with rules to keep things clear and professional. Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Avoid Using Restricted Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t include certain terms in your trading name unless you have permission. Words like <strong>“Limited”</strong> (or “Ltd”), <strong>“LLP,”</strong> or <strong>“PLC”</strong> are off-limits unless you are registered as such. You also need permission to use words that imply a certain status, like <strong>“Charity,”</strong> <strong>“Royal,”</strong> or <strong>“Association.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. No Duplication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your trading name must not be too similar to an existing registered company or trademark, especially if it could cause confusion. Always check the <strong>Companies House</strong> database and the <strong>UK Intellectual Property Office</strong> to make sure your chosen name isn’t already taken.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Disclosure is Key</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re using a trading name, you must always include your <strong>full registered company name</strong> (including “Ltd” or “Limited”) on official documents like invoices, contracts, and letters. So, while your trading name might be front and centre on marketing materials, your customers need to know the legal entity behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Protecting Your Trading Name</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike a registered company name, a trading name isn’t automatically protected. If you want to stop others from using it, you’ll need to <strong>register it as a trademark</strong>. This will give you legal rights to prevent anyone else from using your trading name in your sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Can Do with a Trading Name</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Brand Flexibility</strong>: You can test different ideas or products by using trading names. Want to sell online under a catchy name while keeping your professional services business separate? A trading name lets you do just that.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tailor Your Message</strong>: If your business covers different sectors, trading names allow you to communicate more effectively with each customer group. For example, <strong>“Smith Electrical Ltd”</strong> can also operate under <strong>“Smith EV Charging”</strong> to focus on electric vehicle solutions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Boost Professionalism</strong>: Even if you’re a sole trader, using a trading name can give your business a more professional feel. Imagine switching from <strong>“John Doe, Gardener”</strong> to <strong>“Green Thumb Landscaping”</strong> – it sounds more polished, right?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Cannot Do with a Trading Name</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Legal Shortcuts</strong>: Using a trading name doesn&#8217;t let you escape your company’s legal obligations. For example, any debts, contracts, or liabilities belong to your registered business entity, even if you’re trading under a different name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Can’t Hide the Legal Name</strong>: On all official documents like contracts, letters, invoices, and websites, you still need to display your full legal company name (and registration details). This helps maintain transparency with customers and regulators.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don’t Forget VAT and HMRC</strong>: If you&#8217;re VAT-registered, you need to inform HMRC of your trading name and ensure that both the trading name and registered company name appear on VAT invoices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advice for Small and Microbusinesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start Simple</strong>: If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to worry too much about complex structures. A trading name can give you flexibility without overwhelming you with administrative tasks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check Before You Launch</strong>: Always search the Companies House register and the UK trademark database before settling on a trading name to avoid potential legal issues.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consult with an Accountant</strong>: Before making any significant changes, it&#8217;s always a good idea to consult with an accountant. They can advise you on the financial and legal implications, especially around tax and VAT reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Get Started?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A trading name can be a powerful tool to help your business grow and evolve. Whether you&#8217;re testing a new market, trying to create a stronger brand identity, or just want to add a touch of professionalism to your business, it offers flexibility without all the red tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still not sure if it’s the right move for you?

      "content": "\n<p>It’s that time of year when Santa Claus dusts off his red suit, the elves rev up production in the workshop, and Rudolph starts his pre-flight warm-ups. But have you ever wondered what taxes Santa might pay if he operated in the UK? While the North Pole might be beyond HMRC’s reach, let’s imagine for a moment that Santa’s grotto is subject to UK tax laws. Here’s the rundown on Santa’s potential tax obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Corporation Tax – The Santa&#8217;s Workshop Ltd.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our scenario, Santa’s Workshop would likely be registered as a limited company (Santa&#8217;s Workshop Ltd., perhaps?), given its large-scale operation. HMRC would consider Santa a business owner, and as such, he’d be liable for Corporation Tax on the workshop’s profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say the elves are efficient, production is through the roof, and profits are jolly. With the current Corporation Tax rate set at 25%, the North Pole would be a little less sparkly as Santa hands over a portion of the workshop’s hard-earned Christmas cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Tip for Santa:</strong> Capital allowances! Santa can claim for all the machinery and sleigh upgrades—those elves need tools, after all!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Employment Taxes – Elves’ PAYE and National Insurance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Santa’s workshop employs a sizeable crew of elves. This means Santa must deal with PAYE and National Insurance contributions for his workforce. Given the volume of toys produced, it’s safe to assume that there are plenty of full-time positions. To comply, Santa would need to set up payroll, deduct income tax, and pay National Insurance for every elf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Tip for Santa:</strong> If the elves get seasonal bonuses, they might push into higher tax brackets. Santa should ensure that bonuses are spread across the year to keep things merry in the payroll department!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. VAT – Santa&#8217;s Magical Toy Distribution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Santa’s toy deliveries are arguably zero-rated as gifts, but if the workshop had any UK customers, sales would likely attract VAT. His distribution network might fall under zero-rated exports, but any workshops in the UK would mean he’d need to register for VAT if his turnover exceeded the threshold of £85,000. The good news? Santa might be able to reclaim VAT on workshop expenses, sleigh maintenance, and elf snacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Tip for Santa:</strong> Santa should keep records of all purchases and receipts. Who knew filing could be part of the holiday cheer?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Business Rates – North Pole Premises</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The North Pole might seem remote, but the Santa’s Workshop property would likely face business rates if it were in the UK. As a bustling workshop with heavy machinery, toy inventories, and a (very) active warehouse, business rates could put a dent in the Christmas fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Tip for Santa:</strong> If the workshop were to locate in certain UK areas, Santa could explore business rates relief options. Small workshops and certain rural businesses qualify for reductions—although the North Pole might be a bit far north for HMRC to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Sleigh Road Tax – Navigating the UK&#8217;s Roads and Airspace</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming Santa’s sleigh occasionally lands in the UK, he might face the Vehicle Excise Duty, or what we commonly call “road tax.” Santa’s sleigh is highly eco-friendly (it’s reindeer-powered), so he may even qualify for green vehicle incentives. In terms of airspace usage, he’d probably need clearance for the night of December 24th, and potential landing fees at high-traffic UK rooftops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Tip for Santa:</strong> Flying under the radar might help here—literally! Avoiding London Heathrow on Christmas Eve will reduce those pesky landing charges!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Gift Tax – What About the Presents?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, in the UK, there’s no gift <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/christmas-timeknow-tax/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"228\">tax on Christmas</a> presents. Santa can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the children of the UK can enjoy their gifts without facing a tax bill. However, for his more generous gifts—those lavish presents to adults—Santa should keep an eye on inheritance and gift tax regulations if he has a UK residency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Personal Tax – Santa’s Income Tax</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the CEO of Santa’s Workshop Ltd., Santa would pay himself a fair salary. As a high-income earner, he’d likely fall into the additional rate tax bracket, paying 45% on earnings over £125,140. And with the current dividend tax rates, Santa would face an additional charge if he took dividends from his thriving workshop’s profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Tip for Santa:</strong> By carefully balancing salary and dividends, Santa can make the most of his personal allowance and reduce his tax liability—a Christmas gift to himself!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Environmental Taxes – Clean Air for the Reindeer!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the environmental concerns and the magic dust used to fly the sleigh, Santa might be liable for environmental taxes if his grotto emits any pollutants. Fortunately, Santa’s eco-friendly operation, powered by reindeer and renewable cheer, keeps emissions low. But if the reindeer ate too many brussels sprouts… well, we’ll leave that tax headache for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thought: Is Santa Off the Hook?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Santa isn’t actually liable to UK tax (phew!), his tax obligations would be no small matter if he were based here. So next time you leave out milk and cookies, remember—Santa works hard year-round, managing his workshop, keeping his elves paid, and juggling an imaginary tax bill that would make any accountant’s head spin!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy Holidays from your friends at Black and White Accounting! 🎄</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>As the calendar turns from 2024 to 2025, we find ourselves in a moment of reflection—a chance to look back on a year of challenges, triumphs, and change, while also looking forward to the opportunities and possibilities that lie ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we believe in taking stock of the bigger picture. This past year, we’ve seen significant shifts in the UK economy, political landscape, and regulatory frameworks that impact businesses and individuals alike.

Despite global economic headwinds, businesses in the UK demonstrated their ability to adapt to changing conditions. Inflation began to stabilise after a turbulent period, and interest rates reached a plateau, offering some predictability for businesses navigating borrowing and investment decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology continued to lead the charge</strong>, with businesses of all sizes embracing digital transformation. From AI-driven tools to the rise of hybrid working solutions, 2024 was a year of embracing innovation and change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Politically, the UK saw a mix of stability and shifts. International trade agreements opened new doors for businesses, while ongoing negotiations highlighted the complexities of operating in a globalised world. The government&#8217;s commitment to fostering entrepreneurship and supporting SMEs remained a bright spot, with funding and incentives helping businesses thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Accounting and Tax Changes in 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, 2025 brings with it some significant changes in accounting and tax regulations, which will impact businesses and individuals alike.

      "content": "\n<p>Big changes are on the horizon for parents with children in private schools. The UK government’s proposal to introduce VAT on private school fees could affect thousands of families and businesses. As a small accountancy practice, we’re already receiving questions from clients about how this will play out, who will be impacted, and what—if anything—can be done to mitigate the financial hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we’ll break down the key points, how this might affect you, and what steps you should take to stay ahead of these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Proposed VAT Change: What’s Happening?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government’s plan to impose a 20% VAT on private school fees from 1 January 2025 is a major departure from the current system, where many independent schools enjoy tax-exempt status as registered charities. The aim of the change is to fund 6,500 new teachers in England, but, if enacted, will increase costs for parents and make it more expensive to educate children privately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For parents, this could mean thousands of pounds in additional fees annually. For the schools themselves, it could lead to reduced enrolments as some families seek alternatives in the state sector, not to mention the additional VAT compliance burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Will Be Affected?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of VAT on school fees will have wide-ranging impacts on several groups, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Parents and Families</strong>: If you’re already paying private school fees, you’ll need to prepare for a steep increase in costs. For families managing multiple children’s education or living on tight budgets, the additional 20% VAT could push private education out of reach.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Independent Schools</strong>: Many private schools may see a drop in enrolments, as parents seek more affordable options. Smaller schools could feel the pinch more acutely, with some potentially facing financial instability if enrolments decline sharply.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Businesses in the Education Sector</strong>: Any businesses connected to private schools, such as extracurricular services, tutoring, or uniform suppliers, may also be indirectly impacted by reduced disposable income among families.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For parents who own small businesses, managing cash flow and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"179\">tax planning</a> will become even more crucial as they juggle increased personal and educational expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Will These Changes Take Effect?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is understood that the measures will take effect from 1 January 2025, although there will be more clarification following the 2024 Autumn Budget on Wednesday 30 October 2024. Previous information published on 29 July 2024 left many questions unanswered and there is growing pressure for the government to defer the change until September 2025. Regardless, Parents, schools, and businesses in the education sector should begin planning now to ensure they’re prepared for the extra costs when the policy comes into effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Will VAT Be Applied?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT will be applied to private school tuition just as it is for most goods and services—meaning a 20% charge will be added to the cost of school fees. Schools will be required to register for VAT and adjust their billing accordingly. For many, this will mean upgrading their accounting systems and VAT compliance processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a small business owner, especially in the education sector, it’s worth thinking about how these changes might affect your customers and whether you need to adjust your own VAT registration or invoicing practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Avoid or Mitigate the Impact of VAT on School Fees?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, for most parents, there are limited ways to completely avoid this increase. However, there are a few strategies that might help ease the burden:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Bursaries and Scholarships</strong>: Some schools offer means-tested bursaries or scholarships, which could partially offset the rise in fees. Parents should explore whether they qualify for financial assistance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-Efficient Savings Plans</strong>: Consider utilising tax-free savings vehicles such as ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts) to build up a fund for school fees. While it won’t eliminate the VAT, it can help spread the financial load over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employer Contributions</strong>: Some businesses offer education allowances or salary sacrifice schemes to help cover school fees. If you’re a small business owner, it might be worth exploring ways to structure payments for your children’s education through your company, but be mindful of tax rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For schools and businesses, mitigating the effects of this change will come down to good financial management. Schools, in particular, may need to re-evaluate their operational costs and consider passing on only part of the VAT charge to parents to remain competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Our Accountancy Practice Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a small accountancy practice, we understand the pressures our clients face, whether they’re individuals, small business owners, or independent schools. Here’s how we can support you through these changes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>VAT Planning and Compliance</strong>: If you’re a school or business, we can help you set up proper VAT systems and ensure compliance with the new rules.

      "content": "\n<p>In today’s tech-driven world, it’s easy to think that accounting software can handle everything your business needs. After all, why pay for an accountant when there are apps and tools that can reconcile your bank statements, track your expenses, and file your taxes? While software is great for automating certain tasks, there’s a lot more to accounting than number-crunching. The reality is, having an experienced accountant by your side can take your business to the next level in ways that software simply can’t (at least yet).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At our dynamic and fast-growing UK accountancy practice, we support both individuals and businesses, offering more than just compliance—we’re your <strong>business partners</strong>. Here’s why no software, no matter how advanced, can replace the human touch and expertise of a professional accountant (at least yet).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Software Handles Data—Accountants Drive Strategy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting software is designed to process data and handle basic <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">bookkeeping</a> tasks. It can categorise your expenses, generate invoices, and even create reports. But what it can’t do is give you <strong>strategic advice</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your accountant isn’t just looking at your numbers—they’re analysing your financial health and helping you make <strong>informed decisions</strong> about the future of your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/manage-business-finances-christmas/\">business</a>. They offer insights that go beyond what software can provide, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax-saving opportunities</strong>: Software can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/online-calculators/\">calculate</a> your tax liability, but an accountant can help you <strong>reduce</strong> it. Whether it’s identifying <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-relief-for-individuals/\">tax reliefs</a>, claiming R&amp;D credits, or maximising allowances, we’ll make sure you’re not paying more tax than you need to.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Growth strategies</strong>: Thinking about expanding? An accountant can advise on funding options, assess risks, and help you <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/structures/\">structure</a> your business for long-term growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tips-for-managing-cashflow-for-smes/\">Cash flow management</a></strong>: While software shows your current cash flow, an accountant can help you plan for future financial challenges and ensure your business stays solvent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Complex Tax Regulations Require Expert Knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>UK tax regulations can be complex, and they’re constantly changing. Your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ultimate-guide-to-accounting-software-and-mtd/\">accounting software</a> will process the figures you input, but it won’t <strong>interpret</strong> tax laws/cases or stay updated on the latest changes in HMRC rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An accountant, on the other hand, is up to speed with the latest tax legislation and knows how to apply it to your business. From <strong>VAT</strong> to <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/corporation-tax/\">corporation tax</a></strong> and everything in between, we can ensure you stay compliant while taking advantage of every available opportunity to minimise your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Personalised Advice Tailored to Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is designed to be one-size-fits-all, but your business is unique. You need an accountant who understands the specific challenges and opportunities in your industry and can provide <strong>tailored advice</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At our practice, we take the time to understand your goals, whether you’re an individual looking to build wealth, a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/startup-calculator/\">startup</a> planning for growth, or an established business navigating complex financial issues. We provide personalised recommendations based on your unique circumstances, helping you make decisions that will benefit your business long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Support in Times of Crisis</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No software can offer the <strong>peace of mind</strong> and hands-on support that an accountant provides when things don’t go as planned. If your business faces financial difficulties or if you’re subject to an <strong>HMRC audit</strong>, having a trusted accountant by your side is invaluable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Negotiate with HMRC</strong> on your behalf, reducing the risk of penalties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help you manage debt, restructure your finances, and improve <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">cash flow</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide reassurance and guidance when navigating challenging times.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, an <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/partnership-services/\">accountant is a critical partner</a> in helping your business overcome obstacles and emerge stronger.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Efficiency and Time-Saving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s true that accounting software can automate routine tasks, but how much time do you still spend managing your finances? Inputting data, reconciling accounts, and double-checking figures can take valuable time away from running your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By working with an accountant, you can <strong>free up your time</strong> to focus on what you do best. We handle everything from bookkeeping and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/filing-tax-returns-and-expense-claims/\">tax filings</a> to financial forecasting, allowing you to get back to growing your business without worrying about the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Software Won’t Help You Plan for the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your accounting software might be great at recording the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/alternative-things-to-tax-inspiration-from-past-present-and-future/\">past and present</a>, but what about the future? Planning for growth, mitigating risks, and setting financial goals require a level of foresight and expertise that software simply doesn’t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An accountant can help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create financial projections</strong> to map out your future business performance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set realistic goals and develop strategies to meet them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plan for retirement</strong>, exit strategies, or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/essential-tips-to-supercharge-your-small-business-success/\">business succession</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t just focus on the numbers—we help you achieve your long-term ambitions, guiding you every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Human Touch Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let’s not forget the importance of the <strong>human element</strong>. As a dynamic and fast-growing accountancy practice, we believe in being more than just number-crunchers. We are <strong>business partners</strong> for our clients, providing advice, support, and a personal connection that no software can replicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you need help navigating a difficult financial situation or simply want someone to bounce ideas off, we’re here to help you with expert guidance and a genuine interest in your success. At our practice, we’re proud to be “<strong>Big Enough to Know and Small Enough to Care</strong>”—combining the expertise of a large firm with the personal touch of a boutique practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Accountants and Software—The Perfect Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line? Accounting software is a great tool, but it’s just that—a <strong>tool</strong>. It can make managing your finances more efficient, but it can’t replace the expertise, strategy, and personalised advice that a dedicated accountant offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to take your business to the next level, you need more than software. You need a partner who understands your vision, helps you plan for the future, and ensures that your business is compliant and optimised for growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">Contact us</a> today to discover how we can support you with expert accounting advice that goes beyond the software. Let’s work together to take your business from inception, through growth, into maturity!</p>\n",

Let’s explore what alphabet shares are, when they work, their pros and cons, and top tips for implementing them!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Alphabet Shares?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alphabet shares refer to different classes of shares within a company, typically categorised as A, B, C, etc. Each class can carry different rights and obligations, such as varying voting rights, dividend entitlements, and liquidation preferences. This flexibility allows business owners to tailor the share structure to meet their specific needs.​</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Customisation</strong>: Each class of shares can have distinct features, making it easier to manage ownership and control; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control</strong>: Business owners can retain control by issuing different classes of shares to various stakeholders​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Do Alphabet Shares Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alphabet shares are particularly effective in the following scenarios:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/family-businesses-the-pros-and-cons-what-you-need-to-know/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"114\">Family Businesses</a></strong>: When family members want to maintain control over decision-making while allowing others to invest, alphabet shares can be used to designate different rights​. They can also assist with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"188\">tax</a> planning;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investment Structuring</strong>: If a company wants to attract external investors without diluting the control of existing shareholders, it can issue shares with limited voting rights to new investors; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reward Schemes</strong>: Alphabet shares can be used as part of employee share schemes, granting specific rights to employees based on their performance​.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Don’t Alphabet Shares Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While alphabet shares offer many benefits, they may not be suitable in all situations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Introducing multiple classes of shares can complicate the company structure, making it harder for investors and stakeholders to understand the ownership model​;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost</strong>: The legal and administrative costs associated with creating and maintaining different classes of shares can be significant; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Potential Conflicts</strong>: Discrepancies in rights between different classes of shares can lead to disputes among shareholders, especially if not clearly defined​.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros and Cons of Alphabet Shares</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Tailor the rights and responsibilities associated with different classes of shares to suit various stakeholders​;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control</strong>: Retain control of the company while still allowing for investment and growth​; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tailored Rewards</strong>: Design share structures that can incentivise employees and align their interests with those of the company​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Multiple share classes can complicate governance and decision-making processes;​</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Increased administrative burden and legal costs associated with maintaining various classes of shares; and​</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Conflict Risk</strong>: Differences in shareholder rights can create tensions or disputes if not properly managed​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Tips for Implementing Alphabet Shares</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consult Legal Experts</strong>: Before introducing alphabet shares, consult with a legal professional to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations​.

SIPPs provide a flexible and tax-efficient way to save for your retirement, especially for individuals, business owners, and the self-employed who want more control over their investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we’ll walk you through the essentials of SIPPs, how they work, the benefits, and what you need to consider if you&#8217;re thinking of using one to build your retirement nest egg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a SIPP?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A SIPP is a type of personal pension plan that allows you to take full control over where your pension contributions are invested. Unlike traditional pension schemes, which are managed by a pension provider or employer, a SIPP gives you the freedom to choose from a wide range of investments, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Stocks and shares;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Government and corporate bonds;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unit trusts and investment funds;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commercial property;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs); and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cash.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>SIPPs are ideal for individuals who want to be more involved in managing their retirement funds or for business owners who want more flexibility and control over their pension contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Do SIPPs Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SIPPs work similarly to other types of pensions: you make contributions, and these contributions are invested to grow your retirement pot. The difference with a SIPP is that you have more control over where your money is invested. You can decide what assets to hold and how to diversify your portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can open a SIPP with various providers, such as banks, investment platforms, or specialised SIPP providers. The tax advantages of a SIPP are the same as with any other UK pension:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax relief</strong>: The government provides tax relief on your contributions. For example, basic rate taxpayers get 20% tax relief, meaning if you contribute £8,000, the government tops it up to £10,000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher rate taxpayers</strong>: If you&#8217;re a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim additional relief through your Self-Assessment tax return.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you reach the age of 55 (rising to 57 from April 2028), you can access your SIPP, typically with the option to take 25% as a tax-free lump sum, while the rest is taxed at your income tax rate when withdrawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are SIPPs Beneficial for Business Owners?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SIPPs are an increasingly popular way for individuals and business owners to take control of their retirement savings. They offer a variety of benefits, from flexible investment options to tax advantages. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the key advantages of SIPPs:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Control Over Investments</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Direct Investment Control</strong>: With a SIPP, business owners have direct control over how their pension funds are invested. This can include a wide range of asset classes, as mentioned above.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can tailor your investment strategy to align with your business’s financial goals and expertise, providing greater flexibility and control compared to traditional pension schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Tax-Efficient Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax Relief</strong>: Employer contributions made by the business into an individual’s SIPP are tax-deductible, reducing the company’s corporation tax liability. This allows businesses to build pension savings for owners and key employees while lowering their overall tax bill.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Income Tax Relief</strong>: Business owners who make personal contributions to their SIPPs benefit from <strong>income tax relief</strong> on those contributions, further enhancing tax efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The ability to contribute to SIPPs tax-efficiently helps businesses manage their tax liabilities while boosting the pension pots of directors and employees.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Investment in Commercial Property</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Buy Commercial Property</strong>: SIPPs allow business owners to invest in <strong>commercial property</strong> through their pension. For example, the SIPP can purchase the company’s premises, and the business can lease the property back from the SIPP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rent paid by the business goes directly into the SIPP, providing a regular income stream for the pension while being <strong>tax-deductible</strong> for the business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any growth in the value of the commercial property is free from <strong>capital gains tax</strong>, and rental income is free from <strong>income tax</strong> within the SIPP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strategic Asset for Business Owners</strong>: This arrangement allows business owners to use their pension to invest in real estate while securing long-term occupancy of their business premises.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Flexibility in Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexible Contributions</strong>: SIPPs allow businesses to vary their pension contributions, which can be particularly beneficial for business owners with fluctuating income or cash flow. You can contribute more in profitable years and scale back contributions during leaner periods without facing penalties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This flexibility helps businesses manage their finances more effectively while ensuring steady growth of pension savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Cost-Effective Retirement Savings for Directors and Employees</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Efficient Pension Scheme</strong>: SIPPs can be a cost-effective way to provide retirement savings for business owners and key employees. Rather than setting up a more complex pension scheme, directors can use SIPPs to manage their own retirement planning, reducing the need for extensive pension administration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This is a simpler and more efficient way for businesses to offer pension savings while keeping administrative costs low, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Tax-Free Growth on Investments</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax-Free Growth</strong>: Investments within a SIPP grow free from <strong>capital gains tax</strong> and <strong>income tax</strong>, allowing the pension fund to increase in value more efficiently than taxable investments held outside of a pension.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Tax-free growth accelerates the value of your pension savings, giving you a larger retirement pot over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Succession and Retirement Planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Succession Planning</strong>: SIPPs can be an effective part of a business owner’s <strong>succession planning</strong> strategy. By building a substantial pension pot through tax-efficient contributions and investment growth, business owners can plan for retirement without relying solely on the sale of the business to fund their later years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: A well-funded SIPP provides financial independence in retirement, allowing the business to be passed on to successors without the need to extract large amounts of capital from the company.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Access to a Wide Range of Investments</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Investment Flexibility</strong>: SIPPs offer a wide range of investment options, providing more freedom than traditional pension schemes. Business owners can invest in sectors they are knowledgeable about or diversify across multiple asset classes to spread risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This flexibility allows business owners to tailor their pension portfolios based on their expertise or market conditions, optimising returns while managing risks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. No Lifetime Allowance (from April 2024)</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unlimited Pension Savings</strong>: With the abolition of the <strong>lifetime allowance</strong> from April 2024, business owners can grow their SIPP pension pots without worrying about breaching a savings limit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This allows business owners to contribute and accumulate pension savings without being penalised for exceeding a lifetime cap, offering greater flexibility for long-term retirement planning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Tax-Free Lump Sum</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>25% Tax-Free Withdrawal</strong>: When the business owner reaches the minimum pension age (currently 55, rising to 57 in 2028), they can take up to <strong>25%</strong> of the pension pot as a <strong>tax-free lump sum</strong>. The remaining balance can be drawn as income, which will be taxed at their marginal rate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The tax-free lump sum offers financial flexibility for business owners in retirement, providing capital to reinvest, pay off debts, or support lifestyle changes without the burden of additional tax.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Succession and Inheritance Planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Inheritance Tax Efficiency</strong>: SIPPs provide a tax-efficient way to pass wealth to future generations. Upon the death of the SIPP holder, the remaining pension can be passed on to beneficiaries, often free from inheritance tax if the holder dies before age 75.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This makes SIPPs a valuable tool for long-term family financial planning, allowing business owners to preserve wealth for their loved ones while minimising tax liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Combining Business and Personal Financial Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Alignment with Business Strategy</strong>: SIPPs allow business owners to combine their personal financial goals with the long-term needs of the business. For example, using a SIPP to purchase commercial property not only helps secure business premises but also contributes to the owner’s retirement savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This alignment creates a more holistic approach to financial planning, allowing business owners to optimise their personal wealth while supporting the growth and stability of the business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are SIPPs Beneficial for Individuals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A SIPP offers significant flexibility and control for individuals looking to build their retirement savings. Unlike traditional pension schemes, SIPPs give you the power to choose how your pension fund is invested, allowing you to tailor your investments to match your personal financial goals. Whether you’re an experienced investor or simply looking for greater control over your retirement pot, SIPPs offer several advantages that make them an attractive option for individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the key benefits of SIPPs for individuals:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Greater Control Over Investments</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Direct Investment Choices</strong>: SIPPs give you <strong>full control</strong> over where your pension money is invested, unlike traditional pensions where the investment choices are typically made by the provider. With a SIPP, you can choose from a wide range of assets, as outlined above.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This level of control allows you to build a pension portfolio that matches your financial goals, risk tolerance, and expertise, giving you the flexibility to pursue higher growth potential or manage risk more effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Tax-Free Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax Efficiency</strong>: Like other pension schemes, investments held within a SIPP grow free from capital gains tax and income tax. This means you can reinvest all profits from your investments without worrying about tax implications, allowing your pension pot to grow more efficiently.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The tax-free environment helps accelerate the growth of your pension fund, giving you a larger retirement pot compared to taxable investment accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Investment in a Wide Range of Assets</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Broader Investment Choices</strong>: SIPPs allow you to invest in a much broader range of asset classes compared to traditional pensions. You’re not restricted to just managed funds or standard pension products. Instead, you can diversify your portfolio by investing in:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Commercial property</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Individual stocks and shares</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commodities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Private company shares</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This wide variety of investment options provides more opportunities for diversification and allows you to tailor your pension investments to market conditions or personal preferences, potentially enhancing your returns.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Flexibility in Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexible Contribution Levels</strong>: With a SIPP, you can contribute as much or as little as you like, up to the annual allowance (currently £60,000 for the 2024/25 tax year). This flexibility is ideal if you have variable income or if you want to make larger contributions during profitable years and smaller contributions when necessary.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Carry Forward Unused Allowances</strong>: If you haven’t used your full annual allowance in the past three years, you can carry forward unused allowances, enabling you to contribute more when you have extra funds available.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The flexibility to adjust your contributions based on your financial circumstances ensures that you can manage your pension savings without overstretching your budget.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. 25% Tax-Free Lump Sum</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax-Free Withdrawal</strong>: Upon reaching retirement age (currently 55, rising to 57 in 2028), you can withdraw up to 25% of your SIPP pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. The remaining 75% can either be left invested to grow further or withdrawn as taxable income over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The tax-free lump sum provides financial flexibility to cover major expenses, invest elsewhere, or simply enjoy retirement without being taxed on that portion of your savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Tax Relief on Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Generous Tax Relief</strong>: Contributions to your SIPP qualify for tax relief. This means that for every £8,000 you contribute, the government adds £2,000, bringing the total contribution to £10,000. If you’re a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim additional tax relief through your Self-Assessment tax return.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This tax relief effectively boosts your pension contributions, helping your savings grow faster without additional out-of-pocket costs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Inheritance and Succession Planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax-Efficient Inheritance</strong>: SIPPs offer excellent inheritance tax (IHT) benefits. Upon your death, the remaining pension can be passed to your beneficiaries free of inheritance tax if you die before age 75. Even after 75, the pension can still be passed on, though it will be subject to income tax when accessed by your beneficiaries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: SIPPs allow you to pass on your wealth to future generations in a tax-efficient manner, making them a valuable tool for long-term family financial planning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. No Lifetime Allowance (from April 2024)</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unlimited Pension Growth</strong>: As of April 2024, the UK government has abolished the lifetime allowance on pension savings. This means there’s no longer a limit on how much you can save in your SIPP without facing additional tax penalties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This change allows you to continue growing your SIPP without worrying about breaching savings caps, giving you more freedom to build a substantial retirement fund.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Flexibility in Retirement Income</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pension Drawdown</strong>: SIPPs offer flexible drawdown options, allowing you to decide how and when you access your pension funds. You can take out regular income, one-off lump sums, or leave the money invested for further growth, giving you control over how you manage your retirement income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This flexibility helps you manage your income tax liability by allowing you to draw down your pension in a way that suits your personal tax situation and financial needs during retirement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Pension Consolidation</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Simplified Pension Management</strong>: A SIPP allows you to consolidate multiple pensions into one scheme. If you have pension funds from different employers or personal pensions, you can transfer them into your SIPP, making it easier to manage your retirement savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Consolidating pensions provides a clearer view of your overall retirement savings and simplifies administration, allowing you to make more strategic investment decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Diversification Opportunities</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduce Risk with Diversification</strong>: SIPPs enable you to invest in a wide range of assets, reducing the risk of having all your savings tied to one investment class. You can spread your investments across different sectors, industries, and geographical locations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Diversification helps protect your pension savings from market volatility and enhances the potential for growth, leading to a more robust retirement portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Protection from Creditors</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Asset Protection</strong>: Like all pension schemes, assets held within a SIPP are protected from creditors, even if you experience financial difficulties. This provides additional security for your retirement savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your pension savings remain secure and untouched, even in the event of personal financial challenges or bankruptcy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things to Consider Before Opening a SIPP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) offer many benefits, such as greater control over investments and tax efficiency, they also come with some potential disadvantages that individuals and business owners should consider before diving in. Here are the key drawbacks of SIPPs:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Investment Risk</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Higher Risk Exposure</strong>: SIPPs allow you to invest in a wide range of assets, but with more investment freedom comes increased risk. If you’re not experienced in managing investments, you might make poor decisions that could reduce your pension pot&#8217;s value.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Market Volatility</strong>: Investments like stocks, shares, and property can fluctuate in value, which may cause your pension fund to decrease during downturns.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Fees and Costs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Higher Fees</strong>: SIPPs often come with more complex fee structures compared to standard personal pensions. Charges can include setup fees, annual management fees, and transaction costs, especially if you’re actively trading assets or investing in specialized options like commercial property.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Potential Hidden Costs</strong>: If you&#8217;re not careful, various fees can add up quickly, which can erode your pension’s value, particularly if you have a smaller pension pot.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Management Complexity</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Active Management Required</strong>: SIPPs give you full control, but that also means you’re responsible for making investment decisions. If you lack the time or expertise, managing your SIPP could become burdensome.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overwhelming Choices</strong>: With such a wide array of investment options, it can be overwhelming to decide where to put your money. Poor decisions or neglecting to review your portfolio regularly can hurt your long-term savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Not Suitable for Everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>More Suited to Experienced Investors</strong>: SIPPs are generally more suitable for individuals with some investment knowledge. If you’re new to investing, you might feel unsure about where to start or might prefer the security of a managed pension.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Risk of Poor Diversification</strong>: If you don’t diversify your investments properly (e.g., putting too much into one asset class like property or shares), your pension fund may suffer due to market downturns in that sector.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Potential Tax Implications</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Annual and Lifetime Allowance Limits</strong>: Like other pensions, SIPPs are subject to annual and lifetime contribution limits. Exceeding these limits can result in tax penalties:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Annual Allowance</strong>: For most people, the annual contribution limit is <strong>£60,000</strong> (2024/25 tax year), but contributions above this amount will incur tax charges.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lifetime Allowance</strong>: Though the lifetime allowance limit has been abolished from April 2024, tax implications may still arise if the total value of your SIPP and other pensions exceeds certain thresholds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Restrictions on Access</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Locked Until Age 55 (Rising to 57)</strong>: Like other pension schemes, you can&#8217;t access your funds in a SIPP until you turn 55 (or 57 from 2028). This could limit flexibility if you need access to your funds earlier.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax on Withdrawals</strong>: While 25% of your pension can be taken as a tax-free lump sum, the rest is subject to income tax when you start withdrawing from it. Depending on your circumstances, this could push you into a higher tax bracket.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Commercial Property Risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complexity of Property Investment</strong>: Investing in commercial property through a SIPP can be appealing, especially for business owners, but it’s a complex area with risks. Property values can fluctuate, and property management comes with ongoing costs such as maintenance, insurance, and finding tenants.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Liquidity Issues</strong>: Property is a relatively illiquid asset, meaning it can take time to sell if you need access to funds quickly. This could be problematic if you need to draw from your pension and can&#8217;t liquidate the property fast enough.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Provider Restrictions</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Limited Investment Options</strong>: While SIPPs offer more investment choices than standard pensions, some providers impose limits on what you can invest in. If your chosen SIPP provider restricts access to certain asset types, you may not get the full benefits of a SIPP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complex Withdrawal Rules</strong>: Not all providers offer the same flexibility in accessing your pension. Some might have more restrictive or costly processes for drawing down your pension once you reach retirement age.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Time and Expertise Required</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Active Management Needed</strong>: SIPPs often require more ongoing attention than standard pensions. If you prefer a hands-off approach or lack investment experience, this could become burdensome. Without proper monitoring and rebalancing of your portfolio, your pension’s performance could suffer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Potential Regulatory Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Changing Pension Rules</strong>: Pension rules can change over time. For example, the government has raised the minimum age at which you can access pensions from 55 to 57 starting in 2028, and future changes could impact how and when you can access your pension. Investors in SIPPs need to stay informed about regulatory changes to avoid surprises.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is a SIPP Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SIPPs are a great option for those looking for more control over their retirement savings. However, they aren&#8217;t for everyone. If you have the time, knowledge, and desire to manage your investments, then a SIPP could be an excellent way to build a more tailored retirement plan. But if you&#8217;d rather leave it to the experts, a more traditional personal pension plan might suit you better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help individuals and business owners navigate the world of pensions and retirement planning. Whether you&#8217;re thinking about opening a SIPP or exploring other retirement options, our team of experts is here to guide you through the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Take Control of Your Retirement?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SIPPs offer flexibility, control, and significant tax advantages, but it’s important to get it right. If you’re unsure where to start, or you need advice on whether a SIPP is suitable for your financial future, contact us today. We’ll help you make an informed decision; you work very hard for the money you earn, so make sure that it works equally hard for you!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The UK is rapidly embracing digital payments, with the use of cash declining year by year. As businesses and consumers move toward more efficient, tech-savvy solutions, the question arises: <strong>Will Britain soon become a fully cashless society?</strong> And what does this mean for businesses navigating the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we are always looking ahead to ensure our clients stay ahead of the curve—so let’s dive into the future of a cashless Britain, the government’s role in this shift, and the challenges businesses will face in this new landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Digital Payment Revolution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re already seeing a surge in digital payment options—from contactless cards to mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and fintech innovations like Revolut and Monzo. In 2020, cash payments accounted for just 17% of all transactions, a significant drop from previous years, and the pandemic only accelerated this trend. By 2023 this had fallen to 12%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal of going <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/cash-death-or-evolution/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"209\">cashless</a> is obvious:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Convenience</strong>: Digital transactions are faster and more convenient for both businesses and consumers. No need to count change, and payments can be made anywhere, anytime;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Security</strong>: Cash can be lost or stolen, but digital transactions are traceable, offering an added layer of protection for businesses; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: For businesses, going cashless means fewer cash-handling tasks and lower overheads on security and banking fees.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as the country leans into this <strong>digital payment revolution</strong>, it’s also raising important questions about what a cashless society could mean for businesses—and for the government’s ability to tax everything it wants to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making Tax Digital (MTD): The Government’s Response</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the economy becomes more digital, the UK government has responded with initiatives like <strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong>. Launched in 2019, MTD is the government’s effort to bring the UK tax system into the 21st century. But why the rush?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MTD</strong> aims to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Increase Tax Accuracy</strong>: By requiring businesses to submit tax data digitally, HMRC can reduce errors, improve efficiency, and close the tax gap—estimated to be worth billions of pounds due to underreporting or non-compliance;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improve Transparency</strong>: With more real-time data on business income and expenses, HMRC can get a clearer picture of the UK’s financial landscape, making it easier to track what’s owed; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Modernize the Tax System</strong>: As businesses go digital, so must the government. MTD is part of a broader push to modernize the entire tax system, ensuring it’s fit for purpose in an increasingly cashless economy.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>While <strong>MTD</strong> is a step toward streamlining tax compliance, it also signals the government’s recognition that it must adapt to a world where traditional cash transactions are becoming rare. The UK is a long way behind countries like Italy and Portugal (formerly the PIGS of Europe) where the government have gone so far that a business owner can get arrested if they do not provide a receipt for a sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rise of Cryptocurrency: A New Challenge for the Taxman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While digital payments are becoming the norm, another trend poses a unique challenge for both businesses and the government: the <strong>rise of cryptocurrency</strong>. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies have seen meteoric growth in recent years, and as more businesses start accepting them as payment, they introduce a new complexity to the tax landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages to businesses, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Global Reach</strong>: Crypto allows businesses to accept payments from anywhere in the world without the need for intermediaries or excessive fees;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Faster Transactions</strong>: Unlike traditional bank transfers, which can take days to process, cryptocurrency transactions are often completed in minutes; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lower Costs</strong>: With fewer transaction fees, crypto can offer cost savings for businesses—particularly those with international clients.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the government, <strong>crypto</strong> creates a significant tax headache. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized, often anonymous networks, making it difficult for tax authorities to track transactions. While HMRC has begun imposing capital gains taxes on crypto profits, the decentralized nature of the currency makes it hard to enforce taxation on every transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As crypto becomes more widely adopted, it could further complicate the government’s efforts to tax everything they want. Businesses that deal in crypto will need to stay on top of evolving regulations to avoid falling foul of HMRC’s rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What a Cashless Future Could Look Like for Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the rise of digital payments and cryptocurrencies might seem like an exciting frontier, it’s important for businesses to prepare for the challenges that come with it. Here’s what you need to consider as Britain moves further toward a cashless future:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adapting Your Payment Systems</strong><br>If you’re not already set up to accept digital payments, now is the time to make the switch. Investing in contactless payment systems, mobile wallet integrations, and even cryptocurrency payment gateways will ensure your business stays competitive and accessible to tech-savvy customers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complying with Digital Tax Regulations</strong><br>With <strong>Making Tax Digital</strong> in full swing, you’ll need to ensure your accounting systems are compatible with HMRC’s digital requirements. This means using MTD-compliant software to keep track of your income and expenses and submitting tax returns electronically.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Preparing for Crypto Taxation</strong><br>If your business accepts or deals in cryptocurrency, understanding your tax obligations is crucial. HMRC treats cryptocurrency as property, meaning you’ll need to report any gains or losses when filing taxes. Staying on top of crypto tax rules can help you avoid penalties down the line.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Navigating Cybersecurity Risks</strong><br>With more digital payments comes the increased risk of <strong>cyberattacks</strong>. Ensuring your business has robust cybersecurity measures in place to protect customer data and transactions will be essential in a cashless world. This includes securing your payment systems, training staff on cybersecurity best practices, and regularly auditing your IT infrastructure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Future is Digital—Is Your Business Ready?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Britain marches toward a <strong>cashless future</strong>, businesses must be prepared to adapt. Whether it’s ensuring your payment systems are up to date, staying compliant with <strong>Making Tax Digital</strong>, or understanding the tax implications of <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>, now is the time to future-proof your operations. The transition to a cashless society might seem daunting, but with the right support and planning, it can open up exciting opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we’re committed to helping businesses navigate the evolving financial landscape. Whether you need advice on digital tax compliance, crypto taxation, or preparing your business for a cashless future, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s Talk:</strong> Is your business ready for the cashless future?

      "content": "\n<p>Family businesses are the backbone of the global economy, contributing significantly to employment and economic growth. In the UK, family-run businesses range from small start-ups to large, multi-generational companies. While working alongside loved ones offers many benefits, family businesses also come with their own unique set of challenges. If you&#8217;re involved in a family business—or thinking of starting one—understanding the advantages and potential pitfalls can help you succeed for generations to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we’ll explore the pros and cons of family businesses, provide insights into succession planning, and share tips to ensure your family enterprise thrives. As a UK accountancy practice supporting individuals and businesses, we’ve worked with numerous family-run firms, and we’re here to help you navigate the complexities of family business dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Family Businesses?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A family business is any company in which two or more family members are involved, with the family having significant control or influence over the business&#8217;s operations and strategy. Family businesses can range from small corner shops to large, multi-national corporations like JCB or Dyson. In many cases, they are passed down through generations, with a focus on long-term stability and growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what makes family businesses unique is the blend of personal and professional relationships. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons that come with these intertwined dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Pros of Family Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Strong Sense of Commitment and Loyalty</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family businesses often benefit from a high level of commitment from family members. There’s a shared sense of purpose and a collective desire to see the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/scaling-success-what-every-fast-growing-business-needs-to-thrive/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"102\">business thrive</a>, often leading to increased motivation and dedication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantage</strong>: Family members are likely to go the extra mile for the success of the business, working long hours and making personal sacrifices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Long-Term Focus</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike publicly traded companies that are often focused on short-term gains, family businesses tend to take a long-term view of growth and success. This long-term approach can foster stability and make the business more resilient during economic downturns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantage</strong>: Decision-making is often driven by legacy-building and sustainability, rather than immediate profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Shared Values and Trust</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a family business, there&#8217;s typically a strong alignment in terms of values and goals. This sense of trust and common purpose can lead to smoother operations and a more harmonious working environment, especially when making important decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantage</strong>: You can often avoid conflicts of interest and bureaucracy, making the decision-making process quicker and more straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Lower Recruitment Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family businesses often recruit from within the family, which can reduce recruitment and onboarding costs. Moreover, family members might be more flexible when it comes to working hours, salary, and job roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantage</strong>: This can lead to reduced staffing costs and higher loyalty among employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Cons of Family Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Personal Conflicts Affecting Business</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for family businesses is the overlap between personal relationships and business matters. Disagreements or misunderstandings within the family can spill over into the business, causing tension and affecting performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: Personal issues can impact business decisions, leading to poor communication or decisions driven by emotion rather than logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Resistance to Change</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family businesses can sometimes struggle with change, especially if earlier generations are reluctant to adapt to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-can-ai-help-my-business-in-2025/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"16\">new technologies</a> or business practices. This resistance can hinder growth and lead to missed opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: Being too rooted in tradition may prevent innovation and make it difficult to compete in modern markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Nepotism and Lack of Meritocracy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s natural for family businesses to prioritise hiring family members, this can sometimes lead to nepotism, where less qualified individuals are placed in key roles simply because of their family ties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: This can demotivate non-family employees and lead to poor business performance if the wrong people are put in charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Succession Challenges</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most complex issues facing family businesses is succession planning. Deciding who will take over the business and when can lead to conflicts, especially if there are multiple family members vying for leadership roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: Lack of a clear succession plan can cause uncertainty, disputes, and even the collapse of the business when leadership is not smoothly transitioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Succession Planning: Ensuring a Smooth Transition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Succession planning is crucial for the long-term success of any family business. Without a clear plan, the business may struggle to survive when leadership passes from one generation to the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steps to Effective Succession Planning:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start Early</strong>: Begin discussing succession plans well before retirement or a potential exit. This ensures that all family members are on the same page and reduces the risk of conflict.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify Future Leaders</strong>: Assess the skills, experience, and interests of potential successors. Consider both family and non-family members for leadership roles based on merit and qualifications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Formalise the Plan</strong>: Document your succession plan, outlining roles, responsibilities, and timelines for the transition. Make sure to include contingency plans in case the intended successor is unable to take on the role.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Provide Training and Mentorship</strong>: Offer leadership training, mentorship, and opportunities for successors to gain experience in key areas of the business. This helps prepare them for the transition and ensures they are equipped to take on leadership roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek Professional Advice</strong>: Work with legal, financial, and business experts to ensure that your succession plan is legally sound and financially viable. <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"187\">Tax planning</a> is particularly important in family business succession, as you’ll want to minimise the tax burden on the next generation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Consult with a financial advisor or accountant to develop a tax-efficient succession plan that ensures the business remains financially secure during the transition.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Thriving as a Family Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Separate Work and Family Life</strong>: Create clear boundaries between work and personal life to avoid conflicts. Consider formalising business meetings with set agendas and specific times for family discussions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open Communication</strong>: Foster an environment of transparency where all family members feel comfortable voicing their opinions. Regular family meetings can help address concerns early and prevent issues from escalating.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Involve Non-Family Members</strong>: Bringing in non-family executives or advisors can bring fresh perspectives and professional management expertise to the table, which can help mitigate the risks of nepotism and resistance to change.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Formal Agreements</strong>: Have formal agreements in place regarding ownership, roles, and compensation. This helps ensure that the business runs smoothly and that all family members are clear on expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Is a Family Business Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Family businesses offer many benefits, from deep-rooted commitment and shared values to long-term stability. However, they also present challenges, including personal conflicts, succession planning, and the risk of nepotism. By understanding both the pros and cons, you can navigate these challenges and ensure your family business thrives for generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work closely with many family businesses, supporting them with tax planning, succession planning, and financial management, to name but a few.

      "content": "\n<p>For property businesses in the UK, understanding the difference between revenue and capital expenses is key to managing your finances and maximizing tax efficiency. If you&#8217;re an investor, landlord, or developer, knowing how HMRC treats these costs can save you money and keep your business on the right track. Let’s dive into the distinctions between these types of expenses and explore how they affect your property business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Revenue Expenses?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenue expenses, also known as day-to-day running costs, are the costs you incur to maintain or operate your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-can-hammock-help-my-property-business/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"107\">property business</a>. These are generally recurring expenses that keep the business functioning, or what I like to call “like-for-like expenses”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples of Revenue Expenses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Repairs and Maintenance</strong>: Fixing a broken window, mending roof tiles, or repainting a wall are examples of typical repairs. These are seen as keeping the property in its current state.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilities</strong>: Water, electricity, and gas bills for rental properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Management Fees</strong>: Paying a letting agent or property manager.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Policies covering buildings and rental properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staff Costs</strong>: Wages for employees managing properties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Treatment of Revenue Expenses:</strong> Revenue expenses are <strong>tax-deductible</strong> in the same financial year they occur. This means you can offset these costs against your property income, reducing your taxable profits. For instance, if your rental income is £50,000 and you have £10,000 in deductible revenue expenses, you&#8217;ll only pay tax on £40,000 of profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Capital Expenses?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital expenses refer to the money spent on buying, improving, or adding value to a property. These costs are typically one-off or infrequent but are substantial in nature. The key difference is that they enhance the value of the asset or increase its lifespan, or what I like to call “capital improvements”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples of Capital Expenses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Property Purchase Costs</strong>: Buying a property for your portfolio, including legal fees and Stamp Duty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improvements</strong>: Converting a loft into a living space, adding an extension, or upgrading to modern double glazing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Structural Work</strong>: Major renovations like replacing an entire roof or gutting and refurbishing a property to increase its market value.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Furnishings</strong>: Installing new kitchen units or bathrooms in rented properties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Treatment of Capital Expenses:</strong> Capital expenses cannot be immediately deducted from your income for tax purposes. Instead, they are added to the <strong>base cost of the property</strong> and come into play when you sell the property through <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</strong>. The higher your capital expenditure, the lower your taxable gain when you eventually sell the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you purchase a property for £200,000 and later sell it for £300,000, your capital gain would be £100,000. However, if you spent £20,000 on qualifying capital improvements, your base cost would increase to £220,000, reducing your gain to £80,000 for CGT purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Pitfalls: Revenue or Capital?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC’s rules aren’t always straightforward, and sometimes it’s tricky to figure out whether an expense is revenue or capital. One important test is whether the expenditure is simply maintaining the property or improving it. If you’re replacing something like-for-like (e.g., swapping out a broken door), it’s likely a revenue expense. But if you’re upgrading or adding something new, it’s probably capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 1: Replacing a boiler</strong> If you replace an old boiler with a new model of the same standard, this is typically a <strong>revenue expense</strong>. However, if you upgrade to an advanced, energy-efficient system, HMRC may consider it a <strong>capital expense</strong>, as the improvement adds value to the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 2: Redecorating after tenant damage</strong> Repairing or redecorating due to tenant wear and tear, such as repainting or patching holes in walls, would generally fall under <strong>revenue expenses</strong>. On the other hand, if you decide to knock down walls to create an open-plan layout, this would be classified as a <strong>capital expense</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maximising Tax Efficiency: Key Tips</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep Detailed Records</strong>: Accurate records of all your expenses help ensure you&#8217;re claiming all allowable deductions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Separate Costs</strong>: Be mindful of what can be claimed as revenue and capital expenses and keep them separate in your accounting. This makes it easier to track and report your taxes correctly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilize Capital Allowances</strong>: For some capital expenses, you may be able to claim capital allowances, which allow you to deduct a percentage of the cost from your profits each year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek Expert Advice</strong>: A good accountant can help navigate the grey areas and ensure you’re claiming the correct tax reliefs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How We Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we specialise in helping individuals and businesses in the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-structure-should-my-property-business-be/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"212\">property sector</a> navigate these tricky tax distinctions.

      "content": "\n<p>Being a <strong>shareholder</strong> in a company offers you a stake in its financial success—but what if you’re not a director? Can you still influence the business? What exactly are your rights and responsibilities?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we know that understanding the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-the-difference-between-a-director-and-a-shareholder/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"18\">relationship between shareholders and directors</a> is key to navigating your role effectively. Whether you’re a small shareholder or a significant investor, understanding your position within the company can empower you to make informed decisions. In this blog, we’ll break down what it means to be a <strong>shareholder without being a director</strong>, and how you can leverage your role to protect your interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a Shareholder?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>shareholder</strong>, also known as a stockholder or member, is an individual or entity that owns one or more shares in a company. Shares represent ownership in the company, which means shareholders have a financial interest in the business’s success. Depending on how many shares you own, you may also have <strong>voting rights</strong> on important company matters. However, shareholders are not responsible for the day-to-day management of the company—that’s the job of the <strong>directors</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Rights as a Shareholder (Without Being a Director)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a shareholder, you may not have direct control over the company’s operations, but you still have important rights that protect your investment. Here’s what you can expect:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The Right to Vote on Major Decisions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant rights you have as a shareholder is the <strong>right to vote</strong> on major company decisions. This includes matters such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Appointing or removing directors</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Approving significant changes to the company’s structure or operations (such as mergers or acquisitions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Issuing new shares or altering the rights attached to existing shares</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight of your vote is usually proportional to the number of shares you hold. For example, if you own 10% of the shares, you typically have 10% of the voting power. Even though you’re not directly involved in managing the company, your vote on these big issues can influence its future direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The Right to Dividends</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the company makes a profit and chooses to distribute some of those profits to its shareholders, you have the right to receive <strong>dividends</strong>. However, it’s important to note that dividends are not guaranteed; directors must first decide to declare dividends, and the company must be in a financially stable position to make these payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dividends are usually paid in proportion to the number of shares you own, meaning the more shares you hold, the bigger your potential payout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The Right to Inspect Company Records</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a shareholder, you have the right to <strong>inspect certain company records</strong>, including the company’s annual financial accounts. This transparency is essential to ensure that directors are managing the company responsibly and in the shareholders’ best interests. You can request access to statutory records and financial documents, allowing you to keep an eye on how the company is performing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. The Right to Call a General Meeting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shareholders with a significant enough stake (usually 5% or more) have the right to <strong>call a general meeting</strong> if they believe an important issue needs to be discussed. This can be particularly useful if you feel that the directors are not acting in the best interests of the shareholders, or if you want to bring a significant issue to the attention of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. The Right to a Share of Assets Upon Liquidation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the unfortunate event that the company is wound up (liquidated), shareholders have the right to receive a portion of the company’s remaining assets, <strong>after all debts and liabilities</strong> have been paid. However, creditors are paid first, so shareholders typically receive their share only if there’s anything left over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Responsibilities as a Shareholder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While shareholders enjoy a variety of rights, they also have certain <strong>responsibilities</strong> to the company:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Paying for Shares</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve agreed to purchase shares in the company, your primary responsibility is to <strong>pay for those shares</strong> in full. Whether you’ve bought them directly from the company during an initial offering or through a private sale, ensuring that your shares are paid for is a legal obligation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Compliance with Shareholder Agreements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s a <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-a-shareholder-agreement-do-i-need-one/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"106\">shareholder agreement</a></strong> in place, you must adhere to its terms. Shareholder agreements outline how the business is run, the rights and obligations of shareholders, and how certain situations (like selling shares) will be handled. It’s crucial to understand the agreement and follow its rules, as failure to do so could result in legal consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Respecting Company Decisions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While shareholders have voting rights, they must also accept the outcome of decisions made in accordance with the company’s articles of association. If the majority of shareholders vote in favor of a particular action, all shareholders are typically bound by that decision, even if they disagree with the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Don’t Have as a Shareholder (Without Being a Director)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a shareholder but not a director, there are a few things you won’t have control over:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Day-to-Day Management</strong>: Directors are responsible for the <strong>operational</strong> and <strong>strategic decisions</strong> of the company. As a shareholder, you don’t get involved in the daily running of the business or in decisions like hiring, marketing, or customer management. You also, for example, might not have access to the company bank account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Influence on Strategy</strong>: While you can vote on major decisions, you won’t have direct control over the company’s strategy unless you’re also a director or hold significant shares that give you more influence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Automatic Right to Profits</strong>: Dividends are not guaranteed. Directors decide whether to declare dividends based on the company’s financial health and future needs, so shareholders may not receive regular payouts if the company is reinvesting profits or facing financial challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Still Influence the Business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a director, you can still influence the company’s direction—especially if you hold a significant number of shares. Here’s how you can leverage your position:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Build Strong Relationships with Directors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a good relationship with the company’s directors can help ensure your voice is heard. If you’re a significant shareholder, directors may seek your input on important decisions, even if you don’t have a formal role in management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Exercise Your Voting Rights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to <strong>vote</strong> in shareholder meetings. Whether it’s to appoint new directors, approve key business strategies, or vote on the company’s future direction, exercising your voting rights gives you a say in how the business is run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Stay Informed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By regularly reviewing the company’s financial statements, staying up to date on business news, and attending shareholder meetings, you can make sure you’re fully informed about the company’s performance and direction. Being an active shareholder helps you protect your investment and make strategic decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: A Unique Role with Important Powers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a <strong>shareholder but not a director</strong> puts you in a unique position. While you don’t have the day-to-day control over the company, you still hold significant rights that allow you to influence major decisions, protect your investment, and potentially profit from the company’s success. Understanding these rights—and your responsibilities—ensures you’re fully equipped to make the most of your role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we help shareholders understand their legal position, maximise their influence, and protect their investments.

      "content": "\n<p>Selling your business is a major milestone, and whether you&#8217;re looking for a fresh start or planning your retirement, preparing your business for sale is critical to getting the best possible price. If you’re an individual or business owner in the UK thinking about selling, here’s an exciting step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process, from preparing your business to closing the deal!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Why Sell?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding why you want to sell is crucial to the process. Your motivation will influence your exit strategy and the timing of the sale. Some common reasons include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Retirement;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New ventures;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Health issues; and/or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A desire to cash out after years of hard work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the reason, having a clear purpose will keep your journey focused and help potential <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-find-a-buyer-for-your-business/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"204\">buyers understand the value of your business</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Getting Your Business in Shape</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you list your business for sale, it’s essential to make it as attractive as possible to potential buyers. Here are some key steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Financial Clean-Up:</strong> Ensure your books are in order and reflect a profitable, stable business. Make sure you have up-to-date accounts, tax records, and clear financial projections. Strong cash flow and profits are always appealing to buyers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Streamlining Operations:</strong> Buyers are attracted to businesses that can run smoothly without heavy reliance on the current owner. Delegate responsibilities, automate processes where possible, and tighten up any inefficiencies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer Base:</strong> A loyal and diverse customer base is a huge asset. Show buyers that your business has a strong, repeatable revenue stream by nurturing your client relationships.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contracts &amp; Agreements:</strong> Make sure all contracts with suppliers, customers, and employees are formalised and up to date. This adds security for a buyer and avoids any legal headaches.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brand &amp; Marketing:</strong> Strengthen your business’s presence with effective branding and marketing strategies. Consistent branding and a solid online reputation can make your business stand out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Valuation Techniques</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The value of your business is one of the most important factors in the selling process. Several valuation techniques can help determine a fair asking price:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Asset-Based Valuation:</strong> This method involves valuing your business based on its assets and liabilities. It’s ideal for companies with significant tangible assets, like manufacturing businesses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Income-Based Valuation:</strong> Common for service-oriented businesses, this method values the business based on projected future earnings, often using metrics like EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Market-Based Valuation:</strong> Here, your business is valued based on the sale prices of similar businesses within your industry. This comparison can give you a ballpark figure of what buyers might be willing to pay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the old saying goes, “something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it”, but valuation techniques can help facilitate any conversation between a buyer and seller. There are often long-established valuation techniques which are well-established in specific industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Selling Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several routes you can take when selling your business, each with its own pros and cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Direct Sale to a Buyer:</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Pros:</em> Can maximise sale price, offers flexibility in negotiations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Cons:</em> May take time to find the right buyer, often requires significant preparation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Management Buyout (MBO):</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Pros:</em> Management already knows the business, ensures continuity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Cons:</em> May offer a lower price than external buyers, could be complex to arrange.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Selling to a Competitor:</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Pros:</em> Competitors may pay a premium to eliminate competition or expand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Cons:</em> Can lead to employee or customer apprehension if sold to a rival.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Selling to a Private Equity Firm:</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Pros:</em> Typically offers higher valuations for growth potential, more resources for expansion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Cons:</em> Involves loss of control and can be a lengthy process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Merger or Acquisition:</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Pros:</em> Can unlock synergies, often results in a higher valuation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Cons:</em> May complicate existing business operations, possible cultural clashes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. What Buyers Look For</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyers will evaluate your business’s attractiveness through several lenses, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Profitability and Growth Potential:</strong> Is your business scalable?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Industry Trends:</strong> Does your industry have a bright future, or is it in decline?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strong Leadership and Staff:</strong> A well-run business with competent employees is more attractive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reputation:</strong> A positive public perception and strong brand can set your business apart.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Preparing for Due Diligence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve found a buyer, due diligence begins. This is where the buyer will scrutinise every aspect of your business to ensure they’re getting what they’re paying for. Be prepared with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Financial documents</strong>: Up-to-date profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and tax returns.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Legal documents</strong>: Contracts, intellectual property rights, lease agreements, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employee information</strong>: Organisational chart, key staff, employment contracts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operational manuals</strong>: Documenting day-to-day processes makes transition easier.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Closing the Deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once due diligence is complete, it’s time to finalise the sale. At this stage, ensure you have a great legal advisor to review the sale agreement and handle negotiations (if you don’t already have one, we’d be delighted to put you in touch with one!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A smooth handover plan will help facilitate the buyer&#8217;s transition, ensuring your business continues to thrive under new ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after the deal is concluded, it can be very hard for seller to let go of their “legacy”, so it can be important to proactively discuss next steps or other projects which might be of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Potential drawbacks of selling your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling your business is a big decision, and while it can offer financial rewards and personal freedom, there are some potential disadvantages to consider. Here’s a look at the key downsides of selling your business:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Loss of Control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sell your business, you’re relinquishing control. For many owners, their business is not just a source of income but a passion project built over many years. After the sale, decisions regarding the business direction, operations, and staff will be in the hands of the new owner. This loss of control can be emotionally challenging, especially if the buyer takes the business in a direction that you don’t agree with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Emotional Attachment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A deep emotional connection to the business can make it difficult to let go. Many owners find it hard to separate their identity from the company they’ve built, leading to second-guessing or regret after the sale. The emotional toll of selling can sometimes overshadow the financial rewards, especially if the buyer does not share your vision or values.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Tax Implications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling your business can result in significant tax liabilities, especially if the sale includes a capital gains tax on the profit made from the sale. In the UK, business owners can benefit from schemes like Business Asset Disposal Relief (formerly Entrepreneur’s Relief), which reduces capital gains tax to 10%, but there may still be substantial tax to pay, depending on the sale price and your tax situation. It’s essential to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"186\">plan ahead with a tax</a> advisor to minimise the tax burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Financial Risk in Payment Structures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all business sales are cash deals. In some cases, buyers may propose a payment structure involving instalments or earn-outs, where future payments depend on the business’s performance after the sale. This creates financial risk for the seller, as future payments may not materialise if the buyer fails to meet performance targets or encounters financial issues. You may also need to remain involved in the business for some time during the transition period, which could delay your plans for a complete exit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Impact on Employees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling the business can create uncertainty for employees, especially if the buyer plans to make significant changes to operations or staffing. Long-standing employees may feel unsettled or face layoffs, and you may feel responsible for their future, creating guilt or concern about the well-being of your team after the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Potential Drop in Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is highly dependent on you, the owner, for its day-to-day operations, its value may drop once you step away. Buyers might see your exit as a risk and adjust their offer accordingly. This can be particularly true for small businesses where personal relationships with customers, suppliers, or employees are a key factor in the company’s success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Lengthy Sale Process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling a business can take time, sometimes years, depending on the size and complexity of the company and market conditions. The process involves preparing the business for sale, finding the right buyer, negotiating terms, and going through due diligence. During this time, your attention may be divided between running the business and managing the sale process, potentially leading to a decline in business performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Post-Sale Non-Compete Restrictions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyers often require non-compete agreements as part of the sale, restricting you from starting or running a similar business in the same industry for a specified period. This can limit your future business opportunities if you’re considering staying in the same sector after the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Reduced Income Potential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the sale may result in a lump sum payout, it’s possible that your ongoing income from the business could have been higher if you continued running it. Especially if your business is growing, you may be leaving future profits on the table by selling too early. Additionally, if you sell during a downturn or unfavourable market conditions, you may not get the full value of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Challenges of Life After Sale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many business owners, the question of &#8220;what’s next?&#8221; looms large after selling. Transitioning into a new career or retirement can be challenging, especially if your identity has been closely tied to your business for years. The change can lead to a sense of loss, boredom, or dissatisfaction if you haven’t planned for life after the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling your business can be a rewarding and life-changing event, but it’s not without its drawbacks. Being aware of these disadvantages and planning for them can help you make a more informed decision. Careful consideration, along with professional advice from accountants, financial planners, and legal experts, can ensure that your sale benefits you both financially and personally in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Don’t Go It Alone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling your business is one of the biggest financial decisions you&#8217;ll make, so don’t hesitate to seek professional help. Whether it’s business valuation, due diligence support, or legal advice, an experienced accountant or advisor can guide you through the complexities of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the better prepared your business is, the more appealing it will be to buyers. And, with the right steps and planning, you can walk away with the financial reward your hard work deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find yourself in this position, we’d love to talk to you today to understand more about you, your business and how we can potentially support you during this process.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>In the fast-paced world of business, understanding the foundational documents that govern your company is crucial. One such document is the <strong>Articles of Association (AoA)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we’re dedicated to helping you navigate the complexities of business regulations, ensuring your company is set up for success. Let’s dive into what Articles of Association are, what they include, and why they are essential for your business!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are Articles of Association?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Articles of Association are a set of written rules that outline how a company is governed and operated. This document is a fundamental part of a company&#8217;s constitution, alongside the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-the-memorandum-of-association/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"103\">Memorandum of Association</a>. The AoA specifies the rights and responsibilities of the company’s members and directors, forming the framework for how decisions are made and how the business is conducted​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Do Articles of Association Include?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Articles of Association typically cover several key areas, including, but not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Company Name</strong>: The official name of the company;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company Purpose</strong>: The objectives for which the company has been established;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Administrative Structure</strong>: Guidelines for the company’s governance, including the appointment and removal of directors;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shareholder Meetings</strong>: Procedures for calling and conducting meetings, including voting rights and quorum requirements;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Powers and Duties of Directors</strong>: Details on what directors can and cannot do, and how decisions are made​; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividend Distribution</strong>: The process for how profits are shared among shareholders​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Do Articles of Association Not Include?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While AoA are comprehensive, they do not cover every aspect of a company’s operations. They typically do not include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Operational Procedures</strong>: Day-to-day management practices are often addressed in internal policies rather than the AoA;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Financial Regulations</strong>: Detailed financial practices and accounting methods are generally not part of the AoA; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employee Rights</strong>: Employment contracts and employee relations are not covered in the AoA, as these are governed by separate legal frameworks​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Model Articles?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Model Articles are standardised templates provided by the UK government that can be used as the Articles of Association for a company. These are default provisions that apply to companies incorporated under the Companies Act 2006, unless the company chooses to adopt bespoke articles​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Do Model Articles Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Model Articles are particularly effective for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>New Companies</strong>: Startups can benefit from the simplicity and comprehensiveness of model articles, ensuring they comply with legal requirements without having to draft their own; and​/or</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sole Director Companies</strong>: They provide a straightforward framework for companies with only one director, helping to avoid complications in governance​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Don’t Model Articles Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Model Articles may not be suitable when:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Specific Needs</strong>: Businesses with unique operational requirements may need bespoke articles to address specific governance or operational issues; and/or</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multiple Share Classes</strong>: Companies with complex share structures may require customised articles to define the rights associated with different share classes​.

      "content": "\n<p>As a business owner, you wear many hats—leader, visionary, and problem-solver. But did you know that you also have important responsibilities when it comes to pensions and auto-enrolment? For many employers, pensions can feel like a confusing and daunting obligation, but they’re a crucial part of looking after your employees and complying with the law. In this blog, we’ll break down the essentials of pensions and auto-enrolment, helping you understand exactly what you need to do—and why it matters for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. What is Auto-Enrolment?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto-enrolment is a government initiative introduced in October 2012 to help employees save for their retirement. As the name suggests, it requires employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ssas-a-guide-for-individuals-and-business-owners/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"67\">workplace pension</a> schemes. The idea is simple—every employer, regardless of size, must provide their employees with access to a pension scheme and contribute towards it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does this mean for you as an employer?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Who Needs to be Auto-Enrolled?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every employee will need to be auto-enrolled. To be eligible, an employee must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be aged between <strong>22 and state pension age</strong>;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earn more than <strong>£10,000 per year</strong>; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work in the UK.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees who do not meet these criteria can still choose to “<strong>opt-in</strong>”, but as an employer you can choose if you contribute to their pension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Employer Contributions: What’s Your Obligation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto-enrolment isn’t just about signing your employees up—it also means making regular contributions to their pensions. Currently, the <strong>minimum contribution</strong> required by law is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>3% from the employer</strong>; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>5% from the employee</strong> (deducted from their salary).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These contributions are calculated based on &#8220;qualifying earnings,&#8221; which include wages, bonuses, overtime, and certain statutory payments. The employer can decide if it is calculated on the gross or net amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Choosing the Right Pension Scheme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As an employer, you’ll need to choose a <strong>qualifying pension scheme</strong> to enrol your employees into. Not all schemes meet the necessary requirements, so it’s important to select one that is compliant with auto-enrolment rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular options include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>NEST (National Employment Savings Trust)</strong>: A government-backed pension scheme designed specifically for auto-enrolment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>People’s Pension</strong>: Run by B&amp;CE, a not-for-profit, it is open to businesses of all size offering simple, affordable and flexible solutions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Private pension providers</strong>: Many financial institutions offer pension schemes tailored for businesses of various sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s essential to compare schemes and choose one that offers flexibility, ease of management, and good value for both you and your employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. What Happens If an Employee Opts-Out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees have the right to ‘<strong>opt-out’</strong> of the pension scheme if they wish. However, as an employer, you cannot encourage or pressure them to do so. Once an employee opts-out, they won’t be auto-enrolled again for three years, unless they choose to rejoin sooner. Despite this, you still need to re-enrol them every three years as part of your legal duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that opting out is less common, as many employees recognise the long-term benefits of pension savings, especially when employers are making contributions on their behalf. If you have a high number of employees opting out, this might lead to questions from the Pensions Regulator.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. The Importance of Staying Compliant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto-enrolment is not a one-off task—it’s an ongoing responsibility. As an employer, you need to ensure that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New employees are assessed and enrolled when they become eligible;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contributions are paid on time; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The scheme remains compliant with auto-enrolment regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to meet your obligations can result in penalties from <strong>The Pensions Regulator</strong> (TPR). Penalties can range from a fixed fine of £400 to escalating daily penalties of up to £10,000 depending on the size of your business. Employees can receive a letter when their employees fall behind on contributions, which can raise some difficult conversations. Compliance is therefore crucial to avoid costly penalties and protect your business&#8217;s reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Re-Enrolment Every Three Years</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every three years, you must go through a <strong>re-enrolment process</strong>, where eligible employees who opted out or left the scheme must be automatically re-enrolled. This process ensures that employees are given regular opportunities to review their pension participation and make informed decisions about their future. Make sure you do this in plenty of time, to avoid unnecessary penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. How an Accountant Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing pensions and auto-enrolment is an ongoing task that can take up time and resources, especially for small businesses. This is where partnering with a knowledgeable accountant comes in handy. We can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Assess your workforce</strong> to determine who is eligible for auto-enrolment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help you choose and set up a compliant <strong>pension scheme</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure that <strong>contributions</strong> are calculated accurately and submitted on time (especially as employees join and leave).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handle the <strong>administrative burden</strong> of staying compliant with The Pensions Regulator.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support you with <strong>re-enrolment processes</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With our expertise, you can focus on what you do best—running and growing your business—while we take care of the finer details of compliance and contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. The Benefits of Pensions for Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto-enrolment is a legal requirement, but it’s also a fantastic way to show your employees that you care about their future. Offering a pension scheme can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Boost employee retention</strong>: Employees are more likely to stay with an employer that offers benefits like pension contributions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attract top talent</strong>: In today’s competitive market, offering a pension scheme can make your business stand out to potential recruits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improve employee morale</strong>: Knowing that their future is secure can lead to happier, more productive employees.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: It’s More Than Just Compliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pensions and auto-enrolment may feel like just another box to tick, but they’re much more than that. By offering a well-managed pension scheme, you’re investing in your team’s future and ensuring that your business complies with UK law. And with the right accountant by your side, managing this responsibility can be simple, efficient, and stress-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is your business ready for auto-enrolment?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact us today to discuss how we can support your business with compliant, streamlined pension solutions tailored to your needs.

It combines rent tracking, expense management, and mortgage monitoring into a single platform, helping you streamline your financial operations and keep on top of your property portfolio’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros of Using Hammock for Your Property Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Real-Time Financial Tracking</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Hammock’s most powerful features is its ability to track your property finances in real-time. The software connects directly to your bank accounts, automatically categorising income and expenses for each property. This gives you a live view of how your portfolio is performing, which is particularly useful for landlords with multiple properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can see exactly which tenants have paid rent, track late payments, and monitor your cash flow with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Automated Rent Collection and Alerts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammock helps automate rent collection, saving you time and effort. It tracks rent payments for each property and tenant, notifying you of any late or missed payments. Automated alerts ensure that you never miss an important payment date or rent due.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: No more manual tracking of rent payments or worrying about missed payments—Hammock does it all for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.

It automatically generates detailed reports on rental income, expenses, and profits, which are essential for completing your tax returns.

Mortgage Management</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For landlords with mortgaged properties, Hammock’s mortgage monitoring feature is invaluable. The software allows you to track mortgage payments, interest rates, and loan balances, helping you stay on top of your mortgage obligations and make informed decisions about refinancing or additional borrowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Easily monitor mortgage performance and explore ways to optimise your mortgage strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Portfolio Performance Overview</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have multiple properties, Hammock gives you a clear, consolidated view of your portfolio’s financial health. You can track rental yields, capital growth, and operating expenses across your entire portfolio, helping you make strategic decisions about your properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Comprehensive financial insights make it easier to identify underperforming properties or opportunities for growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cons of Using Hammock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Cost</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammock is a subscription-based service, and while it offers a wide range of features, it may be seen as an additional expense for smaller landlords or those with tight budgets. The cost varies depending on the size of your portfolio and the features you require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downside</strong>: The monthly subscription fee might not be ideal for landlords with just a few properties, especially if they already use other accounting software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Limited Integration with Other Systems</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Hammock provides a strong property-focused solution, it may not integrate seamlessly with all other accounting or property management software you may already be using. This could lead to duplicating work or managing multiple systems side by side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downside</strong>: Landlords who already use comprehensive accounting tools like Xero or QuickBooks may find it less useful without tight integration between platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Limited Features Beyond Finance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammock is primarily a financial tool, meaning it lacks the broader property management capabilities that other platforms might offer, such as maintenance scheduling or tenant communication tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downside</strong>: You may need separate tools for broader property management tasks beyond financial tracking, increasing the complexity of your tech stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative Software Packages for Property Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Hammock offers excellent finance tracking for landlords, other software platforms might be a better fit depending on your business’s needs. Here are some alternatives worth considering:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Arthur Online</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Arthur Online is a comprehensive property management platform that covers all aspects of managing your portfolio, from finances to tenant communication. It integrates with <strong>Xero</strong> for accounting, making it a more holistic solution for landlords who want to manage both operational and financial tasks in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Comprehensive property management tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seamless integration with Xero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tenant communication and maintenance management</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>More complex to set up and use for smaller portfolios</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Xero with Add-Ons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For landlords already using <strong>Xero</strong> for accounting, integrating it with property-specific add-ons like <strong>Arthur Online</strong> or <strong>Re-Leased</strong> can give you a full financial and property management solution. Xero offers powerful financial tracking, invoicing, and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"185\">tax planning</a>, and you can customise it with other tools to suit your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Powerful accounting and financial tracking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customisable with industry-specific add-ons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strong reporting capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Requires multiple tools and integrations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not property-specific out of the box</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Landlord Vision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Landlord Vision is a property management software designed specifically for landlords, covering tenant management, rent tracking, and accounting.

      "content": "\n<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of business ownership, understanding your rights and responsibilities as a shareholder is crucial. At Black and White Accounting, we are committed to empowering individuals and businesses with the knowledge they need to thrive. One key document that every shareholder should consider is the <strong>shareholder agreement</strong>. But what is it, why is it essential, and when do you need one? Let’s dive into the details!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Shareholder Agreement?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A shareholder agreement is a legally binding contract among the shareholders of a company. This agreement outlines the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of each shareholder and governs the operation of the company. It serves as a roadmap for decision-making and establishes procedures for important events, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Share transfers;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividends distribution;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dispute resolution; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exit strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, it helps ensure that all shareholders are on the same page, reducing the risk of conflicts and misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is a Shareholder Agreement Needed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Clarity and Structure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A shareholder agreement provides clarity on the roles and responsibilities of each shareholder. It sets expectations and helps prevent disputes by clearly defining how the business should be run and how decisions are made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Protection of Interests</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a dynamic business environment, the interests of shareholders can diverge. A well-drafted agreement protects individual interests, ensuring that each shareholder’s rights are respected, especially in scenarios involving buyouts, sales, or disputes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicts are inevitable in any business. A shareholder agreement includes mechanisms for resolving disputes, which can help avoid costly legal battles and maintain a healthy working relationship among shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Facilitates Smooth Transitions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a shareholder decides to sell their shares or pass them on, the agreement lays out the process, ensuring a smooth transition that aligns with the interests of all parties involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Attracts Investors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors are often more willing to invest in businesses with clear governance structures. A shareholder agreement demonstrates that the business is well-organised and committed to protecting stakeholder interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When is a Shareholder Agreement Needed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s beneficial for all companies, a shareholder agreement is particularly essential in the following situations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Starting a New Business</strong>: If you&#8217;re forming a new company with multiple shareholders, having an agreement in place from the start can prevent potential conflicts down the road. We’ve found it can be a really good exercise as whilst drafting the shareholder agreement, you can go through lots of potential scenarios of what could happen on your business and this can be a great way to futureproof your business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Changes in Shareholding</strong>: If there’s an addition or removal of shareholders, it’s crucial to update or create an agreement to reflect the new dynamics. How will this impact your position? Is there anyone you want to ensure does not get shares or influence on your company?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seeking Investment</strong>: When attracting new investors or partners, having a shareholder agreement is vital to outline their rights and obligations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Before Major Decisions</strong>: If your business is contemplating significant changes, such as mergers or acquisitions, an agreement ensures that all shareholders agree on the process. This enables your interests to be protected but the business to continue to operate day-to-day.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Tips for Creating a Shareholder Agreement</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Involve Legal Experts</strong>: Engage a legal professional experienced in company law to draft or review your agreement (we’re happy to recommend someone for you!). This ensures that it complies with the law and covers all necessary aspects.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be Thorough</strong>: Address all critical areas, including decision-making processes, profit distribution, and exit strategies. Leaving out details can lead to confusion later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review Regularly</strong>: As your business evolves, so should your shareholder agreement. Regularly review and update it to reflect any changes in the company structure or shareholder relationships.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Include Dispute Resolution Procedures</strong>: Clearly outline how disputes will be resolved. Consider including mediation or arbitration clauses to avoid lengthy court battles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Communicate Openly</strong>: Ensure all shareholders understand the agreement. Open communication fosters trust and prevents misunderstandings.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reflections</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The percentage of UK limited companies that have a shareholder agreement varies, but estimates suggest that around 50% to 60% of private limited companies (Ltd) may have one in place. While there’s no legal requirement for companies to have a shareholder agreement, and many scenarios are covered by the Articles of Association (AoA) of a company (primarily governed by the Companies Act 2006), it is highly recommended for any limited company with multiple shareholders to mitigate conflicts and protect shareholder interests​.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses recognise the importance of these agreements, especially as they grow or seek external investment. A well-drafted shareholder agreement can significantly enhance governance and clarity within a company, making it easier to handle issues like share transfers, decision-making processes, and dispute resolution.​</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A shareholder agreement is not just a legal formality; it’s a vital tool that can safeguard your investment and streamline your business operations. At Black and White Accounting, we believe that every shareholder should have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities. Whether you’re starting a new venture or looking to formalise your existing arrangements, a shareholder agreement can provide the clarity and protection you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering creating or updating a shareholder agreement, contact us today!

      "content": "\n<p>When most people think of accountants, they picture someone buried in spreadsheets, balancing the books, or filing tax returns. But in today’s fast-paced business landscape, the role of an accountant goes far beyond just ensuring “compliance”. A good accountant doesn’t just help keep you out of trouble with HMRC—they can be the secret weapon driving your business towards sustainable growth and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an accountancy practice that specialises in supporting individuals and businesses, we’re here to show you why you need us for far more than just keeping your numbers in check.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Strategic Business Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of every growing business is a solid strategy. Your accountant can provide insights that help shape your business’s direction. We dig into your financial data, uncovering key trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities that could be holding you back or pushing you forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re considering expansion, diversifying revenue streams, or launching a new product, having an accountant involved in the strategic process means you’ll be making data-driven decisions. Our deep understanding of your business finances allows us to advise on risk management, profitability, and growth strategies that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Cash Flow Management: The Lifeblood of Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how profitable your business looks on paper, if you run out of cash, you&#8217;re in trouble. Effective <strong>cash flow management</strong> is essential to keeping your operations running smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We help you maintain healthy cash flow by forecasting future needs, identifying potential shortfalls, and advising on when to invest or pull back. Our goal is to ensure that your business has the liquidity it needs to not just survive—but thrive. Plus, if you&#8217;re looking to secure financing or investment, having accurate cash flow projections can make all the difference in securing the best deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Tax Planning: Keep More of Your Hard-Earned Profits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just about filing taxes correctly—it’s about ensuring you’re paying the right amount of tax, no more and no less. Smart <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"184\">tax planning</a></strong> can make a significant impact on your bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By staying on top of the latest tax legislation, we help you minimise tax liabilities through allowable deductions, tax reliefs, and efficient structuring. Whether you’re a sole trader, partnership, or limited company, we tailor strategies to ensure you’re taking full advantage of every tax break available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Financial Forecasting and Budgeting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A business without a plan is a business heading for trouble. With our financial forecasting and budgeting services, we help you plan for growth and anticipate challenges before they arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We create detailed financial models that project your business&#8217;s future performance based on different scenarios. This means you&#8217;re not just reacting to changes as they happen—you’re prepared for them. By aligning your financial goals with actionable insights, we empower you to stay agile and adapt to changes in the market, ensuring long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Scaling Your Business with Confidence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth is great, but without careful planning, scaling too quickly can cause chaos. Whether it’s hiring new staff, expanding into new markets, or increasing production, growth presents its own unique challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work alongside you to ensure that your business is scaling sustainably. From advising on funding options to assessing operational costs and pricing strategies, we help you expand without jeopardizing your existing business. Our team ensures that every move you make is backed by financial logic, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Digital Transformation and Automation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the digital age, businesses that fail to innovate risk falling behind. Accountants today can do much more than crunch numbers manually. We’re at the forefront of <strong>digital transformation</strong>, helping businesses adopt cloud-based accounting solutions and automation tools that save time, reduce errors, and provide real-time insights into your financial health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With automated processes and access to up-to-date financial data, you can make faster, more informed decisions that drive growth.

Business Structuring and Re-Structuring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of your business can have a massive impact on your tax obligations, legal liability, and overall profitability. We assist with setting up your business in the most efficient way, whether you’re just starting out or considering restructuring to support future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re moving from a sole trader to a limited company or exploring more complex structures like holding companies, our expertise will ensure that the transition is smooth and advantageous from a tax and legal perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Risk Management and Compliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While growth is exciting, it also comes with risks. As your accountants, we don’t just help you grow; we help you manage the risks associated with that growth. This includes ensuring that your financial controls are strong, your compliance with tax laws is sound, and your business is protected from any potential pitfalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By identifying financial risks early, such as rising costs, debt levels, or reliance on a few key clients, we help you mitigate them before they become a serious threat to your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Support with Funding and Investment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding your business often requires external funding, whether it’s through loans, investors, or grants. We can help you prepare your financial statements and business plans to present your business in the best possible light to potential investors or lenders. We also assist in finding and securing the right type of financing for your business, ensuring that the terms support your growth strategy without putting unnecessary strain on your finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Accountants as Partners in Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re only using your accountant to file your tax returns and keep your financials in order, you&#8217;re missing out on an invaluable resource.

      "content": "\n<p>In the intricate world of business formation, understanding the key documents that lay the groundwork for your company is essential. One such document is the <strong>Memorandum of Association (MoA)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we strive to equip you with the knowledge you need to navigate these waters confidently. Let’s delve into what the MoA is, what it includes, how it differs from the <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-are-articles-of-association/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"110\">Articles of Association</a> (AoA), and why it matters for your business!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a MoA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MoA is a foundational document required for the incorporation of a company in the UK. It acts as a declaration of the company’s structure and purpose at the point of registration. While its role has evolved since the Companies Act 2006, it remains a critical document that outlines the company’s existence and fundamental principles​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does the MoA Include?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MoA typically includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Company Name</strong>: The official name of the company as it will be registered;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Registered Office</strong>: The location of the company’s registered office, which must be in the UK;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company Objectives</strong>: A statement detailing the purposes for which the company is established. This could be broad, encompassing various activities the company intends to engage in; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Subscriber Details</strong>: The names and signatures of the initial shareholders (subscribers) who are forming the company, confirming their agreement to form the company and take shares​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does the MoA Not Include?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Memorandum serves as an essential document, it does not cover:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Operational Procedures</strong>: The day-to-day management practices of the company are not detailed in the Memorandum; these are typically found in the AoA; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Governance Rules</strong>: Specific guidelines on how the company will be run, including director responsibilities and shareholder meetings, are not included​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does the MoA Differ from AoA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Memorandum outlines the company’s existence and fundamental purposes, while the AoA provide the internal governance framework and rules for running the business​;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The Memorandum is largely fixed once the company is registered and cannot be easily changed. In contrast, the Articles can be amended through a special resolution by the shareholders​; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Content Focus</strong>: The Memorandum includes basic structural information about the company, while the Articles delve into governance, roles, and operational details​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tips for Managing Your MoA</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understand Its Role</strong>: Recognize that the Memorandum serves as a foundational document that informs stakeholders about your company’s existence and objectives​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consult Legal Experts</strong>: Work with a solicitor or business advisor to ensure your Memorandum complies with legal requirements and accurately reflects your company’s intentions​. Happy to make recommendations here!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep It Simple</strong>: While it’s important to be clear about your company’s objectives, avoid overly complex language. The clearer the Memorandum, the easier it is for stakeholders to understand your company’s purpose​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Document Changes Properly</strong>: If there are changes to your business structure or objectives, ensure that these are documented correctly, keeping in mind that the Memorandum cannot be easily altered​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retain Accessibility</strong>: Keep the Memorandum readily accessible for all shareholders and directors.

      "content": "\n<p>Running a fast-growing business is exhilarating. The orders are flying in, your team is expanding, and you’ve found a product or service that resonates with your market. Growth is a dream come true, but it can also be a time of uncertainty. What comes next to ensure this rapid growth translates into sustainable long-term success?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve helped countless businesses navigate these exciting but challenging times. Here are the key steps to take as you scale your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-role-of-an-accountant-in-business-growth-why-you-need-us-for-more-than-just-compliance/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"104\">business to ensure that growth</a> doesn’t just happen—it lasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Strengthen Your Financial Foundations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When growth hits, it’s easy to focus on the top-line figures—more revenue, more sales—but what’s happening beneath the surface matters just as much. Rapid growth can strain your finances if you don’t have a solid foundation in place. Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improve Cash Flow Management</strong>: Growth often brings increased expenses—bigger orders, new hires, more suppliers. Make sure your cash flow is steady so you don’t run out of working capital.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build Financial Reserves</strong>: Set aside a portion of your profits to act as a safety net. This will help you handle unexpected expenses or delays in payments from clients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Upgrade Your Accounting Software</strong>: With more transactions and more complexity, upgrading to more advanced accounting software (if you haven’t already) will help you stay on top of everything. Automation will save you time and reduce errors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to ensure that your finances are under control and you’re fully aware of what’s coming in and going out at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Plan for Scalable Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, you’ll need to start thinking long-term. You can’t just rely on the same strategies and processes that got you to this point. Ask yourself: Is my business built for scale?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Invest in Technology</strong>: Implementing cloud-based systems for accounting, payroll, inventory, and customer management ensures that your processes grow as your business does. Automation is key to managing large-scale operations efficiently.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hire the Right People</strong>: Your team is your greatest asset, but as you scale, the skills you need will evolve. Hiring the right people for the right roles—especially in leadership positions—will help you handle the increasing demands of a fast-growing business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop Standard Operating Procedures</strong> (SOPs): Document your processes so that they can be easily replicated by new team members. This helps maintain quality and efficiency as your business expands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling your business is not just about doing more of the same; it’s about strategically building the infrastructure needed to handle more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Manage Tax Efficiently</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, so too will your tax obligations. But with growth comes new <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"183\">opportunities to save on taxes</a> and increase profitability. Here’s how to stay tax-efficient while scaling:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Maximise Tax Reliefs</strong>: Take advantage of UK tax reliefs like the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA), which allows you to deduct up to £1 million on qualifying purchases like equipment and machinery.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider R&amp;D Tax Credits</strong>: If you’re innovating, research and development (R&amp;D) tax credits could significantly reduce your tax bill. Even small businesses that aren’t in tech or engineering may qualify if they’re solving technical problems or developing new processes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Structure Your Salary and Dividends</strong>: As a company director, consider how you’re paying yourself. A mix of salary and dividends can be more tax-efficient, allowing you to maximise your personal income while keeping your corporation tax bill down.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Proactively managing your tax obligations will keep more money in your business to fund future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Refine Your Business Strategy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth brings new opportunities, but it also demands a shift in strategy. Your current business model may have worked to get you this far, but now it’s time to assess where you want to go next:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reassess Your Market Position</strong>: Are you still serving the right audience, or has your market evolved? Take time to evaluate whether you need to expand into new markets, diversify your offerings, or reposition your brand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set New Goals</strong>: Create a roadmap that outlines your next growth phase. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Define key milestones, and build a strategic plan that aligns with where you want your business to be in the next 1, 3, or 5 years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Monitor Your Competition</strong>: As you grow, competitors will take notice. Keeping an eye on what they’re doing can give you insights into industry trends and help you stay ahead of the curve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying agile with a clear vision will enable you to continue capitalising on growth opportunities while staying competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Optimise Your Operational Efficiency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, inefficiencies can creep in, costing you time and money. It’s crucial to streamline your operations so your business can run smoothly at scale:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Outsource Non-Core Functions</strong>: While handling everything in-house may have worked when your business was smaller, outsourcing functions like payroll, IT support, or HR can free up valuable time for your core team to focus on growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Monitor Performance with KPIs</strong>: Implement key performance indicators (KPIs) across all areas of your business, from sales and marketing to operations and finance. Regularly reviewing these metrics will give you actionable insights into what’s working—and what’s not.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Supply Chain and Inventory Management</strong>: As you grow, your supply chain becomes more complex. Evaluate suppliers, optimise stock levels, and implement software solutions that help you track and manage inventory efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Operational efficiency is what turns short-term growth into long-term sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Protect Your Business with Risk Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapid growth can expose your business to new risks—financial, legal, or operational. It’s crucial to identify these risks early and put measures in place to protect your business:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review Your Insurance</strong>: Make sure you’re adequately insured. As your business grows, you may need to adjust your policies to cover new risks, such as public liability, professional indemnity, or employee-related insurance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strengthen Contracts and Agreements</strong>: As you engage with more clients, suppliers, and employees, ensure all agreements are watertight. It’s worth consulting a solicitor to review contracts and minimise the risk of disputes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: More growth often means more digital data—customer information, financial records, etc. As you scale, invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential threats and breaches.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Proactively managing risks allows you to grow with confidence, knowing your business is protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Get Expert Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger your business grows, the more complex the challenges you’ll face. You don’t need to do it alone. Surround yourself with experts who can provide guidance and help you navigate new obstacles, including, but not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Work with an Accountant</strong>: As experienced accountants, we can help you optimise your tax strategy, improve cash flow, and ensure you’re compliant with all regulations as your business scales, as well as giving you real business advice and support from experience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek Legal and HR Advice</strong>: As you expand, having expert legal and HR advice is crucial. Whether it’s managing employment law as your workforce grows or dealing with new contracts, seeking professional advice is a smart investment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider a Business Mentor or Coach</strong>: Sometimes, having an external perspective can help you see things you might overlook. A business mentor or coach can provide valuable insights and help you stay focused on your long-term goals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Take Your Growing Business to the Next Level?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth is exciting, but it’s not without its challenges.

      "content": "\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that self-employed professionals, freelancers, and business owners often face significant tax bills through Self-Assessment. But the good news is that there are several ways to reduce your Self-Assessment tax bill legally and efficiently. By being proactive and making use of available tax reliefs and deductions, you can keep more of your hard-earned money. Here are our top strategies to help you reduce your Self-Assessment tax liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Claim All Allowable Expenses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to reduce your tax bill is to ensure you’re claiming all eligible expenses. If you’re self-employed, you can deduct expenses that are <strong>wholly and exclusively</strong> for business purposes, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Office costs (e.g., rent, stationery, and utility bills)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel expenses (e.g., mileage, train fares, and accommodation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Professional fees (e.g., accounting and legal costs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketing and advertising costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business insurance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Equipment and technology purchases</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By keeping accurate records of your business expenses, you can significantly reduce your taxable profit and lower your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Maximise Your Tax-Free Allowances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you’re using all available tax-free allowances, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personal Allowance</strong> – You don’t pay tax on the first <strong>£12,570</strong> of your income (2024/25 tax year).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trading Allowance</strong> – If your self-employed income is below <strong>£1,000</strong>, you don’t need to register for Self-Assessment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividend Allowance</strong> – If you receive dividend income, the first <strong>£1,000</strong> is tax-free.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings Allowance</strong> – You can earn up to <strong>£1,000</strong> tax-free in interest (basic rate taxpayers).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Use the Marriage Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re married or in a civil partnership and your partner earns less than the <strong>Personal Allowance</strong>, you may be able to transfer <strong>£1,260</strong> of your unused allowance to them, reducing your tax bill by up to <strong>£252</strong> per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Contribute to a Pension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making contributions to a personal pension scheme can reduce your tax liability. You can contribute up to <strong>100% of your earnings</strong> (capped at £60,000 per year) and receive <strong>tax relief</strong> at your highest rate of income tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Claim Work From Home Expenses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work from home, you may be able to claim a proportion of your household costs, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Electricity and gas bills</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internet and phone bills</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mortgage interest or rent</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC allows a <strong>simplified expenses rate</strong> for home working or you can calculate the exact costs related to your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Invest in an ISA</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have savings or investments, consider using an <strong>Individual Savings Account (ISA)</strong>. You can invest up to <strong>£20,000 per year</strong> in an ISA, and any interest, dividends, or capital gains earned are tax-free. Depending on your amount of cash and risk appetite, there are also EIS, SEIS</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Plan for National Insurance Contributions (NICs)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employed individuals pay <strong>Class 2 and Class 4 NICs</strong>. To manage your liability:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep track of your profits</strong> to ensure you’re paying the correct amount.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider voluntary NIC payments</strong> if you have gaps in your NI record to protect your State Pension.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Make Charitable Donations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donating to charity via <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/gift-aid-explained-how-charitable-donations-can-reduce-your-tax-bill/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"70\">Gift Aid</a> allows you to claim tax relief. If you’re a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim <strong>25% tax relief</strong> on donations when filing your Self-Assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Defer Payments on Account</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your income has significantly reduced compared to the previous year, you may be able to <strong>reduce or defer your payments on account</strong>. This helps with cash flow and prevents overpaying tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Get Professional Tax Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to optimise your tax position is to <strong>work with a tax expert</strong>. At Black &amp; White Accounting, we specialise in helping self-employed professionals and business owners navigate Self-Assessment tax efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-Assessment <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"154\">tax planning</a> doesn’t have to be stressful.

These include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Staff wages and salaries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office rent and utilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Professional fees (e.g., accountants and solicitors)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketing and advertising costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel expenses</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By ensuring all allowable expenses are deducted before calculating taxable profits, you can significantly lower your corporation tax liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Make Use of Capital Allowances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you purchase assets such as machinery, vehicles, or office equipment, you can claim capital allowances. The <strong>Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)</strong> lets you deduct the full cost of qualifying purchases up to a certain limit, reducing your taxable profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Consider R&amp;D Tax Credits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business invests in innovation, research, or development, you could qualify for <strong>Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Tax Credits</strong>. This government scheme rewards businesses that create new products, processes, or services, allowing them to claim back a percentage of their R&amp;D expenditure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Pay into a Pension Scheme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributions to employee pension schemes are tax-deductible. Making employer pension contributions can reduce taxable profits while providing a valuable benefit for employees and potentially helping with staff loyalty and retention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Efficiently Structure Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your company structure is inefficient, you might be paying more tax than necessary. Consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Whether <strong>incorporating a holding company</strong> could provide tax advantages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether <strong>salary and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-talk-arctic-systems-can-you-still-split-dividends-with-your-spouse/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"5\">dividend splits</a></strong> for directors/shareholders could reduce liabilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using a <strong>group structure</strong> to offset losses between companies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is a <strong>limited company</strong> the right structure for you</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Use Losses to Your Advantage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business has made a loss, you can offset it against past or future profits. <strong>Carrying back losses</strong> to previous years can result in a tax refund, while <strong>carrying forward losses</strong> can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-reduce-corporation-tax/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"195\">reduce future corporation tax</a> liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Claim Tax Relief on Charitable Donations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business donates to charity, you can claim corporation tax relief on the amount donated. This not only benefits good causes but also helps lower your overall tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Review Director’s Remuneration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors should carefully consider how they take their earnings. A combination of <strong>salary, dividends, and benefits</strong> can be more tax-efficient than just taking a salary. Optimising director’s pay can help reduce personal and corporate tax liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Stay on Top of Deadlines and Compliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing tax deadlines can result in penalties and interest charges. Ensure you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>File corporation tax returns on time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pay any tax due promptly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep accurate records to support tax relief claims</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"155\">tax planning</a> can make a huge difference to your company’s bottom line. By implementing these strategies, you can reduce your corporation tax bill while staying fully compliant with HMRC regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping businesses maximise tax efficiency.

      "content": "\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that one of the biggest decisions facing new business owners is whether to operate as a sole trader or set up a limited company. Both options have their merits, but in many cases, being a sole trader is the better choice—especially for startups, freelancers, and small businesses. Let’s explore the pros and cons of both structures and why staying as a sole trader might be the smarter move for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Basics: Sole Trader vs. Limited Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>sole trader</strong> is the simplest and most common business structure in the UK. You are self-employed, and your business is not a separate legal entity. That means all profits go directly to you, but you are personally responsible for any business debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>limited company</strong>, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity from its owners. It has its own finances, pays its own taxes, and offers limited liability protection. However, it comes with more administrative responsibilities and potential tax implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Advantages of Being a Sole Trader</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Easy Setup &amp; Low Costs</strong> Setting up as a sole trader is quick, easy, and inexpensive. You only need to register with HMRC for self-assessment and start trading. There are no registration fees, complex paperwork, or ongoing compliance costs like there are with a limited company.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Less Admin, More Freedom</strong> As a sole trader, your accounting and reporting obligations are straightforward. You only need to complete a self-assessment tax return each year, unlike limited companies, which must file annual accounts and corporation tax returns with Companies House.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More Control Over Your Business</strong> As the sole decision-maker, you have complete control over your business operations. There are no directors or shareholders to answer to, allowing you to make quick decisions without bureaucracy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax Simplicity</strong> While limited companies pay corporation tax on profits, sole traders are taxed under self-assessment. This means you pay income tax and National Insurance on your earnings, but you avoid the complications of dividend tax, PAYE, and director salaries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Greater Privacy</strong> Limited companies must publish financial information on Companies House, meaning your business accounts are publicly available. Sole traders maintain greater privacy since their financials remain confidential.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Downsides of Being a Sole Trader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are plenty of advantages, there are also some drawbacks to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> If your business incurs debts or legal issues, you are personally liable, which means your personal assets (such as your home or savings) could be at risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Potentially Higher Tax Rates:</strong> Once your income reaches higher tax bands, you may pay more tax as a sole trader compared to a limited company.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Growth Potential:</strong> Sole traders may find it harder to raise investment or scale their business compared to limited companies, which can issue shares to investors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Is It Best to Remain a Sole Trader?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re just starting out, working as a freelancer, or running a small business with minimal risks, staying as a sole trader makes a lot of sense. Here’s when it’s a great option:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You expect relatively low profits in the early years (under £50,000 per year)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to keep costs and admin as low as possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You don’t need external investment or major financing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your business has minimal legal or financial risks</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Should You Consider a Limited Company?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While sole traders have many benefits, some situations make incorporation a better option:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>You’re Earning Over £50,000-£60,000:</strong> Once you start making significant profits, a limited company structure can help reduce tax liability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You Need Limited Liability Protection:</strong> If your business involves significant financial risk, a limited company can protect your personal assets.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You Plan to Expand or Take on Investors:</strong> If you aim to scale or attract investment, a limited company offers more credibility and options.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Verdict: Sole Trader or Limited Company?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many new businesses, starting as a <strong>sole trader</strong> is the best approach. It keeps things simple, affordable, and flexible while you establish your business. You can always incorporate later if your business grows and it makes financial sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we’re here to help you make the best decision for you and your business.

      "content": "\n<p>The allure of self-employment is undeniable—freedom, flexibility, and the ability to chart your own course. For many, making the leap into self-employment is the key to unlocking a lifestyle and career that truly aligns with personal goals and passions. But what are the specific advantages of being self-employed, and how can you make the most of them? In this blog, we’ll explore the benefits of self-employment and share tips on how to maximise your enjoyment of this exciting journey!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a UK accountancy practice supporting individuals and businesses, we’ve worked with countless self-employed professionals. Whether you’re already running your own business or thinking about making the switch, we’re here to help you thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Complete Control Over Your Work-Life Balance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest perks of being self-employed is the freedom to design your own schedule. No more 9-to-5 restrictions—your time is yours to manage! Whether you’re an early bird or a night owl, you can set your working hours to fit your personal life and priorities. Have a family? Being self-employed can offer the flexibility you need to attend school events or take holidays when you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Set Boundaries</strong>: It’s easy to get caught up in work when you’re self-employed, so it’s crucial to set clear boundaries between work and personal life. Schedule regular breaks, take time off, and don’t feel guilty about stepping away from work when you need it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embrace Flexibility</strong>: Take advantage of your ability to work from different locations—whether it’s from home, a café, or even while travelling. The world is your office!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Create a structured daily routine that balances productivity with personal downtime. Using productivity apps like Trello or Notion can help keep you organised while ensuring you maintain a healthy work-life balance.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The Opportunity to Follow Your Passion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being self-employed means you get to work on what you’re truly passionate about. No more mundane tasks imposed by someone else. Instead, you’re in the driver’s seat, choosing the projects, clients, and goals that align with your passions and values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Focus on What You Love</strong>: Make sure your business is built around something that excites you. When your work is driven by passion, it doesn’t feel like “work” anymore.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Delegate the Rest</strong>: Don’t get bogged down by tasks you don’t enjoy. Outsource tasks like accounting, admin, or IT support to free up time to focus on what you do best.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Regularly reflect on what makes you happy in your work and adjust your business activities accordingly. If something starts feeling like a chore, consider outsourcing or automating it.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Unlimited Earning Potential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re self-employed, there’s no salary cap! Your earning potential is directly tied to the effort and time you put into growing your business. Unlike a salaried job, where you’re paid a set wage, self-employment opens up opportunities for scaling your income based on performance, skills, and the demand for your services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Expand Your Services</strong>: To maximise your income potential, consider diversifying your offerings or tapping into new markets. For example, if you’re a graphic designer, you might add web design or branding packages to your services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increase Your Rates</strong>: Don’t be afraid to charge what you’re worth. As your expertise grows, so should your prices. Keep track of industry trends to ensure your rates are competitive but reflective of your value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Use accounting software like Xero, QuickBooks or FreeAgent to manage your finances efficiently and gain insights into cash flow and profitability. This will help you track your earnings and set income goals.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Tax Benefits and Financial Flexibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employment offers a range of tax benefits that salaried employees don’t have access to. From claiming business expenses to taking advantage of tax-deductible items, there are many ways to make the most of your financial situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tax Benefits Include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Claiming Expenses</strong>: As a self-employed individual, you can claim expenses such as home office costs, travel expenses, and equipment purchases, which can reduce your taxable income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexible Income</strong>: You have more control over your income flow, which allows for strategic <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"182\">tax planning</a> to reduce your overall tax burden.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep Detailed Records</strong>: Stay organised by keeping track of all your receipts and invoices. This will make it easier to claim expenses and maximise your tax savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consult an Accountant</strong>: Working with a tax professional ensures you don’t pay more tax than you need to. They can help with planning your finances and keeping your tax payments on track.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Set aside money for your tax payments in advance to avoid any financial surprises at the end of the year. Book keeping tools can help you track expenses and calculate your tax liabilities.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Creative and Professional Freedom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting advantages of self-employment is the creative freedom it offers. You get to choose how you run your business, which projects to take on, and how you deliver value to your clients. From branding decisions to innovative service delivery, you are free to let your creativity flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Experiment and Innovate</strong>: Don’t be afraid to try new approaches. Whether it’s launching a new product, tweaking your business model, or experimenting with different marketing strategies, self-employment allows you the space to take calculated risks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be Your Own Boss</strong>: Self-employment gives you the autonomy to make decisions quickly and efficiently. No waiting on approvals—if you see an opportunity, seize it!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Use project management tools like Asana or Monday.com to keep track of new ideas, business goals, and tasks. These platforms help you stay organised and agile as you grow.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Building a Personal Brand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re self-employed, you have the unique opportunity to build a personal brand. A strong personal brand can open doors to new opportunities, increase your visibility, and enhance your credibility in your industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Leverage Social Media</strong>: Use platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, or Twitter to build your online presence, showcase your work, and engage with your audience. Share your story, insights, and successes to grow your brand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Network and Collaborate</strong>: Networking is key to building a personal brand. Attend industry events, join online communities, and collaborate with other professionals to expand your reach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Build a professional website or portfolio to showcase your skills, services, and testimonials. A well-crafted online presence can be a powerful tool for attracting new clients.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Personal and Professional Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being self-employed is a journey of continuous learning. You’ll constantly pick up new skills, learn how to manage different aspects of a business, and grow both personally and professionally. The challenges you face along the way will help you become more resilient, adaptable, and innovative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Enjoy It:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Invest in Yourself</strong>: Take courses, attend workshops, and stay updated on industry trends. The more you invest in your skills, the more value you can provide to your clients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Celebrate Your Wins</strong>: Running a business can be challenging, but make sure to take time to celebrate your milestones, big or small. Reflecting on your achievements will keep you motivated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip: Set aside time each week to focus on your personal development. Whether it’s reading, learning a new skill, or attending a webinar, prioritising growth will keep you competitive and fulfilled.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What about the disadvantages of being self-employed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unpredictable Income</strong>: Your earnings can fluctuate, making financial planning more challenging.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lack of Benefits</strong>: No employer-provided benefits like pensions, health insurance, or paid holidays.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Responsibility</strong>: You handle everything—marketing, finance, and operations—on your own.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong>: Without boundaries, work can easily take over your personal life.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax Complexity</strong>: Managing taxes, accounting, and legal requirements can be time-consuming and complicated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, many find the benefits of self-employment well worth the trade-offs!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Make the Most of Your Self-Employment Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employment offers incredible advantages, from flexible working hours and unlimited earning potential to creative freedom and tax benefits. To fully enjoy these perks, it’s important to stay organised, plan strategically, and seek professional support when necessary. However, if you are not careful, you can end up as an employee to your new business, working for it, rather than it working for you. It is therefore really important to understand what you want to get out of being self-employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re here to help you navigate the financial and operational aspects of self-employment so you can focus on what you do best. Whether it’s tax advice, accounting software recommendations, or financial planning, to name but a few, we’ve got the expertise to support your success.

      "content": "\n<p>Expanding your business internationally is an exciting opportunity to reach new markets, increase revenue, and build global recognition for your brand. But for UK businesses, the idea of going global can feel daunting. From navigating international regulations to managing cross-border finances, there are plenty of challenges to overcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? You don’t have to be a big corporation to take your business beyond the UK. With the right strategy, even small businesses can successfully break into international markets. We specialise in helping businesses like yours plan for international growth. In this blog, we’ll take you through the key steps to expanding internationally and making your global ambitions a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Do Your Market Research</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into a new market, it’s essential to do your homework. You need to understand the demand for your product or service, your competition, and the unique challenges of operating in a foreign country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key areas to research include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Market demand</strong>: Is there a demand for your product or service in the target country? Look for gaps in the market or unmet needs that your business can fill.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural differences</strong>: Will you need to adapt your product, branding, or marketing strategy to suit local preferences?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Competition</strong>: Who are the local competitors, and how can you differentiate your business?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Regulations and laws</strong>: What are the legal requirements for doing business in the target country? This includes import/export regulations, business registration, and tax obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing time in market research helps you understand where the best opportunities lie and what potential hurdles you may face. Some countries are more welcoming than others!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Create an International Expansion Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding internationally requires a well-thought-out strategy. A solid international expansion plan will guide your actions and help you allocate resources efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you might want to include in your expansion plan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Target markets</strong>: Identify which countries or regions you want to expand into and why.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business model</strong>: Decide how you will enter the new market. Will you set up a physical presence, partner with a local distributor, or operate solely online?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pricing strategy</strong>: Consider local pricing dynamics, currency exchange rates, and costs involved in exporting goods or services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Budget</strong>: Outline the costs involved in expansion, including marketing, hiring local staff, logistics, and legal fees.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear plan not only sets you up for success but also helps you secure funding, if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Understand the Legal and Tax Implications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most complex aspects of expanding internationally is navigating the legal and tax systems of different countries. Every market has its own regulations, from business registration requirements to employment laws and tax rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key areas to consider include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Business structure</strong>: Will you need to register a new legal entity in the target country, or can you operate as a UK-based company?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax obligations</strong>: Understand the tax rules in both the UK and your target market. This includes VAT, import/export duties, and corporate taxes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employment laws</strong>: If you plan to hire local employees, make sure you understand the local labor laws, including minimum wage, employee rights, and payroll taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Partnering with an accountant who understands both UK and international tax laws can help you navigate these complexities and avoid costly mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Adapt Your Marketing for Local Audiences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding internationally means reaching a whole new audience, and your marketing strategy should reflect that. What works in the UK may not resonate in other countries, so it’s important to tailor your messaging and approach to each local market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tips for adapting your marketing include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Localise your content</strong>: Translate your website, social media, and marketing materials into the local language. But don’t just translate—make sure the messaging is culturally relevant.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use local platforms</strong>: In some markets, popular UK platforms like Facebook or Instagram may not be as widely used. Research which platforms are most effective in your target country.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leverage local influencers</strong>: Partnering with local influencers or industry leaders can help you build credibility and trust in a new market.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brand positioning</strong>: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities when promoting your brand. What works in one country could be seen as offensive or irrelevant in another.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailoring your marketing ensures that your brand resonates with local consumers and sets you apart from the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Develop a Local Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building relationships with local partners, suppliers, and customers is crucial when expanding internationally. Having a local network can help you navigate the business environment, understand cultural nuances, and establish a presence in the new market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ways to build a local network include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Attend trade shows and industry events</strong>: Trade shows can be a great way to meet potential partners, distributors, and customers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Join local business associations</strong>: These organisations can provide valuable resources and networking opportunities for foreign businesses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Partner with local experts</strong>: Consider working with local legal advisors, accountants, and consultants who understand the market and can help you avoid pitfalls.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong network gives you the support and insights you need to succeed in a new market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Manage Currency and Payment Systems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating in international markets means dealing with different currencies and payment systems. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact your profits, and you’ll need to ensure you offer payment methods that local customers trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currency and payment systems can be managed by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Setup multi-currency accounts</strong>: Having accounts in the local currency can help you avoid unnecessary exchange rate fees and streamline transactions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use hedging strategies</strong>: Hedging can help protect your business from currency fluctuations, especially if you’re dealing with large sums of money.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offer local payment methods</strong>: Research the preferred payment methods in your target market and offer options that local customers are familiar with, whether it’s credit cards, mobile payments, or local e-wallets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Properly managing currency and payments will help ensure smooth financial operations in your new market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Stay Compliant with International Accounting Standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding internationally means dealing with different accounting practices and regulations. To avoid complications, you need to ensure that your financial reporting meets both UK and local requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</strong>: Many countries follow IFRS for financial reporting. Make sure your accounts comply with these standards if applicable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consolidation of financial statements:</strong> If you have multiple entities in different countries, you may need to consolidate your financial statements for reporting purposes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cross-border taxation:</strong> Ensure that your business is structured in a way that minimises tax liabilities and avoids double taxation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an accountant who understands international accounting standards can help you stay compliant and avoid costly penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Expand Globally? We’re Here to Help!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding your business internationally is a bold and exciting move. It opens up new opportunities for growth, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.

Your State Pension is a key part of your retirement income, yet many people don’t fully understand how it works. In this essential guide, we’ll break down everything you need to know about the UK State Pension, including eligibility, payment amounts, and how to check if you have any gaps in your contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the State Pension?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/am-i-entitled-to-the-state-pension/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"124\">State Pension</a> is a regular payment from the government that you receive once you reach State Pension age. It is based on your National Insurance (NI) contributions throughout your working life. This pension provides a foundation for your retirement income, which you can supplement with private or workplace pensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Are You Entitled to the State Pension?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To receive the State Pension, you must have reached the official <strong>State Pension age</strong>, which varies depending on your date of birth. You can check your specific pension age on the UK government website. Generally, the State Pension age is currently 66, but it is set to increase in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Is the State Pension?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount you receive depends on your National Insurance record. As of the 2024/25 tax year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>full new State Pension</strong> is <strong>£203.85 per week</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>basic State Pension</strong> (for those who reached pension age before April 2016) is <strong>£156.20 per week</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify for the full new State Pension, you need <strong>35 years</strong> of NI contributions. If you have between 10 and 35 years, you will receive a proportion of the full amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Check Your National Insurance Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily check your National Insurance record online via the <strong>Check your State Pension Forecast</strong> tool on the UK government website. This will show:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How much State Pension you could receive</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your National Insurance record and how many years of contributions you have</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether you have any gaps in your NI contributions</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What If You Have Gaps in Your NI Record?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have gaps in your contributions, don’t worry—you may be able to <strong>top up your record</strong> by making voluntary NI contributions. You can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Make voluntary Class 3 National Insurance contributions</strong> to fill in missing years</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check if you’re eligible for National Insurance credits</strong>, for example, if you were a carer or on certain benefits</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>See if past employment or self-employment contributions were recorded correctly</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Boost Your State Pension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your forecast shows you won’t get the full State Pension, there are ways to improve it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Continue working and paying NI contributions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claim NI credits if eligible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make voluntary contributions to fill gaps</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The State Pension is based on your <strong>National Insurance contributions</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You need <strong>35 years</strong> of contributions to receive the <strong>full new State Pension</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can check your <strong>State Pension forecast</strong> online</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you have gaps, you may be able to <strong>make voluntary contributions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we can help you understand your pension situation and plan effectively for the future.

      "content": "\n<p>Charitable giving is a wonderful way to make a difference, but did you know it can also benefit your finances? In the UK, the <strong>Gift Aid</strong> scheme allows you to boost the value of your donations to charity and, in many cases, reduce your tax bill as a result. Whether you’re an individual taxpayer or a business, understanding how Gift Aid works could save you money while helping you give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog breaks down how Gift Aid works and how you can take full advantage of this scheme to reduce your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. What Is Gift Aid?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gift Aid is a UK government initiative designed to encourage charitable donations. When you donate to a charity as a UK taxpayer, the charity can claim an <strong>extra 25%</strong> on top of your donation at no extra cost to you. This means for every £100 you give, the charity receives £125!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not just the charities that benefit. As a taxpayer, you may be able to claim <strong>tax relief</strong> on your donations, particularly if you’re a higher-rate or additional-rate taxpayer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. How Gift Aid Works for Individuals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you make a donation to a registered UK charity and complete a Gift Aid declaration, the charity can claim <strong>basic rate tax relief (20%)</strong> on your donation. The great part is, if you’re a <strong>higher-rate</strong> (40%) or <strong>additional-rate</strong> (45%) taxpayer, you can claim back the difference between the basic rate and your personal tax rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Basic-rate taxpayers</strong>: No additional tax relief for you, but your donation is worth 25% more to the charity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher-rate taxpayers</strong>: You can claim back <strong>20%</strong> of the donation on your Self-Assessment tax return. For example, if you donate £100, the charity receives £125, and you can claim £25 back, reducing your tax bill.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Additional-rate taxpayers</strong>: You can claim back <strong>25%</strong>. For a £100 donation, the charity gets £125, and you can claim £31.25 back.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re employed under PAYE, you can adjust your tax code to account for Gift Aid donations, reducing the tax deducted from your salary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. How Gift Aid Works for Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses that donate to charity can also benefit from tax relief. However, the Gift Aid scheme itself is limited to individual taxpayers. For <strong>corporations</strong> or <strong>limited companies</strong>, donations to charity are typically treated as <strong>tax-deductible expenses</strong>, meaning they can <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/top-tips-for-reducing-corporation-tax/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"78\">reduce your <strong>corporation tax</strong></a> liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While businesses cannot claim Gift Aid, the donations can still reduce your taxable profits, allowing you to support charitable causes while improving your bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Maximising the Benefits of Gift Aid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most of Gift Aid, it’s important to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complete a Gift Aid declaration</strong>: Make sure to fill out a declaration form for each charity you donate to, so they can claim the additional 25% on your donation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep records of your donations</strong>: Whether you’re an individual or a business, keep a record of all donations made throughout the tax year to include in your Self-Assessment tax return or annual accounts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Track regular donations</strong>: If you make regular donations, such as through direct debit or payroll giving, you can adjust your tax code or Self-Assessment return to reflect these donations for additional tax relief.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Claiming Gift Aid on Past Donations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that you can claim Gift Aid on donations you’ve made in the past? HMRC allows you to backdate Gift Aid claims by up to <strong>four years</strong>. If you’ve donated to charities in the past but haven’t filled out a Gift Aid declaration, it’s worth reviewing your donations to see if you can retroactively claim tax relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Are You Eligible for Gift Aid?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify for Gift Aid, you must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be a <strong>UK taxpayer</strong> and have paid enough tax in the tax year to cover the amount that the charity will claim (20% on your donation); and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make donations to a registered UK charity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t pay enough tax to cover the Gift Aid claimed by the charity, HMRC may require you to pay the difference, so it’s important to monitor your total donations and tax liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Gift Aid for Higher and Additional Rate Taxpayers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those in higher tax brackets, Gift Aid offers a particularly valuable <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"152\">opportunity to reduce your tax</a> bill. Claiming back the extra 20% or 25% on your donations not only reduces your tax liability but also encourages greater charitable giving. With the tax savings, many higher earners can afford to give more without feeling the extra pinch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To claim your tax relief as a higher or additional-rate taxpayer, you’ll need to include your charitable donations on your <strong>Self-Assessment tax return</strong>. This is often overlooked, but it’s an easy way to reduce your tax bill while supporting the causes you care about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Boost Your Charitable Giving—Tax-Free!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best aspects of Gift Aid is that it allows you to make more of a difference with every donation. Not only do charities get more from your generosity, but you also benefit from potential tax savings. Whether you’re an individual taxpayer or a business looking to give back, understanding how Gift Aid works can help you make the most of your charitable donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: A Win-Win for You and Charities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gift Aid is an excellent way to increase the impact of your charitable donations and reduce your tax bill at the same time. For higher and additional-rate taxpayers, the tax relief on donations can make a huge difference in your tax, making it easier to support the causes you believe in. For businesses, charitable donations offer a tax-efficient way to contribute to society while keeping your profits healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about how Gift Aid can work for you or your business?</strong> Contact our team of experts today for personalised advice on charitable giving, Gift Aid, and tax-saving strategies.

      "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding CIS and Gross Payment Status with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work in the UK construction industry, you’ve likely heard of the <strong>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong> and <strong>Gross Payment Status (GPS)</strong>. But what do they really mean for your business, and how can they impact your cash flow, tax obligations, and overall financial health?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help construction professionals navigate the complexities of tax, ensuring they make informed decisions that benefit their business. In this blog, we’ll break down the essentials of CIS and Gross Payment Status, including who it applies to, the pros and cons, and how to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CIS is a special tax scheme for construction contractors and subcontractors, designed to ensure tax compliance and prevent underpayment. Under CIS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Contractors</strong> must deduct <strong>20% tax (or 30% if the subcontractor is not registered for CIS)</strong> from payments made to subcontractors and pass this directly to HMRC.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Subcontractors</strong> receive payments with tax deducted at source, which is then offset against their tax and National Insurance liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While CIS ensures tax compliance, it also means subcontractors receive payments with tax already deducted, potentially affecting their cash flow. This is where <strong>Gross Payment Status (GPS)</strong> comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Gross Payment Status (GPS)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gross Payment Status</strong> allows subcontractors to receive full payments from contractors <strong>without any tax deductions at source</strong>. Instead of having CIS deductions taken upfront, subcontractors are responsible for calculating and paying their <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"178\">tax at the end</a> of the financial year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a <strong>game-changer</strong> for cash flow, particularly for businesses that rely on steady income to cover expenses such as wages, materials, and equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Can Apply for Gross Payment Status?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS is <strong>not automatic</strong>—subcontractors must apply for it and meet HMRC’s strict eligibility criteria. To qualify, subcontractors must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Be registered for CIS</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prove a track record of tax compliance</strong>, including timely filing and payment of tax, National Insurance, and VAT.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Meet the business turnover threshold</strong>, currently requiring:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>£30,000 turnover</strong> for sole traders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>£30,000 per partner</strong> in partnerships.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>£100,000 turnover</strong> for limited companies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be running a business in the UK</strong> that carries out construction work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If a business meets these requirements, it can apply for Gross Payment Status through HMRC, but regular reviews ensure continued compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of Gross Payment Status</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying for GPS can offer significant benefits, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Improved Cash Flow</strong> – Receive full payments without upfront tax deductions, giving greater control over finances. ✅ <strong>Greater Financial Flexibility</strong> – Funds can be reinvested immediately in the business, helping with growth and expansion. ✅ <strong>Increased Credibility</strong> – Having GPS can enhance business reputation, making you more attractive to contractors. ✅ <strong>Potential for Tax Efficiency</strong> – Subcontractors can manage tax obligations more strategically, optimising deductible expenses before making tax payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages of Gross Payment Status</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While GPS can be advantageous, it’s not without its challenges:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Tax Responsibility</strong> – Subcontractors must set aside enough funds to cover tax bills, as payments will not have tax deducted at source. ⚠️ <strong>Stricter Compliance Requirements</strong> – HMRC monitors businesses with GPS closely, and failure to meet compliance standards can lead to removal from the scheme. ⚠️ <strong>Potential Large Tax Bills</strong> – Without careful planning, subcontractors could face significant end-of-year tax payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who struggle with budgeting for tax, GPS may not always be the best option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Apply for Gross Payment Status</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying for GPS is straightforward but requires careful attention to compliance. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Register for CIS</strong> – You must be registered as a subcontractor under CIS before applying for GPS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check Eligibility</strong> – Ensure your tax history is clean, with all returns and payments up to date.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apply Through HMRC</strong> – Applications can be made online or via phone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pass HMRC’s Review</strong> – HMRC will assess your tax record and business turnover before granting GPS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintain Compliance</strong> – If granted, ongoing compliance with tax obligations is essential to keep GPS status.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigating CIS and Gross Payment Status can be challenging, but <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> makes it simple. Our expert team can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Assess Your Eligibility for GPS</strong> – We evaluate whether your business meets HMRC’s criteria and advise on improving compliance if needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Help with Applications</strong> – We manage the entire GPS application process, ensuring it’s done correctly and efficiently.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimise Your Tax Strategy</strong> – With GPS, proper tax planning is essential—we help you manage cash flow and set aside the right amount for tax bills.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep You Compliant</strong> – Ongoing support ensures you meet HMRC’s strict requirements, avoiding penalties or GPS removal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For subcontractors in the construction industry, Gross Payment Status offers a way to <strong>boost cash flow, improve financial flexibility, and take control of tax obligations</strong>. However, it comes with responsibilities and risks that require expert financial management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we take the guesswork out of CIS and GPS, ensuring you get the most out of your earnings while staying compliant. <strong>Get in touch today</strong> and let’s build your business on solid financial ground!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unlocking the Potential of RSUs with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock-based compensation has become a powerful tool for attracting and retaining top talent, especially in fast-growing tech companies, multinational corporations, and start-ups. Among the various equity-based incentives, <strong>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)</strong> stand out as one of the most popular forms of employee rewards. But while RSUs can be lucrative, they also come with tax implications and potential pitfalls that many employees overlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we believe in breaking down complex financial topics so you can make informed decisions. In this blog, we uncover the <strong>truth behind RSUs</strong>—what they are, when to claim relief, key watch-outs, and how to optimise your stock-based compensation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RSUs are a type of stock-based compensation granted to employees as part of their pay package. Unlike stock options, RSUs are granted with no upfront cost to the employee. However, they come with a <strong>vesting period</strong>, meaning employees only gain full ownership of the shares after a specific time or upon meeting certain performance criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once RSUs <strong>vest</strong>, they convert into actual shares of company stock (or sometimes a cash equivalent). At this point, the value of the shares is treated as income and subject to tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Do RSUs Get Taxed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax treatment of RSUs depends on where you are based and your company’s policies, but generally, RSUs are taxed <strong>upon vesting</strong>, not when they are granted. Here’s how it typically works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>At Grant</strong> – No tax liability as RSUs are not yet yours.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>At Vesting</strong> – The market value of the shares on the vesting date is considered taxable income. Income tax, National Insurance Contributions (NICs), and potentially other levies apply.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>At Sale</strong> – If you later sell the shares, you may be subject to <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</strong> on any appreciation in value beyond the vesting price.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For those working internationally, <strong>Double Tax Relief (DTR)</strong> may apply if RSUs are taxed in multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When to Claim Relief on RSUs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RSU holders often miss out on valuable tax-saving opportunities. Here are a few ways to optimise taxation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Foreign Tax Credits</strong> – If your RSUs are taxed in multiple countries, you may be eligible for tax credits to avoid double taxation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilising Capital Gains Allowances</strong> – If you hold your RSU shares after vesting and they appreciate, planning your sale strategically can reduce CGT liability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spreading Sales Across Tax Years</strong> – Selling shares over multiple tax years can help stay within CGT-free thresholds and lower tax exposure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employer Withholding Strategies</strong> – Some companies allow employees to cover tax liabilities through <strong>sell-to-cover</strong> or <strong>cash payments</strong>—both of which impact how much of your RSUs you actually receive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Watch-Outs with RSUs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While RSUs offer great financial benefits, there are several important watch-outs to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Tax Burden at Vesting</strong> – If you’re unaware of tax implications, vesting could lead to an unexpected tax bill.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Market Volatility</strong> – RSU shares could lose value after vesting, reducing the actual benefit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employer Withholding May Not Cover Full Tax Liability</strong> – Many companies withhold only the minimum required tax, meaning employees might still owe additional tax when filing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Potential Double Taxation</strong> – If working abroad, RSUs might be taxed in both the country of employment and residence.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to plan for these scenarios can result in financial strain rather than a rewarding windfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing RSUs effectively requires careful <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"177\">tax planning</a>, especially if you work internationally or expect substantial stock-based income. At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we offer expert guidance to help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understand Your RSU Tax Position</strong> – We assess your tax obligations, including UK and international tax considerations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maximise Tax Efficiency</strong> – We help you take advantage of available reliefs, allowances, and tax-saving strategies, including claiming double tax relief.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plan for Future Gains</strong> – We advise on optimal times to sell, reinvest, or diversify to avoid concentrated stock risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ensure Compliance with HMRC</strong> – Our team handles tax filings and helps you avoid unexpected liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RSUs are a valuable part of modern compensation packages, but they come with tax complexities that can impact your financial well-being. With expert planning, you can ensure you <strong>maximise your earnings while minimising tax liabilities</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make tax planning clear, simple, and effective. <strong>Get in touch today</strong> and let’s make sense of your RSUs!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we love a good tax debate, and few are as famous (or delicious) as the Jaffa Cake case. This isn’t just about what you call your teatime treat—it’s a prime example of how tax law can have surprising financial consequences. So, let’s break it down: why did it matter, what was the outcome, and why do you need an expert like us in your corner?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jaffa Cakes - Cake or Biscuit? - Tax Talk Ep 1\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/imRxLG2wPpM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Issue: Why Does It Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For tax purposes, the difference between a cake and a biscuit isn’t just a matter of taste—it’s a matter of VAT (Value Added Tax). Under UK law:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cakes</strong> are zero-rated for VAT—meaning no extra tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Biscuits</strong>, on the other hand, are standard-rated <strong>if they are chocolate-covered</strong>, meaning they attract 20% VAT.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>McVitie’s, the makers of Jaffa Cakes, faced a battle with HMRC over whether their iconic treat should be classified as a biscuit (and therefore taxed) or a cake (and remain tax-free). With millions of pounds at stake, it wasn’t just a case of a name—it was a full-blown tax tribunal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Outcome: The £2M Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tribunal ultimately ruled in McVitie’s favour: <strong>Jaffa Cakes are cakes, not biscuits</strong>. The decision rested on several key factors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Jaffa Cakes have the <strong>same ingredients</strong> as a sponge cake.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They have a <strong>soft texture</strong>, rather than the snap of a biscuit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When they go stale, they <strong>go hard, like a cake</strong>—biscuits, in contrast, tend to go soft.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This ruling saved McVitie’s an estimated <strong>£2 million in VAT</strong> and remains one of the most famous tax cases in UK history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Is This Interesting?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This case highlights how <strong>tax law is full of complexities</strong>, often hinging on minute details that can have a <strong>huge financial impact</strong>. If something as small as a Jaffa Cake can spark a tax battle, imagine what’s at stake for your business!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Need an Accountant Like Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we know that <strong>tax isn’t just black and white</strong> (despite our name!). The Jaffa Cake case proves that <strong>interpretation matters</strong>, and having the right experts in your corner can save you significant money.

Whether you’re a business owner seeking more control over your pension or an individual looking for flexible retirement planning, a SSAS offers unique benefits that go beyond standard pensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about SSAS pensions—what they are, how they work, their advantages, disadvantages, and why they’re a smart choice for business owners and individuals alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a SSAS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Small Self-Administered Scheme</strong> (SSAS) is a type of workplace pension that’s typically set up by directors of small and medium-sized businesses. Unlike traditional pensions, a SSAS offers much more flexibility, especially for business owners who want to use their pension as part of their business strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SSAS pensions are usually established by limited companies and can have up to 11 members, who are often company directors or key employees. The members act as trustees, giving them full control over the scheme’s investments, which can include everything from shares and bonds to commercial property and even loans to the company itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does a SSAS Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A SSAS is designed to benefit both the business and its members. It allows business owners to pool pension funds, invest in a wide range of assets, and even provide loans back to the company. Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Establishment</strong>: A SSAS is usually set up by the company for the benefit of its directors and employees. The members act as trustees, giving them direct control over the pension’s investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contributions</strong>: Both the company and individual members can make contributions to the SSAS. Like other pensions, contributions qualify for tax relief, making it a tax-efficient way to save for retirement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investment Control</strong>: SSAS trustees have full control over where the pension fund is invested. This can include traditional assets like stocks and bonds, but also more business-oriented investments like commercial property or loans to the sponsoring company.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retirement Benefits</strong>: Once a member reaches the minimum pension age (currently 55, rising to 57 in 2028), they can start taking benefits from the SSAS. Like other pensions, up to 25% of the pension pot can be taken as a tax-free lump sum, while the remaining balance is drawn as taxable income.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why SSAS Is great for Business Owners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SSAS pensions offer significant advantages for business owners, making them one of the most flexible and tax-efficient pension schemes available. Here are some of the key reasons why SSAS might be a game-changer for your business:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Loan Back to the Business</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One of the most attractive features of a SSAS is the ability to loan money back to the sponsoring company. A SSAS can lend up to <strong>50% of its net assets</strong> to the business, providing a valuable source of funding for expansion, cash flow, or other business needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The business can access funds without the need for external financing, avoiding bank loans and high-interest rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The loan must be secured, and the repayment terms (interest-bearing and within five years) are clear, ensuring a structured and beneficial arrangement for both the business and the pension fund.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Investment in Commercial Property</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS pensions allow businesses to invest in <strong>commercial property</strong>. For business owners, this means that the SSAS can purchase the company’s premises, which the company can then lease back from the SSAS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rent paid by the company goes into the SSAS, growing the pension fund while being a <strong>tax-deductible expense</strong> for the business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any capital growth on the commercial property is free from <strong>capital gains tax</strong>, and rental income is free from <strong>income tax</strong>, making it a highly tax-efficient investment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Tax Relief on Contributions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Employer contributions to a SSAS are eligible for <strong>corporation tax relief</strong>, reducing the business’s overall tax liabilities while building pension savings for directors and key employees.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Personal tax relief</strong> is also available for individuals who contribute to the SSAS, with contributions qualifying for <strong>income tax relief</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The generous contribution limits, with an annual allowance of <strong>£60,000</strong> for 2024/25, allow businesses to maximise pension savings while enjoying tax advantages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Pooled Resources for Greater Investment Power</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A SSAS allows multiple members, such as directors, family members, and key employees, to pool their pension resources into one scheme. This creates a larger fund for investment, giving the business more flexibility and opportunities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pooling assets enables the SSAS to invest in larger projects, such as commercial property or more diversified investment portfolios, that might otherwise be unaffordable for individuals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Business Succession and Inheritance Planning</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS pensions are a valuable tool for <strong>succession planning</strong>, particularly in family-owned businesses. The SSAS can be passed down to the next generation, ensuring a smooth transfer of wealth and control.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Upon the death of a member, the SSAS can be passed on to beneficiaries (often family members) in a <strong>tax-efficient</strong> manner, without inheritance tax in many cases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This makes the SSAS an ideal structure for preserving business assets and ensuring continuity within family-owned or closely held businesses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Control Over Investment Decisions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unlike traditional pension schemes, where investment decisions are made by the pension provider, a SSAS gives business owners and trustees <strong>full control</strong> over the pension fund’s investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Business owners can actively manage the pension fund, making investment decisions that align with the company’s growth strategy or personal financial goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This control allows the trustees to adapt to changing business needs, market conditions, or investment opportunities as they arise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Flexible Contributions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS pensions offer flexibility in how and when contributions are made, which is especially useful for businesses with fluctuating income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The company can make larger contributions in profitable years and smaller or no contributions during leaner periods, offering flexibility to manage cash flow while building retirement savings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Diversification of Pension Assets</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS pensions allow trustees to invest in a wide range of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commercial property, and even private company shares. This provides a more diversified investment portfolio compared to traditional pension schemes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Diversifying the pension fund helps reduce risk and can improve returns over time, as trustees can invest in assets that match their risk tolerance and business strategy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investing in private company shares or other assets closely aligned with the business can provide additional growth opportunities for both the pension fund and the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. No Lifetime Allowance (from April 2024)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The UK government has abolished the <strong>lifetime allowance</strong> from April 2024, meaning businesses can contribute more into a SSAS without facing penalties for exceeding pension savings limits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Business owners with larger pension pots can continue growing their SSAS without worrying about additional tax charges, allowing for greater flexibility in retirement planning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Cost-Effective for Directors and Key Employees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS is often more cost-effective than setting up multiple individual pension schemes for directors or key employees. Since the SSAS is a single scheme for all members, the overall administration and management costs are often lower.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This cost efficiency makes SSAS an attractive option for businesses looking to provide a robust pension scheme for directors and top employees without incurring significant administrative costs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Tax-Free Growth on Investments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Any growth within a SSAS pension fund, such as capital gains from property or profits from investments, is <strong>tax-free</strong>. This allows the fund to grow more efficiently compared to investments outside of a pension wrapper.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantage</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The tax-free status of investments within the SSAS means that the fund can grow faster, providing a larger pension pot for members in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12. Personal and Business Wealth Management</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS allows business owners to align their personal wealth with their business’s growth strategy. Contributions made by the business directly benefit the pension savings of key employees and directors, creating a symbiotic relationship between the company’s performance and the growth of the pension fund.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This allows for long-term financial planning that integrates both personal and business goals, giving <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/a-look-into-the-future-will-business-britain-be-cashless/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"115\">business owners more control over their financial future</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why SSAS Is Great for Individuals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a business owner, a SSAS offers a range of benefits for individuals who want more control over their retirement savings. Here’s why SSAS might work for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Greater Control Over Investments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One of the main attractions of a SSAS is the <strong>control</strong> it offers over where and how your pension funds are invested. As a trustee of the scheme, you have the freedom to choose your investments, which could include:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Stocks and shares</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bonds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unit trusts and investment funds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commercial property</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Private company shares</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cash deposits</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This flexibility allows you to align your pension investments with your financial goals and risk tolerance, providing you with direct control over your retirement savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tax-Free Growth on Investments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Like other pension schemes, a SSAS allows for <strong>tax-free growth</strong> on your investments. This means any capital gains or income generated within the SSAS are free from capital gains tax and income tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The tax-free status of your investments helps your pension pot grow faster over time compared to taxable investments outside of a pension scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Wide Range of Investment Options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS offers a broader range of investment opportunities than most traditional pension schemes. You can invest in alternative assets like:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commercial property</strong> (e.g., office buildings or industrial units)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Private company shares</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Intellectual property</strong> (such as patents)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This wide range of investment options enables you to diversify your pension portfolio and take advantage of opportunities that suit your financial expertise or business interests.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Pension Consolidation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS allows you to consolidate multiple pensions into one scheme, making it easier to manage your retirement savings. If you have pensions from different employers or personal pensions, you can transfer them into your SSAS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Consolidating pensions provides a clear overview of your retirement savings and reduces the administrative burden of managing multiple pension schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Tax-Efficient Contributions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Contributions made to a SSAS are eligible for <strong>income tax relief</strong>, just like with other personal pensions. For the 2024/25 tax year, you can contribute up to <strong>£60,000</strong> annually, and you’ll receive tax relief on contributions up to this limit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This allows you to grow your retirement pot more efficiently while benefiting from tax relief on contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Investment in Commercial Property</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS allows you to invest in <strong>commercial property</strong>, which can be particularly attractive if you’re interested in property investment or already have expertise in this area.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any capital gains on the property and rental income are tax-free within the SSAS. Additionally, this provides an opportunity to diversify your pension portfolio by including real assets like property, which can offer long-term appreciation and income generation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Succession <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"176\">Planning and Inheritance Tax</a> Benefits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS is a valuable tool for <strong>inheritance planning</strong>. Upon your death, the assets in your SSAS can be passed on to your nominated beneficiaries, typically free from inheritance tax. Your SSAS can continue to provide benefits for future generations, allowing your wealth to be passed down in a tax-efficient manner.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: SSAS offers a way to protect your wealth and ensure it can be inherited by your loved ones without the burden of heavy taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Tax-Free Lump Sum</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>When you reach the minimum retirement age (currently 55, rising to 57 in 2028), you can withdraw up to <strong>25%</strong> of your pension pot as a <strong>tax-free lump sum</strong>. The remaining 75% can be used to provide an income in retirement, which will be taxed at your marginal rate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The tax-free lump sum provides financial flexibility and can be used to fund major life events or invest in other opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Pooling Resources with Family Members</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS allows you to <strong>pool resources</strong> with other members, such as family members, to create a larger pension pot. If multiple family members are part of the SSAS, you can combine funds to make bigger investments, such as purchasing commercial property.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Pooling assets with family members provides access to more significant investment opportunities and allows for a collaborative approach to managing family wealth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Flexible Contributions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SSAS offers flexibility in how and when you make contributions. You can adjust your contributions depending on your financial situation, making it particularly useful if you have fluctuating income or want to make lump-sum contributions in good financial years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The ability to vary contributions makes SSAS adaptable to your changing financial circumstances, allowing you to optimise your pension savings over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Control Over Retirement Income</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>With SSAS, you have control over how and when you access your pension during retirement. You can choose to take your pension as a lump sum, regular income, or a combination of both, offering <strong>flexibility</strong> to meet your retirement needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: This flexibility allows you to manage your withdrawals in a tax-efficient manner, reducing the risk of being pushed into higher tax brackets unnecessarily.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12. No Lifetime Allowance (from April 2024)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>From April 2024, the UK government has abolished the <strong>lifetime allowance</strong>, meaning there is no longer a limit on the amount you can accumulate in your SSAS without facing tax penalties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can grow your SSAS pension fund without worrying about breaching a lifetime allowance limit, providing more flexibility for long-term pension growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Potential Drawbacks of SSAS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While SSAS pensions offer plenty of advantages, they aren’t without their potential downsides. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Complexity and Administrative Burden</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Trustee Responsibilities</strong>: As a SSAS trustee, you are responsible for managing the scheme and ensuring it complies with UK pension regulations. This can be time-consuming and requires a good understanding of pension laws and investment management.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing Administration</strong>: A SSAS requires more administrative effort than traditional pension schemes, including regular reporting to HMRC, maintaining investment records, and ensuring the scheme adheres to pension rules. Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Higher Setup and Running Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Initial Setup Costs</strong>: Establishing a SSAS can be more expensive than setting up a standard pension scheme due to the legal and professional advice needed during the setup process. You may need to engage with accountants, lawyers, and pension advisors, which can increase initial costs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing Costs</strong>: In addition to setup fees, there are ongoing costs associated with managing a SSAS, such as administration fees, trustee fees, and costs related to compliance and reporting. For smaller pension pots, these costs can erode investment returns.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Investment Risk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Investment Choices and Responsibility</strong>: While SSAS provides more control over investments, it also exposes you to more risk. The value of your investments can go down as well as up, and poor investment decisions can lead to significant losses. As a trustee, you bear the responsibility for making sound investment decisions, which may not always align with your risk tolerance or expertise.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Concentration Risk</strong>: Investing in assets such as commercial property or private company shares can be risky, especially if the pension fund becomes overly reliant on a few large investments. For example, if you invest heavily in commercial property and the market declines, your entire pension pot could suffer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Complexity of Loans to the Sponsoring Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Loan Repayment Risk</strong>: One of the unique features of a SSAS is its ability to loan money to the sponsoring company. However, this comes with risk. If the company experiences financial difficulties and cannot repay the loan, the SSAS could suffer significant losses, potentially jeopardising the retirement savings of the members.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strict Loan Conditions</strong>: HMRC sets strict conditions for SSAS loans to the sponsoring company, including that the loan must be secured, repaid within five years, and carry a commercial interest rate. Failing to meet these conditions can lead to severe tax penalties for both the business and the pension scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Regulatory and Compliance Risks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complex Compliance Requirements</strong>: SSAS schemes must comply with a range of pension regulations, and failure to do so can result in hefty penalties from HMRC. The trustees are responsible for ensuring the scheme meets all regulatory requirements, which can be difficult to navigate without professional advice.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Penalties for Non-Compliance</strong>: If HMRC finds that the SSAS has breached pension regulations (e.g., by making unauthorised payments or failing to follow loan rules), the scheme could face severe tax penalties, and the trustees could be personally liable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Limited Member Base</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Restricted to 11 Members</strong>: A SSAS can have a maximum of 11 members. While this is usually sufficient for small and medium-sized businesses, it can be limiting for larger companies or businesses that want to include a broader range of employees in their pension scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Investment Restrictions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Residential Property Investment</strong>: While SSAS schemes offer a wide range of investment options, they cannot invest in residential property directly. This limits potential investment opportunities in what is often considered a popular and stable asset class.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Personal Benefit</strong>: Investments made through the SSAS must not provide personal benefit to the members or their families. For example, you cannot use a commercial property owned by the SSAS for personal purposes. Breaching this rule can lead to significant tax penalties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Liquidity Issues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Illiquid Assets</strong>: Many of the investments commonly made by SSAS schemes, such as commercial property or private company shares, are illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily sold or converted into cash. This can be problematic if you need to access pension funds quickly or if the scheme needs to liquidate assets to meet liabilities, such as paying member benefits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Cash Flow</strong>: If your SSAS is heavily invested in assets like property, which may not generate regular income, it could face cash flow challenges, particularly if the scheme needs to pay out pensions to its members.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Potential Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Business and Pension Goals</strong>: When a SSAS lends money to the sponsoring company or invests in company assets, there is a risk that the business&#8217;s financial needs may conflict with the long-term goals of the pension scheme. Trustees must be careful to balance the interests of the business with the duty to grow and protect members&#8217; pension savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Long-Term Commitment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Difficulty in Winding Up</strong>: A SSAS is a long-term commitment, and winding up the scheme can be a complex and costly process. If the business closes or if the trustees no longer want to manage the SSAS, unwinding the scheme requires legal and financial advice, and there may be tax implications to consider.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Potential for Underperformance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lack of Professional Management</strong>: While SSAS provides control over investments, not all trustees have the expertise to manage investments effectively. If the trustees lack the knowledge or resources to manage the scheme properly, the pension fund could underperform compared to professionally managed pension schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is a SSAS Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A SSAS can be an excellent option for business owners looking for a flexible, tax-efficient way to grow their pension and benefit their company at the same time. The ability to lend money back to the business, invest in commercial property, and enjoy tax-free growth makes SSAS one of the most powerful pension tools available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals, SSAS pensions offer unparalleled investment control and tax benefits, allowing for a more tailored approach to retirement planning. However, SSAS pensions are not suitable for everyone. They require active management and a good understanding of investment and pension rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Take Control of Your Pension?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we specialise in helping business owners and individuals make the most of their retirement savings.

That’s where <strong>Double Tax Relief (DTR)</strong> comes in—a crucial mechanism designed to prevent unfair double taxation on international earnings. Whether you’re a business with global operations, an expat earning across borders, or an investor receiving foreign dividends, understanding DTR is key to ensuring you’re not paying more than you should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in simplifying complex tax matters. In this blog, we’ll break down the <strong>where, when, and how</strong> of Double Tax Relief and how you can benefit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Double Tax Relief?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Double Tax Relief (DTR) is a provision designed to prevent individuals and businesses from being taxed twice on the same income in different jurisdictions. Many countries, including the UK, have Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with other nations to ensure fair taxation and provide mechanisms to offset or exempt taxes paid abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DTR generally applies in two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax Credit Relief</strong> – You pay tax in one country and receive a credit against your tax liability in your home country.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax Exemption Relief</strong> – Your income is taxed in one country and exempt from tax in your home country.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This relief ensures that global taxpayers, from digital nomads to multinational corporations, do not face excessive tax burdens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Does Double Tax Relief Apply?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DTR is relevant when you earn income in a foreign jurisdiction that also seeks to tax your earnings. Here are common scenarios where it applies:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Working Abroad</strong> – If you are a UK resident working overseas and subject to foreign income tax, you may claim DTR to avoid double taxation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overseas Property Rentals</strong> – If you earn rental income from property in another country, you may be taxed in that country as well as in the UK.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Foreign Dividends</strong> – If you receive dividends from international investments, the foreign country may withhold tax on those earnings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multinational Businesses</strong> – If a company operates across borders, it may face corporate tax obligations in multiple jurisdictions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding your tax residency status is crucial. The UK operates on a <strong>statutory residence test</strong> to determine whether you are liable for tax on worldwide income or only on UK-based earnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Claim Double Tax Relief?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming DTR depends on the tax treaty between the UK and the relevant foreign country. The process typically involves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Check the Tax Treaty</strong> – The UK has DTAs with over 130 countries. These agreements outline how tax is allocated between jurisdictions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Calculate Your Relief</strong> – Determine the tax paid abroad and whether you qualify for a tax credit or exemption in the UK.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use the Right Forms</strong> – HMRC provides specific forms for claiming DTR, such as the <strong>Foreign Tax Credit Relief (FTCR)</strong> claim on a self-assessment tax return.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep Documentation</strong> – You’ll need proof of foreign tax payments, including payslips, tax returns, and withholding tax certificates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit Your Claim</strong> – Include your DTR claim when filing your UK tax return to ensure you receive the correct relief.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to claim DTR can lead to unnecessary tax payments and missed refunds, so expert guidance is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real-Life Example of Double Tax Relief in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine Jane, a UK resident, working remotely for a US-based company. The US employer withholds tax on her salary, and she also has UK tax obligations. Thanks to the UK-US Double Tax Agreement, Jane can claim <strong>Foreign Tax Credit Relief</strong>, offsetting US tax paid against her UK tax bill, ensuring she doesn’t pay tax twice on the same income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, a UK-based investor receiving dividends from a company in Germany can claim a tax credit for the German withholding tax, reducing their UK tax liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigating international taxation and Double Tax Relief can be daunting, but that’s where <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> steps in.

If you run a business and use vehicles for work, you might assume that a <strong>Double Cab Pickup</strong> (DCP) is a commercial vehicle and should be taxed as one. But HMRC doesn’t always see it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax treatment of these vehicles is <strong>hugely important for VAT, benefit-in-kind (BIK), and capital allowances</strong>. And the wrong classification could <strong>cost your business thousands</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is a <strong>Double Cab Pickup a car or a commercial vehicle</strong>? Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Issue: Why Does Vehicle Classification Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In tax law, <strong>vehicles are classified differently depending on their use</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cars</strong> are subject to <strong>higher tax rates</strong> for businesses and individuals. Employees using company cars for personal use face <strong>higher BIK tax charges</strong>, and VAT on cars is <strong>usually non-reclaimable</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Commercial Vehicles</strong> (like vans, trucks, and pickups) <strong>qualify for VAT recovery</strong>, benefit from <strong>lower tax rates</strong>, and are more tax-efficient for businesses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem? The <strong>Double Cab Pickup sits in a grey area</strong>—because it has <strong>two rows of seats and can carry passengers like a car, but also has a truck bed for business use</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, businesses <strong>classified these vehicles as commercial</strong>, allowing them to claim VAT back and take advantage of <strong>lower tax rates</strong>. But then HMRC stepped in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Outcome: HMRC’s Surprise Ruling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, HMRC <strong>reclassified certain Double Cab Pickups as cars</strong>, specifically targeting models like the <strong>VW Amarok and Toyota Hilux</strong>. This decision <strong>reversed decades of tax treatment</strong> and sent shockwaves through businesses that relied on these vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key ruling:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>If a DCP has a payload of less than 1 tonne</strong>, it is now <strong>considered a car for tax purposes</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If it has a payload over 1 tonne</strong>, it remains a <strong>commercial vehicle</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, this means:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If your DCP is now classed as a car:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>VAT <strong>cannot</strong> be reclaimed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher benefit-in-kind tax</strong> applies to employees.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Less favorable capital allowances</strong> reduce tax relief.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If your DCP remains a commercial vehicle:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>VAT can still be reclaimed</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lower benefit-in-kind tax</strong> applies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better capital allowances</strong> are available for tax savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The reclassification <strong>hit many businesses hard</strong>, leaving them with unexpected tax liabilities and <strong>forcing companies to rethink their vehicle choices</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 2025 Rule Change: The Final Verdict?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC has confirmed that <strong>Double Cab Pickups will be taxed as cars from April 2025</strong>, following the latest <strong>Budget announcement</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change, outlined in the <strong>Budget Red Book</strong>, reverses earlier decisions that caused uncertainty over the taxation of these vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, HMRC had <strong>briefly classified Double Cab Pickups as cars in early 2024</strong>, only to <strong>revert to van status a week later</strong>. The reclassification now stems from the <strong>2020 Court of Appeal case, Payne &amp; Ors (Coca-Cola) vs R &amp; C Commrs</strong>, which questioned the tax treatment of vehicles with a payload of one tonne or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Under the new rules:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Double Cab Pickups will be treated as cars for corporation tax from 1 April 2025</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>They will also be taxed as cars for income tax from 6 April 2025</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This change will affect <strong>capital allowances, benefits in kind, and certain business deductions</strong>. However, <strong>transitional arrangements</strong> will allow employers who <strong>purchase, lease, or order these vehicles before the cut-off date</strong> to continue benefiting from the <strong>previous tax treatment until 2029</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC has indicated that this ruling is aimed at <strong>ensuring consistency in tax treatment across similar vehicles</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Is This Interesting?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This case highlights just how <strong>complicated and ever-changing tax law can be</strong>—especially when it comes to business expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>vehicle that was tax-efficient one year might not be the next</strong>, meaning businesses must stay on top of HMRC’s rulings to avoid costly surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <strong>own or lease company vehicles</strong>, it’s critical to understand <strong>how tax laws impact your bottom line</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Need an Accountant Like Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we don’t just look at your numbers—we help you <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"150\">plan strategically</strong> to <strong>minimise tax</a> and maximise business efficiency</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Classify your company vehicles correctly</strong>—so you don’t get hit with unexpected VAT or BIK tax bills.<br>✅ <strong>Maximise tax reliefs</strong>—by advising on the best way to structure vehicle purchases and leases.<br>✅ <strong>Stay ahead of HMRC rule changes</strong>—so you don’t get caught out by shifting tax classifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use company vehicles for business, you need a tax strategy that <strong>works for you, not against you</strong>.

      "content": "\n<p>Value Added Tax (<strong>VAT</strong>) is a crucial part of running a business in the UK, but <strong>choosing the right VAT scheme</strong> can be confusing. The scheme you select can <strong>impact your cash flow, admin workload, and even how much VAT you pay</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make VAT <strong>simple, stress-free, and tailored to your business needs</strong>. Whether you’re a <strong>small startup, freelancer, or growing enterprise</strong>, here’s your <strong>ultimate guide to VAT schemes</strong>, why they exist, and how to <strong>choose the best one for you</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Brief History of VAT in the UK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT was introduced in the UK in <strong>1973</strong>, replacing Purchase Tax. It was designed to be a <strong>fairer, consumption-based tax</strong> on goods and services. Today, VAT is one of <strong>HMRC’s biggest revenue streams</strong>, contributing billions to public services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its introduction, different VAT schemes have been developed to help businesses <strong>manage their VAT obligations efficiently</strong>, particularly smaller businesses that may struggle with administrative burdens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is VAT and Why Does It Exist?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT is a <strong>consumption tax</strong> that businesses collect on behalf of HMRC. If you are VAT-registered, you must <strong>charge VAT on sales</strong>, but you can also <strong>reclaim VAT on eligible business expenses</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>VAT Registration Threshold (2024/25):</strong> £90,000 📌 <strong>Standard VAT Rate:</strong> 20% 📌 <strong>Reduced VAT Rate:</strong> 5% (e.g., home energy, children’s car seats) 📌 <strong>Zero-Rated Goods:</strong> 0% (e.g., most food, books, children’s clothing)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which VAT Scheme is Best for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several VAT schemes, each designed to suit different types of businesses. Here’s a breakdown of the most common ones:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Standard VAT Accounting Scheme (The Default Option)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Suitable for <strong>most businesses</strong> with VAT registration. ✅ You <strong>charge VAT on sales and reclaim VAT on expenses</strong>. ✅ VAT returns must be submitted <strong>quarterly</strong>. ✅ You must <strong>pay VAT to HMRC even if invoices haven’t been paid yet</strong>. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses with stable cash flow that can manage regular VAT payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Flat Rate VAT Scheme (FRS) – Simplify Your VAT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Designed for <strong>small businesses</strong> with turnover up to <strong>£150,000</strong>. ✅ Instead of reclaiming VAT on purchases, you <strong>pay a fixed percentage of turnover</strong>. ✅ The <strong>percentage varies by industry</strong> (e.g., IT consultants pay 14.5%, restaurants pay 12.5%). ✅ <strong>First-year discount:</strong> 1% reduction in the VAT rate for new VAT-registered businesses. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses with <strong>low expenses</strong>, service-based industries, and freelancers who want <strong>simpler VAT reporting</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Cash Accounting VAT Scheme – Improve Your Cash Flow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ You <strong>only pay VAT to HMRC when you receive payments from customers</strong> (instead of when you issue invoices). ✅ Helps with <strong>cash flow</strong>, especially if customers take time to pay. ✅ Must have an <strong>annual turnover below £1.35 million</strong> to join. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses that experience <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/late-payments-are-hurting-my-sme-what-can-i-do/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"87\">late payments</a></strong> or want to improve <strong>cash flow</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Annual Accounting VAT Scheme – Reduce Admin Burden</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Instead of quarterly VAT returns, you <strong>submit one return per year</strong>. ✅ Make <strong>monthly or quarterly VAT payments</strong>, then submit a final balance payment. ✅ Helps <strong>spread VAT payments evenly</strong> throughout the year. ✅ Only available to businesses with <strong>turnover below £1.35 million</strong>. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses that <strong>prefer predictable VAT payments</strong> and less frequent admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. VAT Margin Scheme – Ideal for Second-Hand Goods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Used for <strong>second-hand goods, antiques, and works of art</strong>. ✅ You <strong>only pay VAT on the profit margin</strong> (not the full selling price). ✅ Simplifies VAT for businesses dealing in <strong>reselling items</strong>. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Second-hand retailers, car dealerships, art dealers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Retail VAT Schemes – Perfect for Shops</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Designed for <strong>retailers</strong> who sell a high volume of <strong>low-value goods</strong>. ✅ Different methods available:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Point of Sale Scheme:</strong> Calculate VAT at the point of sale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apportionment Scheme:</strong> Used when buying stock with different VAT rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Direct Calculation Scheme:</strong> Calculate VAT based on sales records. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Retail businesses needing <strong>efficient VAT tracking</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. VAT Reverse Charge Scheme – For the Construction Industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Applies to VAT-registered businesses in the construction industry</strong>. ✅ The <strong>customer (not the supplier) pays the VAT directly to HMRC</strong>. ✅ Affects contractors and subcontractors under the <strong>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong>. 📌 <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses operating in <strong>construction and building services</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making Tax Digital (MTD) and VAT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In 2019, the UK government introduced Making Tax Digital (MTD), requiring VAT-registered businesses to keep digital records and submit VAT returns through MTD-compatible software. This was designed to reduce errors and streamline tax administration.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ MTD is mandatory for all VAT-registered businesses. </strong><strong>✅ Businesses must use approved accounting software like Xero, QuickBooks, and FreeAgent. </strong><strong>✅ Manual record-keeping and paper VAT returns are no longer compliant with MTD.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you’re unsure about how to switch to MTD-compliant bookkeeping software, Black &amp; White Accounting can help you get set up!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which VAT Scheme Should You Choose?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>best VAT scheme</strong> depends on: 🔹 <strong>Turnover</strong> – Some schemes are limited to businesses below a certain threshold. 🔹 <strong>Industry</strong> – Some industries benefit from specific schemes (e.g., second-hand goods, construction). 🔹 <strong>Cash Flow Needs</strong> – If cash flow is a concern, <strong>Cash Accounting</strong> or <strong>Flat Rate</strong> may be beneficial. 🔹 <strong>Admin Preferences</strong> – If you want less frequent reporting, <strong>Annual Accounting</strong> may be ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still unsure? <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> can help assess your <strong>business structure, cash flow, and industry needs</strong> to find the <strong>perfect VAT scheme for you!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT can be complex, but <strong>we make it easy</strong>.

One of the biggest UK business tax cases in recent years involved <strong>Pimlico Plumbers</strong>, a battle that reshaped how companies classify their workers and, crucially, how much tax they owe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case highlights how <strong>misclassifying workers can lead to unexpected tax bills, legal battles, and financial headaches</strong>. Whether you run a business that relies on contractors or you’re a freelancer yourself, <strong>this ruling could affect you</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break down the case and why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Issue: Self-Employed Contractors or Workers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Pimlico Plumbers engaged its tradespeople as <strong>self-employed contractors</strong>, meaning:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔹 They weren’t entitled to holiday pay, sick pay, or other employee benefits.<br>🔹 They <strong>paid their own tax and National Insurance (NI)</strong>, rather than Pimlico handling PAYE.<br>🔹 The company <strong>avoided employer NI contributions and other employment costs</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one ex-plumber, <strong>Gary Smith</strong>, challenged this classification. He argued that, despite being labelled as self-employed, <strong>he worked exclusively for Pimlico, wore their uniform, drove their branded vans, and had strict working conditions</strong>—making him more of an <strong>employee or &#8220;worker&#8221;</strong> under UK law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC and employment tribunals saw this as a <strong>clear case of false self-employment</strong>, which could have serious tax and employment law implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Outcome: A Landmark Ruling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <strong>landmark Supreme Court ruling</strong>, Pimlico Plumbers <strong>lost their case</strong>. The courts ruled that <strong>Gary Smith was a worker, not a fully self-employed contractor</strong>, because:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ He was <strong>required to work personally</strong>—he couldn’t send a substitute.<br>✅ Pimlico <strong>exercised significant control</strong> over his schedule, uniform, and conduct.<br>✅ He was <strong>economically dependent</strong> on Pimlico rather than being a truly independent business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does this mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1️⃣ <strong>Employment Rights:</strong> Smith (and potentially others in similar roles) <strong>were entitled to employment benefits</strong> such as holiday pay and pension contributions.<br>2️⃣ <strong>PAYE &amp; National Insurance:</strong> Pimlico could be <strong>liable for backdated employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs)</strong>.<br>3️⃣ <strong>Corporation Tax &amp; Business Models:</strong> Businesses relying on <strong>self-employed contractors may need to rethink their structure</strong> to avoid tax and employment law breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ruling set a <strong>powerful precedent</strong>, influencing <strong>gig economy cases</strong> (like <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/youtube-script-ubers-500-million-tax-fight-and-what-it-means-for-your-business/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"7\">Uber</a> and Deliveroo) and putting businesses on notice that <strong>contractor models must be carefully managed</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Is This Interesting?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is a <strong>wake-up call for businesses relying on freelancers and contractors</strong>. If you engage workers in a similar way, you could <strong>face surprise tax bills, legal claims, or even penalties from HMRC</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>employment status vs self-employment debate</strong> is only getting tougher, especially with HMRC tightening <strong>IR35 rules</strong> and cracking down on companies using &#8220;false self-employment&#8221; to reduce tax bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, getting this wrong means:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🚨 <strong>Backdated PAYE and National Insurance demands</strong>.<br>🚨 <strong>Fines and penalties for incorrect tax treatment</strong>.<br>🚨 <strong>Legal disputes from contractors seeking employment rights</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For contractors, it raises questions like:<br>❓ <strong>Am I truly self-employed, or could I be classified as a worker?</strong><br>❓ <strong>Am I paying too much tax under an incorrect classification?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case proves that <strong>how you structure your workforce directly affects your tax liabilities</strong>—and one wrong move can be <strong>very costly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Need an Accountant Like Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses and contractors <strong>get employment status and tax right the first time</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We assist with:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Employment status reviews</strong>—ensuring your workforce is classified correctly.<br>✅ <strong>Corporation tax and PAYE planning</strong>—so you stay compliant while minimising tax exposure.<br>✅ <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/ir35-rules-how-they-affect-contractors-and-freelancers-in-the-uk/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"60\">IR35</a> and contractor agreements</strong>—helping businesses and freelancers navigate complex rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Whether you run a business that hires contractors or you’re self-employed yourself, we’ll make sure you don’t get caught out by shifting tax laws.</strong> 📞 <strong>Need expert tax advice?

      "content": "\n<p>In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, managing financials is often the last thing entrepreneurs want to focus on. Yet, it&#8217;s crucial. If you&#8217;re running an e-commerce business you know how complex reconciling marketplace transactions can get. That&#8217;s where <strong>A2X</strong> comes in—a powerful tool designed to make your accounting as seamless as your sales. But is A2X the right fit for your business? Let’s dive in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is A2X?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A2X is an accounting automation software that integrates with popular e-commerce platforms like <strong>Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, Walmart, and eBay</strong>, simplifying the complex task of accounting for online sales. It automatically imports transactions, breaking down your sales, fees, refunds, and taxes, and organizes them into neat, easily understandable reports. A2X integrates directly with cloud accounting software like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks</strong>, and <strong>Sage</strong>, making reconciliation a breeze and giving you more time to focus on growing your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why E-commerce Clients Love A2X</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For e-commerce businesses operating in the UK, where VAT compliance and accounting accuracy are critical, A2X offers a much-needed solution. It ensures that all transactions, from sales to refunds, are correctly categorized and easy to reconcile with your accounting software.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Pros of A2X for E-commerce Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our clients love A2X, briefly here is why:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Accurate Reconciliation Made Simple</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A2X automates the reconciliation process, saving hours of manual work. It breaks down e-commerce payouts into different categories, such as <strong>sales, refunds, shipping, VAT</strong>, and <strong>marketplace fees</strong>. This granular breakdown allows for easy matching with your bank deposits, eliminating discrepancies and improving the accuracy of your accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. VAT and Sales Tax Compliance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For UK businesses, VAT is often a major concern. A2X makes it easier by identifying and categorizing VAT and sales taxes on transactions. This means when it comes time to file VAT returns, everything is in place, and your numbers are reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Multi-Currency Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re dealing with international sales, currency conversions can be a headache. A2X automatically handles transactions in multiple currencies, ensuring accurate records that reflect real exchange rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Scalability</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a small shop selling handmade goods on Etsy or a large operation with a presence on Amazon and Shopify, A2X scales with you. As your business grows, A2X can manage increasing transaction volumes without adding complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Custom Reporting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A2X offers detailed financial insights. You can customize reports to show exactly what you need—be it <strong>profit and loss</strong>, transaction details, or fee breakdowns. This data can be invaluable for making strategic business decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Cons of A2X</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our clients love A2X, but it isn’t for everyone, briefly here is why:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Pricey for Small Businesses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While A2X provides great value, its pricing can be a bit steep for smaller businesses or startups. Plans start at around <strong>£19/month</strong>, and the cost can increase as your transaction volume grows. For small sellers with tight budgets, this might be a tough pill to swallow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Limited Customization in Entry Plans</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lower-tier plans may not offer all the bells and whistles larger e-commerce businesses might need, such as more advanced custom reporting or deeper integration with multiple sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Setup and Learning Curve</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although A2X automates much of the process, there’s still some initial setup required, and if you’re not familiar with accounting principles, it might take some time to get everything working smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative Software Providers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While A2X is a strong contender in the e-commerce accounting space, there are alternatives worth considering, depending on your business needs and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/budget-2024-the-downsides-you-need-to-watch-out-for/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"99\">budget</a>, which we go into below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Link My Books</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed specifically for e-commerce sellers, <strong>Link My Books</strong> offers similar features to A2X at a potentially lower cost. It supports Amazon, eBay, and Shopify and integrates with Xero and QuickBooks. A big selling point for Link My Books is its focus on <strong>UK VAT compliance</strong>, making it an excellent choice for UK-based businesses. It’s user-friendly and often considered a more budget-friendly alternative to A2X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Taxomate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxomate is another automated accounting tool that focuses on Amazon and Shopify sellers. It offers <strong>Amazon VAT reports</strong>, and its pricing is highly competitive. While it may lack some of the detailed reporting features of A2X, it’s a solid choice for smaller businesses looking to get started with automated accounting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Xero + Shopify Integration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re already a Xero user, you can directly integrate Xero with <strong>Shopify</strong> for automatic syncing of sales and transactions. While not as comprehensive as A2X in terms of transaction breakdowns, this solution is cost-effective, particularly for businesses that only operate on Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. QuickBooks Commerce</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses already using QuickBooks, <strong>QuickBooks Commerce</strong> (formerly TradeGecko) offers a more integrated solution for managing inventory, orders, and accounting under one roof. Though it’s more complex, this all-in-one approach can be a huge asset for scaling e-commerce businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Is A2X Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For UK-based e-commerce clients, <strong>A2X</strong> offers a streamlined, efficient, and reliable way to handle complex online transactions. Its ability to automate reconciliation, support VAT compliance, and manage multi-currency transactions makes it a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. While the price tag may be a bit higher than some alternatives, the time-saving features and accuracy often outweigh the cost for growing businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’re a smaller seller just starting out or looking for a more budget-friendly option, alternatives like <strong>Link My Books</strong> and <strong>Taxomate</strong> may be better fits. As an accountancy practice specialising in e-commerce clients, we offer A2X and similar tools as part of our services to help our clients stay compliant, organised, and focused on growth.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Understanding <strong>domicile and residency</strong> is crucial for anyone living, working, or earning income in the UK. Your tax status can have <strong>a major impact on how much tax you pay</strong>, especially if you have <strong>foreign income, international assets, or spend time abroad</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help individuals and businesses <strong>navigate the complexities of UK tax law</strong>, ensuring you remain <strong>fully compliant while maximising tax efficiencies</strong>. Here’s your <strong>comprehensive guide</strong> to <strong>domicile and residency for income tax</strong> and what it means for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Residency for UK Income Tax?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Residency determines <strong>where you pay tax</strong> on your income. The <strong>UK Statutory Residence Test (SRT)</strong>, introduced in <strong>2013</strong>, is used to assess whether you are a <strong>UK tax resident</strong> for any given tax year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The HMRC Statutory Residence Test (SRT)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SRT is based on a combination of:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Automatic UK Tests</strong> – You are a UK tax resident if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You spend <strong>183 days or more</strong> in the UK in a tax year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You have <strong>a home in the UK</strong> for at least 91 days and spend <strong>30+ days in that home</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You work <strong>full-time (35+ hours per week) in the UK for 365 days</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Automatic Overseas Tests</strong> – You are <strong>not a UK resident</strong> if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You spend <strong>fewer than 16 days</strong> in the UK (if you were a UK resident in any of the last three years).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You spend <strong>fewer than 46 days</strong> in the UK (if you were not a UK resident in the last three years).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You work <strong>full-time abroad</strong>, spending fewer than <strong>91 days in the UK</strong> (and less than <strong>30 days working in the UK</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>The Sufficient Ties Test</strong> – If you do not meet automatic tests, your residency is determined by ties to the UK, such as <strong>family, accommodation, work, or time spent in the UK in previous years</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Domicile and Why Does It Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your <strong>domicile</strong> is different from your <strong>residency</strong> and determines whether you are liable for <strong>UK tax on your worldwide income</strong> or just your UK income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Domicile of Origin</strong> – This is usually the domicile of your father when you were born. ✅ <strong>Domicile of Choice</strong> – You can change your domicile by permanently settling in another country. ✅ <strong>Deemed Domicile</strong> – Introduced in <strong>2017</strong>, individuals who have been <strong>UK residents for at least 15 of the last 20 years</strong> are considered <strong>UK-domiciled for tax purposes</strong>, meaning they must pay tax on <strong>worldwide income</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why it matters?</strong> Domicile status impacts <strong>Inheritance Tax (IHT)</strong> and the ability to claim the <strong>remittance basis of taxation</strong>, which affects how foreign income is taxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If You Are UK Resident and UK Domiciled:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ You are taxed on <strong>worldwide income and gains</strong>. ✅ You must report <strong>foreign investments, rental income, and overseas earnings</strong> to HMRC. ✅ You are liable for <strong>Inheritance Tax (IHT) on worldwide assets</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If You Are UK Resident but Non-Domiciled (Non-Dom):</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ You can <strong>choose the remittance basis</strong>, meaning <strong>foreign income is only taxed if brought into the UK</strong>. ✅ The <strong>remittance basis charge</strong> applies if you’ve been UK resident for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>7 of the last 9 years</strong>: £30,000 annual charge.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>12 of the last 14 years</strong>: £60,000 annual charge. ✅ After <strong>15 years</strong>, you become <strong>deemed domiciled</strong>, meaning you are taxed on <strong>worldwide income</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If You Are Non-Resident:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ You only pay <strong>UK tax on UK-based income</strong> (e.g., UK property rental income). ✅ You do <strong>not</strong> pay UK tax on <strong>foreign earnings or foreign investments</strong>. ✅ You may still be liable for <strong>UK Inheritance Tax</strong> if domiciled in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Have the Rules Changed Over Time?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Pre-2013</strong> – Residency rules were more subjective and open to interpretation. 📌 <strong>2013</strong> – Introduction of the <strong>Statutory Residence Test (SRT)</strong> to standardise UK tax residency. 📌 <strong>2017</strong> – <strong>Non-domicile reforms</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Non-doms living in the UK for <strong>15+ years deemed UK-domiciled</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Non-dom tax benefits <strong>removed for UK residential property held in offshore structures</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offshore trusts changes affecting long-term UK residents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>2024 &amp; Beyond</strong> – HMRC has <strong>increased scrutiny on non-doms</strong> and UK expatriates, making <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"149\">tax planning</a> <strong>more essential than ever</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Important Considerations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Split Year Treatment</strong> – If you move to/from the UK, the tax year may be <strong>split between UK and non-UK residency</strong>. ✅ <strong>Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs)</strong> – If you pay tax abroad, you may avoid double taxation through a <strong>DTA between the UK and another country</strong>. ✅ <strong>Foreign Income Disclosure</strong> – HMRC is cracking down on <strong>undeclared offshore income</strong>, so full transparency is key. ✅ <strong>Inheritance Tax (IHT) on Non-Doms</strong> – If you’re non-domiciled but have UK assets, they may still be <strong>subject to IHT</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Domicile and residency rules are <strong>complex, and mistakes can be costly</strong>.

But Uber is now at the centre of one of the most significant tax disputes in recent history—and the final bill? It could top <strong>£500 million</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s actually going on—and why should <em>you</em> care?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Backstory: Uber’s Original Tax Setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Uber classified its drivers as <strong>self-employed contractors</strong>, which meant:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ No VAT on fares – since most individual drivers earn below the £85,000 VAT threshold<br>✅ Drivers handled their own income tax and National Insurance<br>✅ Uber avoided employer responsibilities like PAYE and NICs</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This setup saved Uber a lot of money—but HMRC wasn’t convinced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC Steps In: “You’re Not Just a Platform”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC argued that Uber wasn’t merely connecting passengers with drivers—it was actually <strong>providing the transport service itself</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that’s the case?<br>💥 <strong>20% VAT applies to every fare</strong><br>💥 <strong>Employer taxes are on the table</strong><br>💥 <strong>Uber could be liable for years of backdated tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fundamentally changes the picture—and it gets even worse for Uber.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Supreme Court Drops the Gavel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, the UK Supreme Court ruled that Uber drivers are not self-employed—they’re <strong>“workers”</strong>. That ruling triggered a domino effect:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🚨 Uber is now responsible for charging VAT on fares<br>🚨 It has to rethink its entire tax structure—from VAT to Corporation Tax<br>🚨 HMRC is pursuing backdated VAT going back several years</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result?

Sounds like a silly question—but when it comes to VAT, <strong>temperature matters</strong>. In fact, it could be the difference between paying <strong>0% VAT</strong> or getting hit with a <strong>20% VAT bill</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, really. A few degrees of heat can mean thousands in extra <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pringles-potato-crisp-or-something-else-the-100-million-tax-debate/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"3\">tax for UK food</a> businesses. Welcome to the wonderfully weird world of the <strong>“Pasty Tax.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hot vs Cold: How Takeaway Food Is Taxed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, the VAT treatment of takeaway food depends on whether the food is served hot or cold:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🥪 <strong>Cold food</strong> (like sandwiches, salads, or sushi): <strong>Zero-rated</strong> for VAT<br>🥧 <strong>Hot food</strong> (like pasties, pies, or hot chicken): <strong>Standard-rated</strong>—that’s <strong>20% VAT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seems straightforward, right? Well, it’s not just about how hot the food is… it’s about <strong>why</strong> it’s hot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Key Question: Is It <em>Meant</em> to Be Hot?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where things get strange. The rules say that VAT applies if the food is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Heated for the <strong>purpose of being eaten hot</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kept hot</strong> before being sold</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketed</strong> as hot food</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sold with utensils or packaging meant for hot consumption</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But if it’s only hot because it’s fresh out of the oven—and <strong>not intended to be eaten hot</strong>—then it might still be <strong>zero-rated</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the same pasty could be taxed differently depending on <strong>intent</strong>. Yes, tax law really is that picky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Famous “Pasty Tax” Battle of 2012</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This bizarre VAT issue came to a head in 2012 when the government tried to clarify the rules and impose 20% VAT on <em>all</em> hot takeaway food—including items that were only warm due to baking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backlash was immediate and intense. Bakeries, supermarkets, and food lovers across the country launched a full-blown campaign against the change, dubbing it the <strong>“Pasty Tax.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After weeks of protests, petitions, and media coverage, the government backed down. The compromise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ If food is hot <strong>because you intend to sell it hot</strong> – <strong>VAT applies</strong><br>✅ If it’s hot <strong>only because it’s freshly baked</strong> – <strong>VAT does <em>not</em> apply</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, a warm pasty that’s not sold as “hot” can be zero-rated. But one kept hot for customers? That’s 20%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters for Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This might sound quirky, but the financial implications are serious—especially for food businesses. Misapplying VAT rules can mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ Overpaying VAT unnecessarily<br>❌ Underpaying and facing penalties later<br>❌ Getting caught in an HMRC review with unexpected consequences</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just food. Many industries face similarly confusing VAT grey areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make sense of odd tax rules so you don’t have to.

      "content": "\n<p>As a UK accountancy practice, we know that individuals and businesses face unique financial challenges. In today’s fast-paced and competitive environment, it’s crucial to get the fundamentals right, especially when it comes to managing your finances. Whether you&#8217;re a freelancer, a startup, or a growing business, understanding accounting is the foundation of your success. Let’s dive into the essentials that every small business owner should know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Cash Flow is King: Master It</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common reasons small businesses fail is poor cash flow management. Profitability doesn&#8217;t always mean you have cash in the bank, and without cash, your business can&#8217;t operate smoothly. Here are a few tips to keep cash flow in check:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Prepare Cash Flow Forecasts</strong>: Know when money is coming in and going out. This allows you to plan for lean months and avoid surprises;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invoice Promptly</strong>: Late invoices are a cash flow killer. Have a system in place to issue invoices immediately after work is completed; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control Costs</strong>: Regularly review expenses to identify where you can cut back without sacrificing quality.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By regularly monitoring your cash flow, you&#8217;ll have a clear understanding of your financial health and avoid unnecessary debt or overdraft charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Separate Business and Personal Finances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For freelancers, sole traders, and small businesses, it&#8217;s tempting to mix personal and business finances—especially when starting out. However, doing so can create confusion and tax issues down the road. Set up a separate <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-choose-the-right-business-bank-account/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"206\">business bank account</a> and keep detailed records for every transaction related to your business. This not only simplifies your accounting but also demonstrates professionalism to clients and (potential) investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Understand the Basics of Bookkeeping</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookkeeping is the backbone of any accounting system. It involves recording all financial transactions—sales, expenses, receipts, and payments—in an organised manner. Whether you hire a bookkeeper or do it yourself using accounting software, good bookkeeping will save you from headaches during tax season:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Track All Expenses</strong>: Make sure every purchase or business-related expense is recorded. Even small costs add up and could be tax-deductible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reconcile Bank Statements</strong>: Regularly match your business bank account with <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-records-should-i-keep-on-my-business-and-for-how-long/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"235\">your accounting records</a> to catch errors or fraudulent transactions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use Accounting Software</strong>: Tools like Xero, QuickBooks, or FreeAgent are essential for small business owners, offering automation, reports, and integration with HMRC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Stay on Top of Taxes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>UK businesses have a range of tax obligations—income tax, VAT, corporation tax, and more. Missing deadlines or miscalculating your tax liabilities can lead to penalties. Here are the key things to keep in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Self-Assessment</strong>: Sole traders and partnerships must file a self-assessment tax return every year, reporting income and allowable expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT</strong>: If your business’s turnover exceeds £85,000, you must register for VAT. Keep detailed VAT records to ensure you’re charging and reclaiming the correct amounts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax</strong>: For limited companies, it’s important to understand your corporation tax responsibilities, which are payable on company profits. Ensure you submit your company tax return on time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consulting an accountant early can help you navigate these requirements efficiently and maximise any tax-saving opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Plan for Growth with Accurate Financial Reports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial reports provide a clear snapshot of your business’s performance and help you make informed decisions. Understanding these key reports will help you manage your business effectively:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Profit &amp; Loss Statement</strong>: Shows whether your business is profitable by comparing revenues and expenses over a specific period.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Balance Sheet</strong>: Gives a summary of your business’s financial position, including assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong>: Shows how changes in the balance sheet and income affect cash and cash equivalents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Regularly reviewing these reports allows you to spot trends, manage cash flow, and plan for the future. They’re also essential when applying for loans, attracting investors, or making major business decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Don’t Overlook Tax Reliefs and Grants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tax reliefs and grants available for small businesses in the UK, designed to stimulate growth, innovation, and sustainability. Here are a few worth investigating:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>R&amp;D Tax Credits</strong>: If your business invests in innovation and research, you may be eligible for research and development (R&amp;D) tax credits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)</strong>: This allows businesses to deduct the full value of qualifying plant and machinery purchases from profits before tax, up to £1 million.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Grants</strong>: The UK government, local councils, and other organisations offer various grants to support small businesses. Keep an eye on what’s available in your region.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Hire the Right Accountant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring a knowledgeable accountant is one of the best investments you can make for your business. A good accountant will ensure your business complies with tax regulations, identify ways to save money, and give you advice to improve financial performance. They can also offer support on more complex matters like payroll, VAT registration, and corporation tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for accountants who specialise in working with small businesses, as they’ll be more familiar with the unique challenges you face. And don&#8217;t forget, it&#8217;s not just about compliance—accountants are your strategic partners in business growth along every step of your business’ journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Make the Most of Technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In today’s digital age, leveraging technology can streamline your accounting processes. Many businesses are moving towards cloud accounting software that can manage everything from invoicing to tax filing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advantages of using cloud accounting include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: You can access your financial data from anywhere.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Automate tasks like invoicing, payment reminders, and bank reconciliations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integration</strong>: Easily integrate with other software you use for inventory, e-commerce, or CRM.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Many cloud accounting platforms are Making Tax Digital (MTD) compliant, meaning they’re designed to submit your VAT and other tax returns directly to HMRC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Embracing cloud accounting can free up time and help you focus on growing your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By mastering the basics of accounting, you empower yourself to make smarter decisions that fuel your business growth. Whether it’s managing cash flow, staying on top of taxes, or leveraging the latest accounting software, small business success starts with sound financial management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/welcome-adam-our-first-accounting-apprentice-joins-the-team/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"89\">team of experienced accountants</a> is here to help you navigate the complexities of accounting, so you can focus on what you do best—running your business.

      "content": "\n<p>If you’re a <strong>contractor, freelancer, or work through a limited company</strong>, then <strong>IR35</strong> is a term you need to understand. These rules have had a <strong>massive impact</strong> on how independent workers are taxed, and getting it wrong can mean <strong>hefty fines and unexpected tax bills</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help <strong>contractors and businesses navigate IR35</strong> to ensure they stay compliant and avoid costly mistakes. Here’s everything you need to know about IR35 and how it affects you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Brief History of IR35</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IR35, also known as the <strong>off-payroll working rules</strong>, was introduced in <strong>April 2000</strong> by HMRC to <strong>tackle tax avoidance</strong>. The aim was to stop workers from setting up <strong>personal service companies (PSCs)</strong> to <strong>avoid PAYE tax and National Insurance</strong> when they were essentially working as employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, IR35 has undergone <strong>several changes</strong>, with major reforms in <strong>2017 (public sector)</strong> and <strong>2021 (private sector)</strong> that shifted the responsibility for determining IR35 status from contractors to their clients in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are the IR35 Rules?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IR35 determines whether a contractor is <strong>genuinely self-employed</strong> or should be taxed like an <strong>employee</strong>. The key tests to determine status include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Control</strong> – Does the client <strong>control</strong> how, when, and where you work? If yes, <strong>you may be inside IR35</strong>. 📌 <strong>Substitution</strong> – Can you send someone else to do your work, or does the client require you specifically? If you <strong>can’t substitute</strong>, you may be <strong>inside IR35</strong>. 📌 <strong>Mutuality of Obligation (MOO)</strong> – Does the client have to offer you work, and are you obliged to accept it? If yes, <strong>you might be inside IR35</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a contractor is <strong>inside IR35</strong>, they must pay <strong>Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) like an employee</strong>, but without the benefits (holiday pay, sick pay, pensions). If <strong>outside IR35</strong>, they are considered genuinely self-employed and can pay themselves more tax-efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Does IR35 Apply To?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Freelancers and Contractors</strong> – Especially those working through a <strong>Personal Service Company (PSC)</strong>. ✅ <strong>Businesses Hiring Contractors</strong> – Companies hiring independent workers must assess their IR35 status. ✅ <strong>Public and Private Sector Clients</strong> – <strong>Public sector clients (since 2017)</strong> and <strong>medium/large private sector clients (since 2021)</strong> must determine IR35 status. ✅ <strong>Agencies Placing Contractors</strong> – Recruitment agencies can also be responsible for ensuring IR35 compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sole traders</strong> are not affected by IR35 but must still follow HMRC’s rules on self-employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Has IR35 Evolved?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🔹 Pre-2017: Contractors Determined Their Own Status</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before 2017, contractors working through <strong>limited companies</strong> had to decide if they were <strong>inside or outside IR35</strong>. Many <strong>misclassified themselves</strong> as outside IR35 to reduce their tax bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🔹 2017: Public Sector Reform</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>April 2017</strong>, the responsibility for determining IR35 status shifted to <strong>public sector clients</strong> (e.g., NHS, government departments). Many contractors were deemed <strong>inside IR35</strong>, leading to higher taxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🔹 2021: Private Sector Reform</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>April 2021</strong>, the same rules applied to <strong>medium and large private sector businesses</strong>, meaning clients, not contractors, had to assess IR35 status. Small businesses (meeting two of these three criteria) are exempt: ✔️ Turnover under £10.2m ✔️ Balance sheet under £5.1m ✔️ Fewer than 50 employees</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a company qualifies as <strong>small</strong>, contractors working for them <strong>still determine their own IR35 status</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is CEST? (Check Employment Status for Tax)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CEST is HMRC’s <strong>official online tool</strong> to determine IR35 status. It asks questions about: ✅ Working practices ✅ Control and substitution ✅ Financial risk and obligations</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>CEST has been criticised</strong> for <strong>inconsistent results</strong> and failing to consider key legal precedents. Many businesses and contractors seek <strong>expert advice</strong> instead of relying solely on CEST.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens If You’re Inside IR35?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>🔹 You’ll pay <strong>Income Tax and NICs at source</strong> via PAYE. 🔹 You won’t be able to <strong>split income between salary and dividends</strong>. 🔹 You may receive <strong>lower take-home pay</strong> than if you were outside IR35. 🔹 Your client or agency will be responsible for <strong>deducting tax before paying you</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If found to be <strong>wrongly operating outside IR35</strong>, HMRC can <strong>demand backdated tax payments, penalties, and interest</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Helps Contractors &amp; Freelancers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IR35 is <strong>complex</strong>, but we make compliance <strong>simple</strong>.

However, this approach was nearly brought to an end following one of the most significant tax cases in recent UK history: the <strong>Arctic Systems</strong> case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Background: A Straightforward Setup—Or So It Seemed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Geoff Jones operated a company called <strong>Arctic Systems Ltd</strong>. His wife, Diana, held shares in the business and received dividends accordingly. Because Diana was a basic-rate taxpayer, the couple reduced their overall tax liability by shifting a portion of the company’s profits to her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a legal and business perspective, this arrangement appeared entirely legitimate. But HMRC took a very different view.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC’s Challenge: Income Shifting Allegations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC contended that Geoff was the individual generating the company’s income and that the dividends paid to Diana were a form of <strong>income shifting</strong>—that is, transferring income to a lower-taxed spouse purely to reduce tax. They argued that the income should be taxed as if it were entirely Geoff’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was more than just a dispute about one couple’s tax affairs; the case had implications for thousands of family-owned businesses across the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Court’s Ruling: A Landmark Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The case eventually reached the <strong>House of Lords</strong>, which ruled in favour of the Joneses. The court concluded:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Both spouses legally owned their shares.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividends were paid <strong>because they were shareholders</strong>, not as disguised remuneration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The arrangement constituted <strong>legitimate <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"147\">tax planning</a></strong>, not tax avoidance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a landmark victory for family business owners across the country, affirming that income from jointly owned businesses could be shared legitimately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC’s Response: A Change in Tactics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the court’s ruling, HMRC did not stop there. In the years following the case, the tax authority introduced several measures to restrict the perceived abuse of dividend arrangements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>dividend tax allowance has been significantly reduced</strong>, falling to just <strong>£500</strong> from April 2024.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HMRC now pays <strong>closer attention to the role of non-working spouses</strong>. If a spouse is not actively involved in the business, HMRC may challenge the legitimacy of dividend payments made to them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many businesses are now exploring alternative structures such as <strong>Family Investment Companies (FICs)</strong> to achieve similar tax efficiencies under the new rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Current Position: Is Dividend Splitting Still Viable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>, but it is no longer as straightforward as it once was. While it is still possible to split dividends between spouses, doing so requires careful consideration of both share ownership and the roles played within the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorrectly structured arrangements may lead to HMRC challenging the setup, resulting in reclassification of income and unexpected tax liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How We Can Help at Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we work closely with family-run businesses to ensure their tax planning is both effective and compliant.

One of the most underutilised yet powerful tools for married couples and civil partners is the <strong>Marriage Allowance</strong>—a simple way to legally reduce your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’re passionate about helping our clients take advantage of every tax-saving opportunity. Here’s everything you need to know about <strong>Marriage Allowance</strong>, how it works, and why you should check if you’re eligible <strong>right now!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Brief History of Marriage Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Marriage Allowance</strong> was introduced by the UK government in <strong>April 2015</strong> as a way to support low-income couples by allowing a portion of the lower-earning partner’s tax-free personal allowance to be transferred to their higher-earning spouse. The goal? To reduce the amount of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-benefits-married-with-children/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"53\">tax paid by married couples</a> and civil partners where one partner earns significantly less than the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many eligible couples have claimed it, <strong>millions of UK couples still miss out on this simple tax break every year</strong>—don’t be one of them!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Marriage Allowance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Marriage Allowance allows one spouse or civil partner to <strong>transfer up to 10% of their Personal Allowance</strong> to the other, reducing the total tax paid by the higher earner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the <strong>2024/25 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/have-you-ever-wondered/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"21\">tax year</a></strong>, the standard <strong>Personal Allowance</strong> (the amount you can earn before paying income tax) is <strong>£12,570</strong>. That means a lower-earning <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/employing-your-spouse-tax/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"48\">spouse</a> can transfer up to £1,260 of their unused allowance to their partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This results in a <strong>tax saving of up to £252 per year</strong>—and even better, <strong>you can backdate claims for up to four years</strong>, potentially saving over <strong>£1,000</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Can Claim Marriage Allowance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To be eligible for <strong>Marriage Allowance</strong>, you must meet the following criteria: ✅ You’re <strong>married or in a civil partnership</strong> (cohabiting partners do not qualify). ✅ One partner earns <strong>less than £12,570 per year</strong> (below the Personal Allowance threshold). ✅ The higher-earning partner earns <strong>between £12,571 and £50,270</strong> (basic rate taxpayer in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland) or up to <strong>£43,662</strong> in Scotland. ✅ Both partners must be <strong>born after 6 April 1935</strong> (those born before this may qualify for <strong>Married Couple’s Allowance</strong>, a different tax relief).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does Marriage Allowance Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Example 1 – A Couple Maximising Marriage Allowance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sarah earns £10,000 per year</strong> (below the Personal Allowance threshold).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>David earns £30,000 per year</strong> (basic rate taxpayer).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sarah transfers <strong>£1,260</strong> of her unused allowance to David.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>David’s <strong>taxable income is reduced</strong>, resulting in a <strong>£252 tax saving</strong> for the year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Example 2 – Backdating Claims</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If Sarah and David haven’t claimed Marriage Allowance for the last four years, they can <strong>claim for past tax years</strong>, potentially saving over <strong>£1,000 in total</strong>!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Apply for Marriage Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying is <strong>quick, easy, and free</strong> via <strong>HMRC’s website</strong>. Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1️⃣ <strong>Check Your Eligibility</strong> – Ensure one partner earns below <strong>£12,570</strong>, and the other is a <strong>basic rate taxpayer</strong>. 2️⃣ <strong>Apply Online</strong> – The lower-earning partner must make the application through the <strong>HMRC website</strong>. 3️⃣ <strong>HMRC Adjusts Your <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/what-is-my-tax-code/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"128\">Tax Code</a></strong> – The higher earner’s tax code will change (usually to <strong>‘M’</strong> for them and <strong>‘N’</strong> for the lower earner). 4️⃣ <strong>Enjoy the Tax Savings!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once approved, the allowance <strong>automatically renews each tax year</strong>, so you don’t need to reapply unless your circumstances change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Interesting Facts About Marriage Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>🔹 <strong>You Can Claim After a Partner Has Passed Away</strong> – If your spouse or civil partner passed away within the last four years, you may still be able to backdate and claim Marriage Allowance. 🔹 <strong>It Won’t Affect Your Tax Refunds</strong> – If you’re due a tax refund, Marriage Allowance won’t stop you from receiving it. 🔹 <strong>It’s Not the Same as Married Couple’s Allowance</strong> – If <strong>one partner was born before 6 April 1935</strong>, they may qualify for a <strong>more generous tax break</strong> instead. 🔹 <strong>Even If You’re Self-Employed, You Can Claim!</strong> – Marriage Allowance applies to both <strong>PAYE and self-employed individuals</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help our clients <strong>reduce tax bills and maximise savings</strong>.

One striking example is how books were historically taxed in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might reasonably assume that whether you purchase a book in print or in digital format, the tax treatment should be the same. For many years, however, that was not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT on Books: A Longstanding Disparity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, UK VAT legislation treated printed books and their digital equivalents very differently:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Printed Books</strong> – Zero-rated for VAT (no VAT charged).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ebooks and Digital Publications</strong> – Previously subject to <strong>20% VAT</strong>, despite containing the same content.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This discrepancy caused considerable debate across the publishing industry, particularly as digital learning and online reading grew in popularity. Publishers, booksellers, authors, educators, and consumers all called for fairness—but HMRC maintained its position for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Justification: Essential Knowledge vs Digital Goods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC’s reasoning was that printed books were considered providers of “essential knowledge,” and thus deserved zero-rating. Digital books, on the other hand, were classed as “electronic goods” and taxed accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Consumers paid more for ebooks than for physical books—despite the content being identical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Turning Point: The 2020 VAT Reform</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/2020-review/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"37\">2020</a>, the situation changed. Amid the COVID-19 <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/preparing-for-a-post-pandemic-world/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"34\">pandemic</a>, demand for digital reading materials and online education tools soared. In response, the UK government fast-tracked a planned VAT change initially scheduled for December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>1 May 2020</strong>, ebooks and other qualifying digital publications became <strong>zero-rated for VAT</strong>, aligning them with their printed counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Impact of the Change</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a significant development for the publishing industry and the wider digital economy:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consumers</strong> immediately benefitted from a 20% price reduction on ebooks, online newspapers, and other digital publications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Publishers and authors</strong> saw an increase in digital sales, as the VAT advantage for print was removed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Schools, libraries, and students</strong> gained better access to educational materials at a reduced cost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was widely seen as a long-overdue correction, and a rare example of HMRC responding quickly to technological change and economic necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters for Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This case highlights a broader issue: <strong>tax law often struggles to keep pace with technology</strong>. What may seem like a minor VAT distinction can have significant implications for pricing, profitability, and competitiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses operating in digital publishing, education, e-commerce, or any VAT-sensitive sector, understanding the subtleties of VAT treatment is crucial. Getting it wrong—by misclassifying products or failing to adjust for legislative changes—can lead to lost revenue or potential penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we do more than prepare accounts—we partner with businesses to navigate complex and evolving tax rules.

      "content": "\n<p>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is a tax that many people don’t think about—until they’re suddenly facing a large bill! Whether you’re selling a property, shares, or a valuable asset, <strong>understanding CGT can help you plan ahead, minimise your liability, and avoid costly mistakes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make tax simple. We handle the complexities of <strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong> so you can focus on what you do best—<strong>running your business and growing your wealth</strong>. Here’s everything you need to know about CGT and how to reduce your tax bill legally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Capital Gains Tax (CGT)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the <strong>profit</strong> (gain) you make when you sell or dispose of an asset that has increased in value. It’s <strong>not the total sale price that’s taxed, just the gain</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Assets Subject to CGT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Property (excluding your main home in most cases) ✅ Shares and investments (outside of ISAs or pensions) ✅ Business assets ✅ Valuables such as art, antiques, and collectibles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <strong>gift an asset</strong> (other than to your spouse or a charity), you may also need to pay CGT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capital Gains Tax Rates for 2024/25</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CGT rate depends on <strong>what you’re selling and your income tax band</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>For Residential Property (not your main home)</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>18%</strong> (Basic rate taxpayers)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>24%</strong> (Higher/Additional rate taxpayers)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>For Other Assets (Shares, Business Assets, etc.)</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>10%</strong> (Basic rate taxpayers)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>20%</strong> (Higher/Additional rate taxpayers)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🔹 <strong>Tax-Free Allowance</strong>: You can make <strong>£3,000 tax-free</strong> in capital gains before CGT applies (2024/25). This has been reduced from previous years, making <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"146\">tax planning</a> even more important!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Calculate Capital Gains Tax</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work Out Your Gain</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sale Price – Original Purchase Price – Allowable Costs = <strong>Capital Gain</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You bought a second property for <strong>£200,000</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You sell it for <strong>£300,000</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your gain is <strong>£100,000</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re a higher-rate taxpayer, you’d pay <strong>24% on £97,000</strong> (after the £3,000 allowance) = <strong>£23,280 in CGT</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ways to Reduce Your Capital Gains Tax Bill</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Use Your CGT Allowance</strong> – Sell assets strategically over different tax years to <strong>maximise tax-free gains</strong>. ✅ <strong>Transfer Assets to a Spouse</strong> – Married couples and civil partners can transfer assets <strong>tax-free</strong>, allowing them to <strong>double their CGT allowance</strong>. ✅ <strong>Offset Capital Losses</strong> – If you make a loss on an asset, you can <strong>offset it against your gains</strong>, reducing your tax bill. ✅ <strong>Claim Private Residence Relief</strong> – If selling your main home, you may qualify for <strong>full CGT relief</strong>. ✅ <strong>Use Tax-Efficient Investments</strong> – <strong>ISAs, pensions, and certain business reliefs</strong> can help shield investments from CGT. ✅ <strong>Consider Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR)</strong> – If you’re selling a business, you may <strong>pay just 10% tax on gains up to £1 million</strong>. ✅ <strong>Utilise Roll-Over Relief</strong> – If you reinvest proceeds from the sale of a business asset into a new qualifying asset, you can <strong>defer CGT until you sell the new asset</strong>. ✅ <strong>Use Hold-Over Relief</strong> – If gifting business assets or shares in a trading company, you may <strong>defer CGT until the recipient disposes of the asset</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When and How to Report CGT to HMRC</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>📅 <strong>If you sell a residential property, you must report and pay CGT within 60 days</strong>. 📅 <strong>For other assets, CGT is reported in your Self-Assessment Tax Return by 31 January following the tax year</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to report on time can result in <strong>penalties and interest</strong>, so it’s crucial to stay ahead!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital Gains Tax doesn’t have to be a headache—we’re here to help <strong>you keep more of your money</strong> while staying fully compliant with HMRC. Here’s what we do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✔️ <strong>Tax Planning Advice</strong> – We help you structure asset sales <strong>to minimise CGT liability</strong>. ✔️ <strong>Calculations &amp; Reporting</strong> – We handle the calculations, ensuring <strong>you never overpay</strong>. ✔️ <strong>Reliefs &amp; Allowances</strong> – We identify every possible exemption or relief you’re entitled to, including <strong>Roll-Over and Hold-Over Relief</strong>. ✔️ <strong>HMRC Compliance</strong> – We ensure timely and accurate reporting, so you avoid penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plan Ahead &amp; Save on Capital Gains Tax!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart tax planning can <strong>save you thousands in unnecessary CGT payments</strong>.

And one fascinating example of how these rules can affect businesses (and consumers) is the VAT treatment of <strong>helicopter flying lessons</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is simple: <strong>are flying lessons a form of professional training or a leisure activity?</strong> The answer, according to HMRC, can have a significant impact on your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT on Flying Lessons: A Clear Divide</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, the VAT treatment of flying lessons depends on the <strong>purpose of the training</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commercial Pilot Training (CPL)</strong> – <em>VAT-exempt</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Private Pilot Training (PPL) or Recreational Flying</strong> – <em>Subject to 20% VAT</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student is training with the clear intention of qualifying as a <strong>commercial pilot</strong>, then the lessons are regarded as <strong>vocational training</strong> and are <strong>exempt from VAT</strong>. However, if the lessons are undertaken for personal enjoyment or to obtain a <strong>Private Pilot Licence (PPL)</strong>—even if they involve the same technical instruction—they are considered a <strong>leisure activity</strong> and attract the standard 20% VAT rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the Distinction Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many flight schools have argued that even PPL training provides valuable skills and often leads to professional careers in aviation. However, HMRC’s position is strict: unless the training is <strong>directly linked to a future taxable profession</strong>, it is classed as a non-essential, recreational activity—and therefore <strong>taxable</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has several implications:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>PPL students face higher costs</strong>, due to the additional VAT charge.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flight schools must carefully assess and document the nature of training provided</strong>, to apply the correct VAT treatment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Incorrect classification could lead to backdated tax assessments</strong>, potentially costing <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/vat-on-uk-private-school-fees-what-it-means-and-how-to-prepare/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"119\">schools</a> thousands in unpaid VAT.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bigger Picture: VAT and Training Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue extends far beyond aviation. Across many industries, businesses offering <strong>education, training, coaching, or experiences</strong> face similar challenges. Whether the service is VAT-exempt or standard-rated often depends on <strong>HMRC’s interpretation of intent and outcome</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Language courses may be exempt if linked to professional development, but taxable if taken for leisure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fitness instruction could be exempt when medically prescribed, but taxed when delivered as a general wellbeing service.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, <strong>how your services are classified can significantly affect your pricing, competitiveness, and tax liability</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we support businesses of all sizes in understanding and applying VAT rules effectively. If you offer any kind of training, experience-based service, or educational programme, we can help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ensure correct VAT classification</strong>—reducing the risk of HMRC disputes or penalties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimise pricing structures</strong>—factoring in VAT implications to protect your margins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stay compliant with changing regulations</strong>—helping you adapt to evolving tax law.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Running a training business? Don’t let VAT confusion clip your wings.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in touch with <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> today and ensure your VAT strategy is clear, compliant, and cost-effective.</p>\n",

The main VAT rates are: ✅ <strong>Standard rate (20%)</strong> – Most goods &amp; services. ✅ <strong>Reduced rate (5%)</strong> – Items like home energy and children’s car seats. ✅ <strong>Zero rate (0%)</strong> – Books, newspapers, children’s clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Filing Deadline:</strong> VAT returns are usually <strong>filed quarterly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PAYE &amp; National Insurance Contributions (NICs)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have <strong>employees</strong>, you must run <strong>Pay As You Earn (PAYE)</strong> payroll and <strong>deduct tax &amp; NICs</strong> from their wages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Key NIC Rates for Employers (2024/25):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>13.8%</strong> on earnings over £9,100 per year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Employees also pay <strong>NICs</strong> at different rates depending on their salary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dividend Tax (For Company Directors &amp; Shareholders)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take money out of your limited company as <strong>dividends</strong>, you pay dividend tax based on these rates: ✅ <strong>£500 tax-free allowance</strong> ✅ <strong>8.75% (Basic Rate)</strong> – Earnings up to £50,270 ✅ <strong>33.75% (Higher Rate)</strong> – Earnings up to £125,140 ✅ <strong>39.35% (Additional Rate)</strong> – Earnings above £125,140</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Paying yourself a <strong>mix of salary &amp; dividends</strong> can be <strong>tax-efficient</strong>—we can help you <strong>optimise your pay structure</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business operates in the <strong>construction industry</strong>, you may need to register for the <strong>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong>. Under CIS: ✅ <strong>Contractors must deduct tax</strong> at source from subcontractors and pass it to HMRC. ✅ <strong>Subcontractors can register</strong> for CIS to have deductions at a lower rate of <strong>20%</strong> instead of <strong>30%</strong>. ✅ <strong>Monthly CIS returns</strong> must be submitted by contractors to report payments and deductions. ✅ Failure to comply can result in <strong>penalties</strong> and loss of <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/gross-payment-status-and-cis-what-you-need-to-know/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"69\">gross payment status</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Filing Deadline:</strong> CIS returns must be <strong>submitted by the 19th of each month</strong> following payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits-in-Kind (BIK)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some employers offer <strong>non-cash perks</strong> (benefits-in-kind) that employees must pay tax on. Common BIKs include: ✅ <strong>Company cars &amp; fuel allowances</strong> ✅ <strong>Private healthcare</strong> ✅ <strong>Interest-free loans over £10,000</strong> ✅ <strong>Gym memberships</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers must <strong>report these benefits</strong> on a <strong>P11D form</strong> or through <strong>payrolling benefits</strong>, and Class 1A National Insurance Contributions apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>Filing Deadline:</strong> P11D forms must be submitted to HMRC by <strong>6 July each year</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Key Tax Deadlines to Remember</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines means <strong>penalties from HMRC</strong>—mark these in your calendar! 📅 <strong>31 January</strong> – Self-Assessment tax return deadline. 📅 <strong>31 March/5 April</strong> – <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/pre-year-end-tax-planning-opportunities-2022/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"145\">End of the UK tax</a> year. 📅 <strong>6 July</strong> – P11D deadline for reporting benefits-in-kind. 📅 <strong>22nd of Each Month</strong> – PAYE &amp; NICs payment deadline (if paying electronically). 📅 <strong>Quarterly VAT Filing</strong> – Varies depending on your VAT registration date. 📅 <strong>9 Months After Year-End</strong> – Corporation Tax payment deadline. 📅 <strong>19th of Each Month</strong> – CIS return deadline for contractors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. How to Legally Reduce Your Tax Bill</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody wants to <strong>pay more tax than necessary</strong>, and the good news is <strong>there are ways to reduce your tax bill legally</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Claim All Allowable Expenses</strong> – Office costs, travel, marketing, staff wages, professional fees—these can all reduce your taxable income. ✅ <strong>Use Tax-Efficient Pension Contributions</strong> – Payments into a pension <strong>reduce your Corporation Tax or Self-Employed profits</strong>. ✅ <strong>Take Advantage of R&amp;D Tax Credits</strong> – If your company is innovating, you could <strong>claim a tax rebate</strong> on research &amp; development. ✅ <strong>Maximise VAT Schemes</strong> – Consider the <strong>Flat Rate Scheme</strong> if you’re VAT-registered, or cash accounting to help with cash flow. ✅ <strong>Plan Your Pay Structure Efficiently</strong> – A mix of <strong>salary, dividends, and pension contributions</strong> can <strong>minimise tax</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

However, this seemingly straightforward issue led to a major courtroom battle—and a <strong>£100 million VAT bill</strong>—all due to the complexities of UK tax law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This unusual case provides a valuable reminder of just how <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/christmas-crackers-toy-or-party-product-the-vat-classification-that-sparked-a-festive-debate/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2\">nuanced VAT classification</a> can be</strong>, and how critical it is for businesses to understand how their products are treated under the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT and Snacks: More Complicated Than You Might Think</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under UK VAT legislation, <strong>potato crisps and similar products</strong> are subject to the standard 20% VAT rate. However, many other types of food—including a wide range of snacks—are <strong>zero-rated</strong>, meaning no VAT is charged at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This distinction creates a clear incentive for manufacturers to argue that their products fall outside the “crisps” category. And that’s exactly what <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong>, the company behind <strong>Pringles</strong>, attempted to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Argument: Not Quite a Crisp?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Procter &amp; Gamble’s case was built on the technical composition and production method of Pringles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pringles are made from a dough containing only <strong>42% potato</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unlike traditional crisps, they are <strong>pressed and moulded into shape</strong>, not sliced from whole potatoes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They are <strong>uniform in shape and texture</strong>, rather than the irregular appearance of most bagged crisps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this, the company argued that Pringles should be considered a <strong>“savoury snack”</strong>, not a <strong>“potato crisp”</strong>—and therefore should be <strong>zero-rated for VAT</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC’s Response: A Crisp by Any Other Name</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the technicalities, HMRC disagreed. The case eventually made its way through the courts, with the <strong>Court of Appeal</strong> ultimately ruling that <strong>Pringles are, in fact, potato crisps</strong> for VAT purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Procter &amp; Gamble was <strong>liable for £100 million in backdated VAT</strong>. The decision came down to the court’s interpretation of how the average consumer would view the product, and the fact that potato content remained a substantial component.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Case Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This high-profile case highlights a broader truth for businesses: <strong>VAT classification is not always intuitive</strong>, and <strong>minor details can carry enormous financial consequences</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you sell <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-talk-jaffa-cakes-cake-or-biscuit-tax-debate/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"10\">food</a>, provide services, or manufacture products, the way your offerings are classified for VAT purposes can significantly affect:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pricing and profitability</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax liability</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compliance risks</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And as the Pringles case shows, <strong>misunderstanding or misapplying the rules can result in major costs</strong>—even for large, sophisticated companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we work with businesses across sectors to ensure they are both <strong>tax-efficient</strong> and <strong>compliant</strong>.

      "content": "\n<p>Running a business is exciting, but let’s be honest—financial statements can feel like a <strong>foreign language</strong>. If terms like <strong>balance sheet, profit &amp; loss, and cash flow statement</strong> make your head spin, don’t worry—you’re not alone!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we believe <strong>numbers should work for you, not against you</strong>. That’s why we break it all down in a way that’s easy to understand, so you can focus on what you do best—<strong>growing your business</strong>. Here’s your beginner-friendly guide to <strong>understanding financial statements</strong> and why they matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Financial Statements and Why Do They Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial statements <strong>tell the story of your business</strong>. They help you <strong>track performance, make informed decisions, and stay compliant</strong> with HMRC. Whether you’re applying for a loan, attracting investors, or planning your next big move, these reports are essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three key financial statements every business owner should understand are: 📌 <strong>Profit &amp; Loss Statement (P&amp;L)</strong> – Shows how much money you’re making (or losing). 📌 <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> – A snapshot of your business’s financial health. 📌 <strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> – Tracks how money moves in and out of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break them down!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Profit &amp; Loss Statement (P&amp;L) – Are You Profitable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your <strong>Profit &amp; Loss Statement</strong> (also called the <strong>Income Statement</strong>) tells you whether your business is <strong>making a profit or running at a loss</strong> over a set period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Sections:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Revenue (Sales):</strong> Total income from goods or services. ✅ <strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> Costs directly related to production (e.g., materials, labour). ✅ <strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Revenue minus COGS—this shows how much you’re making before expenses. ✅ <strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> Business running costs (rent, salaries, marketing, utilities). ✅ <strong>Net Profit (or Loss):</strong> The bottom line—<strong>what’s left after all expenses and taxes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>👉 <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Helps you see if your business is profitable and where you can cut costs or increase revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Balance Sheet – How Healthy Is Your Business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> gives you a snapshot of your business’s <strong>financial position at a specific moment in time</strong>. It’s divided into three key sections:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Sections:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Assets:</strong> What your business owns (cash, equipment, inventory, property). ✅ <strong>Liabilities:</strong> What your business owes (loans, credit, unpaid invoices). ✅ <strong>Equity:</strong> What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets—this is your net worth!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>👉 <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Banks and investors look at your <strong>balance sheet</strong> to assess financial health. It helps you understand if you can pay your debts, invest in growth, or need to adjust spending.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Cash Flow Statement – Is Your Business Surviving or Thriving?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A business can be <strong>profitable on paper but still run out of cash</strong>—this is why the <strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> is crucial. It tracks <strong>where your money is coming from and where it’s going</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Sections:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> Money earned or spent in day-to-day operations. ✅ <strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> Money spent on equipment, property, or investments. ✅ <strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> Loans, repayments, or capital contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>👉 <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> <strong>Cash is king</strong>—a positive cash flow means your business can <strong>pay bills, invest, and grow</strong>. A negative cash flow could mean financial trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Black &amp; White Accounting Makes It Easy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know <strong>financial statements can be overwhelming</strong>, which is why we <strong>handle the hard stuff for you</strong>. Here’s how we help:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>We Translate Numbers Into Plain English</strong> – No jargon, just clear explanations. ✅ <strong>We Handle Compliance &amp; Reporting</strong> – So you stay compliant with HMRC and Companies House. ✅ <strong>We Help You Make Smarter Decisions</strong> – By identifying trends, highlighting opportunities, and flagging risks. ✅ <strong>We Free Up Your Time</strong> – You focus on running your business, we take care of the numbers. ✅ <strong>We Offer Real-Time Insights</strong> – With cloud accounting software like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, and FreeAgent</strong>, you’ll always know where you stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts: Understanding = Business Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial statements <strong>aren’t just numbers on a page—they’re the key to your business success</strong>. Knowing how to <strong>read and use them</strong> helps you <strong>stay in control, make better decisions, and plan for the future</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make it easy for you.

Look for professionals who are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Chartered or Certified</strong> – Ensure they are accredited by a recognised body such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AAT (Association of Accounting Technicians)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Registered with HMRC</strong> – If they’re handling tax affairs, they should be a registered tax agent with HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Experienced in Your Industry</strong> – Different sectors have unique tax considerations, so look for an accountant with experience in your field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Proficient in Modern Accounting Software</strong> – Your accountant should be comfortable using tools like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent, and Sage</strong> to keep your accounts digital and compliant with <strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Continuously Learning &amp; Up-to-Date with Tax Laws</strong> – Tax regulations change frequently, so your accountant should stay informed on <strong>HMRC updates, VAT changes, and new tax reliefs</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Services Your Accountant Should Provide</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/find-great-accountant/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"226\">best accountants</a> don’t just crunch numbers—they <strong>add value</strong> to your business.

But behind this seasonal tradition lies a much more serious issue for manufacturers and retailers: <strong>VAT classification</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question at the heart of a now well-known VAT debate was this: <strong>Are <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/its-chrisssssstmasss/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"49\">Christmas</a> crackers considered children’s toys, or are they party products?</strong> The answer has had significant tax implications for businesses and consumers alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding the VAT Distinction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under UK VAT legislation, different items are treated in very different ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Children’s toys</strong> are generally <strong>zero-rated</strong> for VAT. This means that no VAT is charged on their sale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Party products</strong>, including seasonal items like Christmas crackers, are typically subject to <strong>standard rate VAT at 20%</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This created a dilemma: if a Christmas cracker contains a toy, should it be zero-rated like a toy, or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/know-staff-christmas-party-tax-deductible/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"220\">taxed like a party</a> product?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC’s Position: It’s About the Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC ultimately ruled that <strong>Christmas crackers are classified as party products</strong>, <strong>even when they contain toys</strong>. The justification was based on several key considerations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The product is about more than just the contents—it’s about the <strong>festive experience</strong>: pulling the cracker, hearing the snap, reading the joke, and wearing the hat.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crackers are sold as <strong>seasonal novelty items</strong>, not as children’s toys in their own right.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The marketing and purpose of the product are focused on celebration rather than play.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, crackers remain subject to <strong>20% VAT</strong>, increasing costs across the supply chain—from manufacturers to end consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bigger Picture: Small Details, Big Consequences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is yet another example of how <strong>minor differences in product classification can lead to major tax implications</strong>. Businesses working with seasonal goods, bundled products, or items that cross multiple categories often find themselves grappling with unclear or complex VAT rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When these rules are misunderstood or misapplied, the consequences can include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Higher-than-necessary tax liabilities</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced profit margins</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unexpected backdated VAT assessments from HMRC</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What This Means for Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a simple cracker can spark this kind of VAT dispute, imagine what could be lurking in your product catalogue. From bundled items and promotional goods to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/tax-talk-ebooks-vs-printed-books-a-taxing-difference/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"4\">digital products</a> and services, <strong>VAT classification must be reviewed carefully and regularly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping businesses manage the complexities of VAT, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Accurate classification of goods and services</strong>, even in tricky or seasonal cases</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identifying tax-saving opportunities</strong> through correct VAT treatment</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ensuring compliance</strong> with current regulations to avoid unnecessary penalties</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you operate in retail, manufacturing, e-commerce, or any VAT-sensitive industry, we’re here to help you <strong>make informed decisions</strong> and remain <strong>both compliant and tax-efficient</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Selling seasonal products or VAT-sensitive goods?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> help ensure your VAT position is clear, correct, and cost-effective.

Here’s everything you need to know about <strong><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/help-me-reduce-my-self-assessment-tax/\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"101\">Self-Assessment Tax</a> Returns in the UK</strong> and why working with an accountant can save you <strong>time, money, and stress</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Self-Assessment Tax Return?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Self-Assessment Tax Return (SA100)</strong> is how individuals report their <strong>income, expenses, and tax liabilities</strong> to HMRC. Unlike employees who have tax deducted through PAYE, self-employed individuals and others with untaxed income must <strong>calculate and pay their own tax</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Needs to File a Self-Assessment Tax Return?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You must file a Self-Assessment tax return if you: ✅ <strong>Are self-employed</strong> and earned over <strong>£1,000</strong> in a tax year. ✅ <strong>Are a landlord</strong> earning rental income over <strong>£2,500 after expenses</strong>. ✅ <strong>Are a company director</strong> and receive untaxed income. ✅ <strong>Earn over £100,000</strong> from any source (employment, self-employment, rental income, etc.). ✅ <strong>Earn over £50,000</strong> and claim <strong>Child Benefit</strong> (due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge). ✅ <strong>Receive foreign income</strong> or have complex tax affairs. ✅ <strong>Have significant investment income</strong> beyond tax-free allowances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not sure whether you need to file, it’s always best to <strong>double-check with an expert</strong>—missing a required return can result in hefty fines!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Deadlines for Self-Assessment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing a deadline can lead to fines, so <strong>mark these dates in your calendar!</strong> 📌 <strong>5 October</strong> – Register for Self-Assessment (if it’s your first time filing). 📌 <strong>31 October</strong> – Paper tax return deadline. 📌 <strong>31 January</strong> – Online tax return deadline <strong>&amp; payment deadline</strong> for any tax owed. 📌 <strong>31 July</strong> – Payment deadline for <strong>second payment on account</strong> (if applicable).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Penalties for Late Filing:</strong> ❌ £100 fine for filing <strong>1 day late</strong>. ❌ Additional fines if over <strong>3 months late</strong>. ❌ Interest on unpaid tax—HMRC doesn’t forget!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to File a Self-Assessment Tax Return</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1️⃣ <strong>Register with HMRC</strong> – If this is your first time, register for Self-Assessment and get your <strong>Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)</strong>. 2️⃣ <strong>Gather Your Financial Records</strong> – This includes <strong>income, expenses, invoices, bank statements, and P60s/P45s</strong> if employed. 3️⃣ <strong>Claim Allowable Expenses</strong> – Business owners can deduct costs like travel, home office expenses, equipment, and more. 4️⃣ <strong>Calculate Your Tax Liability</strong> – HMRC will determine what you owe based on your reported income and expenses. 5️⃣ <strong>Submit Your Return</strong> – File online through <strong>HMRC’s portal</strong> or let an <strong>accountant do it for you</strong>. 6️⃣ <strong>Pay Your Tax Bill</strong> – Ensure payments are made on time to <strong>avoid penalties</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Need an Accountant Like Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Filing a tax return might seem simple, but <strong>one mistake can cost you hundreds or even thousands of pounds</strong>.

However, HMRC has significantly changed its approach to reviewing claims, and <strong>software companies are now facing tougher scrutiny than ever before</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is writing code, developing systems, or building software platforms, it’s more important than ever to understand how these changes affect your eligibility—and your risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The R&amp;D Relief Landscape Is Changing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>R&amp;D tax relief was designed to reward companies solving <strong>genuine technical or scientific problems</strong>. In principle, that includes qualifying software development—especially when creating new systems, overcoming technological limitations, or advancing existing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HMRC has grown increasingly concerned that <strong>too many software R&amp;D claims are of poor quality, lacking evidence, or simply incorrect</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, they have significantly tightened enforcement:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>More in-depth investigations and audits</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Longer delays in processing claims</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reassessment and clawback of previously approved claims</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These developments mean <strong>the burden of proof is now much higher</strong>—and your business needs to be prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What HMRC Expects Now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Submitting a successful claim is no longer just about describing innovation. HMRC is placing a strong emphasis on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Documented technical uncertainty</strong>: You must show the work tackled challenges that were not readily solvable by competent professionals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Detailed technical reports</strong>: These must clearly explain the problem, your approach, and the breakthroughs involved.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Clear cost attribution</strong>: There should be transparent links between your R&amp;D activities and the qualifying expenditure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your project doesn&#8217;t meet these standards—or if the supporting evidence is weak—your claim may be delayed, denied, or even investigated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Rules in 2024: Even Stricter for Software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 updates to the R&amp;D scheme introduce <strong>even stricter compliance requirements</strong>—particularly for software firms. Key changes include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mandatory digital submissions</strong> with more granular detail</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Greater emphasis on contemporaneous record-keeping</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tighter definitions of qualifying R&amp;D activities</strong>, especially around routine development or commercially-driven projects</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, <strong>claims that may have previously been accepted are now at far greater risk of rejection or challenge</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Risks of Getting It Wrong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of an unsuccessful claim isn’t just a missed refund. Businesses may also face:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unexpected tax bills</strong>, if claims are clawed back</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interest and penalties</strong> on disallowed claims</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Full-scale HMRC investigations</strong>, which can be time-consuming and disruptive</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For many tech firms, especially SMEs, this could pose a serious threat to cash flow and business continuity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Supports Software Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping technology and software companies <strong>secure R&amp;D relief safely, strategically, and compliantly</strong>.

But DIY accounting requires time, effort, and a good understanding of financial regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of DIY Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Cost-Saving (Initially)</strong> – No fees for professional services. ✅ <strong>Control Over Finances</strong> – You manage everything yourself. ✅ <strong>Better Understanding of Business Finances</strong> – Hands-on involvement in transactions and cash flow. ✅ <strong>Useful for Sole Traders &amp; Small Businesses</strong> – If your transactions are simple, DIY accounting might work—at least in the early stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages of DIY Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Time-Consuming</strong> – Managing books, payroll, and tax returns takes valuable time away from running your business. ❌ <strong>Risk of Errors</strong> – Incorrect tax filings, missing deductions, or miscalculations can lead to fines and penalties. ❌ <strong>Limited Tax Knowledge</strong> – You might miss out on tax-saving opportunities simply because you’re unaware of them. ❌ <strong>Staying Compliant is Hard</strong> – Keeping up with ever-changing tax laws and regulations can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hiring an Accountant – Why It’s Worth It</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing in a <strong>professional accountant</strong> can <strong>save you money, reduce stress, and free up your time</strong> to focus on growing your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of Hiring an Accountant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Saves You Time &amp; Effort</strong> – No more late nights stressing over numbers; focus on what you do best! ✅ <strong>Reduces Tax Bills</strong> – An accountant ensures you <strong>claim all eligible expenses and deductions</strong> to minimise your tax liability. ✅ <strong>Avoids Costly Mistakes</strong> – Incorrect tax filings can lead to penalties. Accountants ensure accuracy and compliance with HMRC. ✅ <strong>Financial Planning &amp; Growth Support</strong> – Get expert advice on business growth, investments, and tax efficiency. ✅ <strong>Simplifies VAT, Payroll &amp; PAYE</strong> – Managing VAT returns, payroll, and PAYE is much easier with professional support. ✅ <strong>Ensures Compliance</strong> – Stay up to date with tax changes, Making Tax Digital (MTD), and government schemes. ✅ <strong>Better Access to Finance</strong> – Accountants help prepare financial statements and business plans for funding applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages of Hiring an Accountant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Comes at a Cost</strong> – Professional services aren’t free, but they often save more than they cost in tax efficiency and avoided penalties. ❌ <strong>Less Hands-On Control</strong> – Some business owners prefer to manage every aspect of their finances themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Does an Accountant Cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of hiring an accountant varies depending on the services you need. Here’s a general guide: 📌 <strong>Self-Assessment Tax Return</strong> – £150-£300 📌 <strong>Limited Company Accounts &amp; Tax Filing</strong> – £500-£1,500 📌 <strong>VAT Returns</strong> – £100-£300 per quarter 📌 <strong>Payroll Services</strong> – £10-£50 per employee per month 📌 <strong>Full Accounting Support</strong> – £1,000+ per year (varies by business size and complexity)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s an additional expense, an accountant <strong>often saves you more in tax efficiencies than they cost</strong>! Think of it as an investment in you and your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Should You Hire an Accountant?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering whether you should <strong>switch from DIY to professional accounting</strong>, here are some signs it’s time to bring in expert help: 🔹 <strong>Your business is growing</strong> – More transactions mean more complexity. 🔹 <strong>You’re struggling with tax returns</strong> – If tax season feels overwhelming, an accountant can save you time and money. 🔹 <strong>You’re unsure about VAT &amp; PAYE</strong> – Tax obligations get more complicated as you scale. 🔹 <strong>You need financial advice</strong> – Planning for growth, securing funding, or making strategic decisions? An accountant is invaluable. 🔹 <strong>You want to avoid fines &amp; penalties</strong> – Compliance mistakes can be costly—expert help keeps you safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Verdict: DIY or Hire an Accountant?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 If you have <strong>a small, simple business</strong> and are comfortable with numbers, DIY accounting might work <strong>in the short term</strong>. 📌 If your business is <strong>growing, dealing with VAT, payroll, or complex tax matters</strong>, hiring an accountant will <strong>save time, reduce stress, and optimise tax efficiency</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses <strong>save time, cut tax bills, and stay compliant</strong> while providing expert financial guidance.

      "content": "\n<p>Managing <strong>payroll and PAYE</strong> (Pay As You Earn) can feel overwhelming for UK employers, but it doesn’t have to be! Ensuring that your employees are paid correctly and on time while staying compliant with <strong>HMRC regulations</strong> is essential for running a smooth and stress-free business. At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make payroll simple, helping businesses avoid costly mistakes and keep their employees happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break it down!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is PAYE?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is <strong>HMRC’s system for collecting Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs)</strong> from employees&#8217; wages. As an employer, it’s your responsibility to: ✅ Deduct <strong>Income Tax and NICs</strong> from employees’ wages. ✅ Report payroll information to HMRC through <strong>Real-Time Information (RTI)</strong>. ✅ Pay HMRC the tax and NICs owed <strong>by the deadline</strong> each month or quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your employees earn <strong>above £123 per week</strong>, you must <strong>register for PAYE</strong> and follow HMRC payroll rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Setting Up Payroll – What You Need to Do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure smooth payroll processing, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Register as an Employer with HMRC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before paying staff, you must <strong>register your business for PAYE</strong> through HMRC. This should be done at least <strong>two weeks before</strong> your first payday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Choose Payroll Software</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To handle PAYE calculations, reporting, and compliance, use HMRC-approved <strong>payroll software</strong> such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Xero Payroll</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>QuickBooks Payroll</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BrightPay</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HMRC’s Basic PAYE Tools (for smaller businesses)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Payroll software <strong>automates deductions, tracks payments, and ensures compliance with RTI reporting</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Collect and Maintain Employee Information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure you have the following details for each employee: ✅ <strong>Full Name and Address</strong> ✅ <strong>National Insurance Number</strong> ✅ <strong>Tax Code</strong> (provided by HMRC or from a P45) ✅ <strong>Bank Details</strong> (for salary payments) ✅ <strong>Start Date and Salary Details</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Payroll Deductions Explained</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each time you run payroll, you must deduct:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Income Tax</strong> – Based on the employee’s tax code and salary.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>National Insurance Contributions (NICs)</strong> – Paid by both the employee and employer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Student Loan Repayments</strong> (if applicable).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pension Contributions</strong> (if your business is part of an auto-enrolment scheme).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once calculated, deductions must be reported to HMRC via <strong>RTI submissions</strong> before payday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Payroll Deadlines and Reporting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay compliant, you must: ✅ <strong>Submit Full Payment Submissions (FPS)</strong> to HMRC <strong>on or before payday</strong>. ✅ <strong>Pay PAYE liabilities to HMRC</strong> by the <strong>22nd of the following month</strong> (or the 19th if paying by cheque). ✅ <strong>Keep payroll records for at least 3 years</strong>, as HMRC may audit your payroll at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing payroll deadlines could result in <strong>penalties</strong>, so it’s essential to stay on top of reporting and payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What About Auto-Enrolment for Pensions?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have <strong>eligible employees</strong>, you must <strong>enrol them into a workplace pension scheme</strong> under <strong>auto-enrolment rules</strong>. Employers must: ✅ Deduct pension contributions from employee wages. ✅ Make employer contributions (minimum 3% of salary). ✅ Register with a compliant pension provider (e.g., Nest, The People’s Pension). ✅ Provide employees with <strong>opt-in and opt-out options</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to comply with auto-enrolment rules can lead to <strong>fines from The Pensions Regulator</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits-in-Kind (BIK) and Payroll</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some employers provide additional perks to employees, known as <strong>benefits-in-kind (BIK)</strong>. These can include: ✅ <strong>Company cars</strong> ✅ <strong>Private health insurance</strong> ✅ <strong>Gym memberships</strong> ✅ <strong>Interest-free loans</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BIKs are subject to <strong>Income Tax and National Insurance</strong>, and must be reported to HMRC via a <strong>P11D form</strong> or through payroll. Employers may also have to pay <strong>Class 1A NICs</strong> on these benefits. It’s essential to track and report benefits correctly to avoid unexpected tax liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) and Payroll</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business operates in the <strong>construction industry</strong>, you may need to comply with the <strong>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong>. Under CIS: ✅ Contractors must <strong>deduct tax at source</strong> (20% or 30%) from subcontractor payments and pass it to HMRC. ✅ Subcontractors must <strong>register for CIS</strong> to receive lower tax deductions. ✅ Employers must <strong>file monthly CIS returns</strong> to report payments and deductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to follow CIS rules can lead to penalties and cash flow issues for subcontractors. If you’re involved in construction, <strong>getting CIS right is crucial</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing a PAYE Scheme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business no longer needs to operate a PAYE scheme—perhaps due to ceasing trading, restructuring, or no longer having employees—you must formally <strong>close it with HMRC</strong>. To do this: ✅ Submit a <strong>final Full Payment Submission (FPS)</strong>, marking it as the last payroll submission. ✅ <strong>Inform HMRC</strong> through your payroll software or by contacting them directly. ✅ Set your <strong>payroll scheme status to ‘ceased’</strong> in your software. ✅ <strong>Settle any outstanding PAYE liabilities</strong> to avoid penalties. ✅ <strong>Retain payroll records for at least 3 years</strong>, as HMRC may request them in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once these steps are completed, HMRC will confirm the closure, ensuring you remain compliant and avoid unnecessary administrative burdens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Payroll Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Incorrect Tax Codes</strong> – Leads to underpaid or overpaid tax, requiring corrections. ❌ <strong>Late RTI Submissions</strong> – Can result in HMRC fines. ❌ <strong>Missing PAYE Deadlines</strong> – Late payments attract penalties and interest charges. ❌ <strong>Not Issuing Payslips</strong> – Employers must provide employees with a detailed payslip each payday. ❌ <strong>Failing to Keep Payroll Records</strong> – HMRC requires businesses to maintain payroll records for <strong>at least 3 years</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Payroll and PAYE don’t have to be a headache. At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we: ✅ <strong>Handle payroll processing</strong> to ensure employees are paid correctly and on time. ✅ <strong>Manage PAYE compliance</strong> so you avoid HMRC penalties. ✅ <strong>Advise on payroll software</strong> to automate and simplify the process. ✅ <strong>Ensure pension auto-enrolment compliance</strong> to meet your legal obligations. ✅ <strong>Assist with Benefits-in-Kind reporting</strong> to avoid unnecessary tax charges. ✅ <strong>Help construction businesses navigate CIS compliance</strong> to prevent fines and cash flow issues. ✅ <strong>Assist in closing PAYE schemes correctly</strong>, ensuring full compliance with HMRC requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We take the stress out of payroll, so you can focus on running your business with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 <strong>Get in touch today</strong> and let us handle your payroll, so you don’t have to!</p>\n",

Get it wrong, and you could face hefty backdated VAT bills or penalties. Let’s explore why this matters—and how to stay on the right side of HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The VAT Split: Education vs. Leisure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In UK VAT law, <strong>membership organisations</strong> are broadly split into two camps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>📚 <strong>Education &amp; training bodies</strong> – often <strong>VAT-exempt</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>💪 <strong>Leisure &amp; fitness providers</strong> – typically subject to the <strong>standard 20% VAT rate</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the difference seems clear. But in practice, things can get&#8230; well, <em>messy</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What If You Do Both?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A <strong>yoga studio</strong> that also offers <strong>accredited teacher training</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>business club</strong> combining <strong>networking events</strong> with <strong>educational workshops</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>fitness centre</strong> hosting <strong>personal development courses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where exactly do these fall? That’s where the trouble starts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This grey area has been the subject of <strong>numerous HMRC investigations</strong>—with some organisations being slapped with <strong>millions in backdated VAT</strong>, and others successfully fighting for their <strong>education-based exemptions</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real-World Examples: What Counts as What?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break it down:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>VAT Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>🧘 Yoga class</td><td>Leisure = 20% VAT</td></tr><tr><td>🎓 Accredited teacher training</td><td>Education = VAT-exempt</td></tr><tr><td>💼 Business coaching with networking</td><td>Mixed = Complex treatment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge? If you&#8217;re providing <strong>blended services</strong>, you may need to <strong>apportion your fees</strong>—treating part as VAT-exempt and part as VATable. This requires careful documentation and often bespoke structuring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s at Stake if You Misjudge It?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Misclassifying your VAT status could mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>🚨 Paying <strong>unexpected VAT</strong> on past income</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🚨 Facing <strong>HMRC penalties</strong> and interest charges</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🚨 Accidentally <strong>overcharging your members</strong> with unnecessary VAT</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just a numbers game—it’s a compliance issue that could seriously dent your cash flow and reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping <strong>membership organisations</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Identify whether your services fall under <strong>education or leisure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Structure memberships</strong> to be as <strong>VAT-efficient</strong> as possible</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Stay fully <strong>compliant</strong>—so you avoid HMRC surprises and costly reclaims</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We speak your language—whether you&#8217;re teaching yoga, hosting masterminds, or training future leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Guess.

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we believe that <strong>understanding financial rules is the key to long-term success</strong>, and today we’re tackling one of the biggest misconceptions among business owners and directors:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“My company’s money is my money.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a limited company director and you think you can dip into company funds whenever you like, you could be setting yourself up for <strong>serious financial and legal consequences.</strong> Let’s break it down and explain how to pay yourself <em>properly</em> while staying compliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “As a Director, I Can Spend Company Money However I Like”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many business owners assume that because they run the company, they can freely access company money for personal expenses. It’s <strong>your</strong> company, so it’s <strong>your</strong> money, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wrong!</strong> Your limited company is a <strong>separate legal entity</strong>, meaning its money <strong>does not</strong> automatically belong to you. If you take company money incorrectly, you could face <strong>tax penalties, HMRC scrutiny, and even legal issues.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Reality: Your Company’s Money is NOT Your Personal Money</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>limited company is legally separate from its directors and shareholders</strong>. This means the money in the company belongs to the business, not you personally. Taking money out the wrong way could be seen as <strong>tax evasion</strong> or even misappropriation of funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how <em>can</em> you legally pay yourself from your company? Let’s look at the <strong>right</strong> ways to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Right Ways to Pay Yourself as a Director</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Salary (Through PAYE)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common ways to withdraw money from your company is by paying yourself a salary through <strong>Pay As You Earn (PAYE).</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You must register your company for PAYE with HMRC.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your salary is subject to <strong>Income Tax and National Insurance.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many directors choose to pay themselves <strong>a small salary below the National Insurance threshold</strong> to reduce tax liability while still qualifying for a state pension.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Dividends (For Shareholders)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a shareholder in your company, you can pay yourself <strong>dividends</strong> from company profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Dividends are taxed at lower rates</strong> than salary payments, making them a tax-efficient way to pay yourself.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You <strong>can’t</strong> pay dividends if your company isn’t making a profit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividends must be <strong>formally declared</strong> and recorded with proper documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Director’s Loan (If Used Correctly!)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> borrow money from your company in the form of a <strong>director’s loan</strong>, but be careful:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you take out a loan over <strong>£10,000</strong>, it <strong>must be declared on your Self-Assessment tax return and may be subject to additional tax.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you don’t repay a director’s loan within <strong>9 months of your company’s year-end</strong>, HMRC will charge <strong>extra Corporation Tax (32.5%) on the outstanding amount.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Claiming Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve paid for legitimate <strong>business expenses</strong> with personal funds, you can claim this money back from the company <strong>tax-free.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep <strong>detailed records and receipts</strong> to justify expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure all claimed expenses are <strong>wholly and exclusively for business purposes.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Dangers of Taking Company Money Incorrectly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you treat company money as your own <strong>without following the right process</strong>, you could face serious consequences:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax Penalties</strong> – HMRC can charge penalties, backdated tax, and interest on improperly withdrawn funds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Legal Trouble</strong> – Taking company money without proper documentation could be classed as fraud or mismanagement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cash Flow Problems</strong> – Uncontrolled withdrawals can leave your company struggling to pay suppliers, employees, or even HMRC tax bills.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HMRC Investigations</strong> – Improper payments often trigger tax audits, which can be stressful, time-consuming, and expensive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Smart Approach: Stay Compliant &amp; Maximise Tax Efficiency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? Paying yourself the right way can actually <strong>save you money on tax and keep your business financially healthy.</strong> By working with an experienced accountant, you can:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Set up a <strong>tax-efficient salary and dividend strategy</strong> ✅ Ensure <strong>director’s loans are managed correctly</strong> ✅ Claim the <strong>right business expenses</strong> without HMRC issues ✅ Stay fully <strong>compliant with tax and legal obligations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Fall for This Costly Myth – Get Expert Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help business owners take <strong>full control of their finances</strong> while staying compliant.

      "content": "\n<p>If you’re a business owner in the UK, understanding <strong>Value Added Tax (VAT)</strong> is crucial. Whether you’re a sole trader, a small business, or a growing company, VAT can seem overwhelming at first—but don’t worry, we’re here to break it down for you! At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses like yours navigate VAT with confidence, ensuring compliance while maximising tax efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is VAT?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT is a <strong>consumption tax</strong> levied on most goods and services sold in the UK. Businesses <strong>collect VAT on behalf of HMRC</strong> and then pass it on through their VAT return. If your business is VAT-registered, you’ll charge VAT on your sales (output VAT) and reclaim VAT on purchases (input VAT), potentially reducing your overall tax liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Needs to Register for VAT?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT registration is <strong>compulsory</strong> if: ✅ Your <strong>taxable turnover</strong> exceeds <strong>£90,000</strong> in a rolling 12-month period (2024/25 threshold). ✅ You expect your turnover to exceed this threshold within the next 30 days. ✅ You buy goods from the EU worth more than £85,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also register <strong>voluntarily</strong> if your turnover is below this threshold, which can be beneficial in certain cases—more on this later!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT Rates in the UK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different goods and services attract different VAT rates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Standard Rate (20%)</strong> – Most goods and services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced Rate (5%)</strong> – Includes home energy, children’s car seats, and some health products.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Zero Rate (0%)</strong> – Includes most food, books, children’s clothes, and newspapers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Exempt &amp; Outside the Scope</strong> – Financial services, education, and insurance are often VAT-exempt, meaning no VAT is charged or reclaimed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding which VAT rate applies to your business is crucial for accurate VAT reporting and compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does VAT Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once VAT-registered, your business must: ✅ <strong>Charge VAT</strong> on sales (output VAT). ✅ <strong>Reclaim VAT</strong> on business expenses (input VAT). ✅ <strong>File VAT returns</strong> (usually every quarter) to report VAT collected and reclaimed. ✅ <strong>Pay HMRC the difference</strong> between output VAT and input VAT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you reclaim more VAT than you collect, HMRC will issue you a refund—nice, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT Schemes to Be Aware Of</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC offers several <strong>VAT schemes</strong> to simplify accounting and improve cash flow:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Flat Rate Scheme</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Pay a fixed percentage of turnover instead of tracking input VAT. ✅ Suitable for businesses with a turnover of <strong>£150,000 or less</strong>. ✅ Can save time and money for businesses with few VATable expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Cash Accounting Scheme</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Pay VAT only when you receive payments (rather than when you invoice clients). ✅ Helps businesses improve cash flow. ✅ Available to businesses with turnover up to <strong>£1.35 million</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Annual Accounting Scheme</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Submit <strong>one VAT return per year</strong> instead of quarterly returns. ✅ Make fixed interim payments to manage cash flow. ✅ Available for businesses with turnover up to <strong>£1.35 million</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each scheme has <strong>pros and cons</strong>, so choosing the right one is key to <strong>optimising your VAT position</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making Tax Digital (MTD) and VAT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government introduced <strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong> to streamline tax administration and reduce errors. Under MTD for VAT: ✅ Businesses with a taxable turnover above the <strong>VAT threshold (£90,000)</strong> must keep digital records and submit VAT returns using MTD-compatible software. ✅ Even if your business is <strong>below the VAT threshold</strong>, voluntary MTD registration can help future-proof your business and improve record-keeping. ✅ MTD ensures better accuracy, reduces paperwork, and makes VAT compliance easier for businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to comply with MTD rules could result in penalties, so it’s essential to use <strong>compliant software</strong> and stay on top of your digital record-keeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Accountancy Software Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the right <strong>accountancy software</strong> can make VAT compliance <strong>much easier</strong>. Cloud-based accounting platforms like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, and FreeAgent</strong> help businesses: ✅ <strong>Automatically calculate VAT</strong> on transactions. ✅ <strong>Generate VAT reports</strong> and submit returns directly to HMRC. ✅ <strong>Track expenses and income</strong> in real time, improving financial oversight. ✅ <strong>Integrate with banking and invoicing tools</strong> for a seamless workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using modern accounting software, you can reduce the risk of errors, save time, and ensure compliance with <strong>MTD and VAT regulations</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common VAT Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Not registering on time</strong> – You may face penalties if you exceed the threshold and fail to register. ❌ <strong>Incorrect VAT rates</strong> – Charging the wrong VAT rate can lead to errors and possible HMRC investigations. ❌ <strong>Claiming VAT on ineligible expenses</strong> – Some items, like entertainment costs, are not VAT-recoverable. ❌ <strong>Missing VAT return deadlines</strong> – Late submissions can result in fines and interest charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT doesn’t have to be complicated. At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we: ✅ <strong>Help you register for VAT</strong> (or assess if voluntary registration makes sense for you). ✅ <strong>Advise on the best VAT scheme</strong> for your business. ✅ <strong>Ensure compliance</strong> so you avoid costly mistakes. ✅ <strong>Handle VAT returns and reporting</strong> so you can focus on growing your business. ✅ <strong>Provide guidance on MTD and accounting software</strong> to streamline your VAT process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding VAT is essential, but you don’t have to do it alone. Let’s make sure your business is <strong>VAT-efficient, compliant, and stress-free</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 <strong>Get in touch today</strong> to discuss your VAT needs—we’re here to help!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we understand that managing financial records is an essential part of running a business. But with <strong>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</strong> in full force, ensuring compliance with <strong>data protection laws</strong> is just as critical as keeping your accounts in order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to comply with GDPR can result in <strong>hefty fines, reputational damage, and legal consequences</strong>. So, how can you ensure that your financial records are <strong>secure, compliant, and properly managed</strong>? Let’s dive in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is GDPR and Why Does It Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GDPR is a set of <strong>data protection laws</strong> designed to safeguard personal data and ensure individuals have control over their information. This applies to any business that collects, stores, or processes personal data—including <strong>financial records, payroll details, invoices, and tax documents</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-compliance with GDPR can result in fines of up to <strong>€20 million or 4% of annual global turnover</strong>—whichever is higher. It’s a <strong>big deal</strong>, and businesses must take the right steps to ensure compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Steps to Ensure GDPR Compliance in Your Financial Records</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Understand What Personal Data You Hold</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in GDPR compliance is knowing exactly <strong>what data you store, where it’s kept, and how it’s used</strong>. Personal financial data includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Employee payroll records</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Client invoices and payment details</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supplier banking information</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tax records containing personal identifiers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>➡️ <strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a <strong>data audit</strong> to map out all financial records that contain personal information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Implement Strong Data Security Measures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting financial data is essential to prevent <strong>unauthorised access, leaks, or cyber threats</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Use <strong>encryption</strong> to secure sensitive financial information. ✅ Restrict access to financial records—only authorised personnel should handle them. ✅ Store data on <strong>secure, GDPR-compliant cloud platforms</strong> like Xero and A2X. ✅ Implement <strong>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong> for added security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➡️ <strong>Action:</strong> Regularly update passwords and security measures to prevent breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Set Clear Data Retention Policies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under GDPR, businesses must only keep personal data for as long as <strong>necessary</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>HMRC requires financial records to be kept for at least 6 years</strong>, but once that period is over, <strong>data must be securely deleted</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➡️ <strong>Action:</strong> Create a <strong>data retention policy</strong> and ensure outdated records are removed properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Obtain Consent and Be Transparent</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you collect personal financial data, you must inform clients, employees, and suppliers <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> their data is used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Provide a <strong>privacy notice</strong> explaining how financial data is processed. ✅ Obtain <strong>explicit consent</strong> where required (e.g., storing customer payment details for recurring billing). ✅ Ensure contracts with third-party financial service providers include <strong>GDPR-compliant terms</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➡️ <strong>Action:</strong> Review all agreements to ensure <strong>full transparency and compliance</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Be Ready for Data Requests and Breaches</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under GDPR, individuals have the right to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Access their financial records</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Request corrections to errors</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ask for data to be deleted (where applicable)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s a <strong>data breach</strong>, businesses must notify the <strong>ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office)</strong> within <strong>72 hours</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➡️ <strong>Action:</strong> Establish a <strong>GDPR response plan</strong> to handle data requests and potential breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying GDPR compliant while managing financial records doesn’t have to be a headache. At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses: ✅ Implement <strong>GDPR-compliant accounting processes</strong> ✅ Use secure, cloud-based software like <strong>Xero and A2X</strong> ✅ Develop <strong>data retention and security policies</strong> ✅ Ensure <strong>compliance with HMRC and GDPR regulations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By working with us, you can <strong>focus on growing your business</strong> while having peace of mind that your financial data is <strong>protected, secure, and compliant</strong>.</p>\n",

At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses stay <strong>compliant, tax-efficient, and financially secure</strong>—and today, we’re tackling a common payroll misconception: <em>“Bonuses and benefits aren’t taxed like salaries.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many employers and employees assume that <strong>bonuses and perks</strong> are treated differently from regular wages when it comes to <strong>PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax and National Insurance (NI).</strong> <strong>Spoiler alert: they’re not!</strong> In fact, HMRC considers bonuses and most employee benefits as <strong>taxable income</strong>, and failing to handle them correctly can result in hefty tax bills or penalties. Let’s break it down!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “Bonuses and Benefits Have Different Tax Rules Than Salaries”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a common belief that bonuses are taxed at a <strong>different rate</strong> than regular salaries, or that benefits like <strong>company cars, private healthcare, or gift cards</strong> are somehow tax-free. <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s a <strong>cash bonus, a staff discount, or a non-cash perk</strong>, <strong>HMRC wants its share.</strong> The way these extra rewards are taxed depends on their type, but <strong>they are almost always taxable in some form.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Reality: Bonuses and Benefits Are Taxed Like Salaries (With Some Variations)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC treats <strong>cash bonuses, commissions, and benefits-in-kind</strong> as additional income, which means they are subject to <strong>Income Tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Cash Bonuses &amp; Commissions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Cash bonuses are <strong>added to an employee’s salary</strong> and taxed through PAYE in the <strong>same way as regular wages</strong>. ✅ They are subject to <strong>Income Tax at the employee’s usual rate</strong> (20%, 40%, or 45%). ✅ They also attract <strong>Employer and Employee National Insurance contributions (NICs)</strong>. ✅ Because bonuses are often paid in a lump sum, <strong>they can push an employee into a higher tax bracket for that pay period</strong>—resulting in a <strong>higher tax deduction at source.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> An employee earning £30,000 receives a £3,000 Christmas bonus. That bonus will be taxed <strong>exactly like salary</strong>, with PAYE and NICs deducted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Non-Cash Benefits (Benefits-in-Kind)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some perks aren’t paid in cash but still count as <strong>taxable benefits</strong>. These include: ✅ <strong>Company cars</strong> ✅ <strong>Private medical insurance</strong> ✅ <strong>Interest-free loans over £10,000</strong> ✅ <strong>Gym memberships, season ticket loans, and childcare vouchers</strong> (outside HMRC-approved schemes) ✅ <strong>Gift cards or vouchers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these benefits <strong>must be reported on a P11D form</strong>, and either <strong>the employer or employee</strong> will need to pay tax on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If an employer provides an employee with a company car for personal use, the employee will <strong>pay tax on the “Benefit in Kind” (BIK) value</strong> of the vehicle, and the employer will pay <strong>Class 1A NICs</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Tax-Free Benefits (The Exceptions!)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some employee perks <strong>are tax-free</strong> as long as they meet certain HMRC conditions: ✅ <strong>Trivial benefits</strong> (e.g., a staff birthday gift worth under £50, with no cash element) ✅ <strong>Employer pension contributions</strong> (up to HMRC limits) ✅ <strong>Work-related training</strong> ✅ <strong>Cycle-to-Work schemes</strong> ✅ <strong>Annual staff parties (up to £150 per head)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Risks of Getting It Wrong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring tax rules on bonuses and benefits can lead to serious trouble: ❌ <strong>Unexpected tax bills for employees</strong> – If benefits aren’t reported correctly, employees may owe extra tax at year-end. ❌ <strong>Employer penalties from HMRC</strong> – If bonuses or benefits are not reported and taxed correctly, HMRC can issue fines and demand backdated tax. ❌ <strong>Increased National Insurance liability</strong> – Employers who fail to account for NI on benefits may face <strong>higher NIC bills</strong> than expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Manage Bonus &amp; Benefit Tax Correctly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? <strong>Managing PAYE, bonuses, and benefits correctly doesn’t have to be complicated!</strong> Here’s how to stay compliant:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Process all cash bonuses through PAYE</strong> – Deduct tax and NI at the time of payment. ✅ <strong>Report all benefits-in-kind</strong> via P11D forms or include them in payroll if using Payrolling Benefits. ✅ <strong>Understand tax-free perks</strong> – Make the most of HMRC-approved, tax-efficient benefits. ✅ <strong>Work with an Accountant</strong> – A payroll and tax expert ensures you stay compliant, <strong>avoid unnecessary tax liabilities</strong>, and keep your employees happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Bonuses &amp; Benefits Are Taxed—Just Like Salaries!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonuses and perks <strong>aren’t a tax loophole</strong>—HMRC treats them as taxable income. Whether you’re rewarding staff with <strong>cash incentives, company cars, or gym memberships</strong>, understanding <strong>how they’re taxed</strong> ensures your business stays <strong>compliant and tax-efficient</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get Expert Payroll &amp; Benefit Tax Advice Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses <strong>navigate payroll, PAYE, and benefit taxation</strong> with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need help ensuring your bonuses and benefits are taxed correctly?

      "content": "\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we believe in <strong>paying no more tax than necessary</strong>—but always within the boundaries of the law. Tax is a complex subject, and the distinctions between <strong>tax avoidance, tax evasion, and tax efficiency</strong> can sometimes feel blurred. Understanding these differences is crucial, as stepping over the legal line can have <strong>serious consequences</strong>. Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Evasion – Illegal and Risky 🚨</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax evasion is the <strong>deliberate act of illegally reducing or avoiding tax</strong>. This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Underreporting income</strong> – Not declaring all sources of income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Falsifying records</strong> – Manipulating financial documents to reduce tax liability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hiding money offshore</strong> – Using unreported foreign accounts to evade tax.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consequences of Tax Evasion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax evasion is a <strong>criminal offence</strong> in the UK, and HMRC takes it <strong>very seriously</strong>. If caught, individuals or businesses can face:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Heavy fines and penalties</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Criminal prosecution and potential imprisonment</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reputational damage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, tax evasion is <strong>never worth the risk</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Avoidance – Legal but Risky Grey Area ⚠️</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax avoidance involves <strong>exploiting loopholes in the tax system</strong> to reduce liabilities in ways that, while technically legal, are frowned upon by HMRC. Common examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Artificially structuring transactions</strong> to reduce tax liability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Using aggressive tax schemes</strong> designed solely for tax benefits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Excessive use of tax havens</strong> to shift profits offshore.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While tax avoidance is <strong>not illegal</strong>, HMRC actively challenges avoidance schemes, and businesses or individuals caught using them may face:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Retrospective tax bills</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fines and penalties</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Potential legal action</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line? If a scheme seems too good to be true, <strong>it probably is!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Efficiency – Smart, Legal, and Ethical ✅</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax efficiency is the <strong>legitimate way</strong> to reduce tax liabilities by making full use of available reliefs, allowances, and government incentives. Examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Claiming allowable business expenses</strong> – Ensuring all eligible costs are deducted before tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maximising pension contributions</strong> – Contributions reduce taxable income and benefit retirement planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Using tax-efficient investment schemes</strong> – Such as ISAs, SEIS, and EIS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Structuring your business tax-efficiently</strong> – Using the right mix of salary, dividends, and tax allowances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping businesses and individuals legally minimise their tax burden while staying firmly on the <strong>right side of the law</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Staying Compliant is Crucial</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While <strong>nobody wants to pay more tax than they need to</strong>, it’s vital to remain compliant with UK tax laws. Falling into the trap of avoidance or evasion can lead to serious financial and legal repercussions. A tax strategy should be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ethical and transparent</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fully compliant with HMRC regulations</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sustainable for long-term financial health</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in <strong>helping our clients pay the right amount of tax—no more, no less</strong>. Our expert team can assist with: ✅ <strong>Tax-efficient business structuring</strong> – Helping you choose the best setup for minimal tax liability. ✅ <strong>Personal and corporate tax planning</strong> – Ensuring you take advantage of all available reliefs and allowances. ✅ <strong>HMRC compliance and risk reduction</strong> – Making sure you stay clear of any tax avoidance pitfalls. ✅ <strong>Peace of mind</strong> – Sleep easy knowing you are tax-efficient, compliant, and protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to <strong>optimise your tax position legally and ethically</strong>, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get in touch with Black &amp; White Accounting today</strong>—because paying no more tax than necessary should never mean losing sleep at night! 😴💡</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that no business—big or small—should underestimate the power of expert financial guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest myths we hear? <em>“Hiring an accountant is only for big businesses.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re an SME or a startup, thinking you can handle everything on your own might seem cost-effective—but in reality, not having an accountant could be costing you <em>more</em> in lost opportunities, tax inefficiencies, and financial missteps. Let’s set the record straight!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why SMEs Need an Accountant More Than Ever</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Small businesses and startups actually <em>benefit the most</em> from professional accounting support. Unlike big corporations with in-house finance teams, SMEs often rely on a single person (usually the business owner) to juggle everything—from sales and marketing to operations and, yes, accounting. But without expert guidance, this can lead to costly mistakes, unnecessary tax bills, and missed opportunities for growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s why having an accountant in your corner is a game-changer:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Maximising Tax Efficiency</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you sure you’re claiming all the expenses, deductions, and tax reliefs you’re entitled to? An accountant ensures you’re not overpaying HMRC, helping you retain more of your hard-earned profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Saving You Time (So You Can Focus on Growth)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time spent wrestling with tax returns, bookkeeping, and compliance paperwork is time <em>not</em> spent on growing your business. An accountant takes these tasks off your plate, giving you back precious hours to focus on what really matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Helping You Avoid Expensive Mistakes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late tax filings? Incorrect VAT returns? Mismanaged cash flow? Even small errors can have big financial consequences. An accountant helps you stay compliant, avoid fines, and keep your finances in check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Providing Financial Clarity &amp; Strategic Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a clear financial roadmap for your business? Whether it’s budgeting, forecasting, or securing investment, an accountant gives you the insights and strategies needed to scale efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Supporting Funding &amp; Growth Opportunities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a business loan or looking to attract investors? Accountants prepare professional financial reports and forecasts that make your business more appealing to lenders and stakeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Right Accountant: An Investment, Not an Expense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many small businesses avoid hiring an accountant because they see it as an extra cost. In reality, an accountant <em>saves</em> you money—by optimising your tax position, improving cash flow management, and helping you make smarter financial decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we specialise in supporting SMEs and startups, offering tailored solutions that grow with your business. Whether you’re just starting out or scaling up, we provide the expert guidance you need—without the corporate price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Make the SME Mistake—Get the Support You Deserve</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting isn’t just for big businesses; it’s for <em>smart</em> businesses. If you want to take control of your finances, reduce stress, and set your business up for long-term success, it’s time to bring in the experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in touch with Black &amp; White Accounting today, and let’s build a strong financial future for your business together!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights in our blog series, where we continue to challenge financial myths and empower businesses like yours.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we know that <strong>cash flow</strong> is the lifeblood of any business. Whether you&#8217;re a startup, a growing SME, or an established company, managing cash effectively is crucial for stability and growth. But what can you do if your cash flow isn’t quite where you want it to be? We’ve got you covered! Here are <strong>proven strategies</strong> to improve cash flow and keep your business thriving.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Get Paid Faster</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest cash flow challenges businesses face is delayed payments. Here’s how to speed things up:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Invoice promptly and correctly</strong> – Ensure invoices are accurate, clear, and sent out immediately after work is completed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offer multiple payment options</strong> – Accepting card payments, direct debits, or digital payments makes it easier for clients to pay.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set clear payment terms</strong> – Shorten payment terms where possible (e.g., from 30 days to 14 days) and enforce them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use automated reminders</strong> – Chase overdue payments automatically with cloud accounting software like <strong>Xero</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Cut Unnecessary Costs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Review your expenses regularly to identify areas where you can save money:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Negotiate with suppliers</strong> – See if you can get better payment terms or discounts for bulk purchases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Eliminate non-essential spending</strong> – Cancel unused subscriptions or services that don’t add value.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Monitor fixed vs. variable costs</strong> – Can you switch some fixed costs to variable ones to ease cash flow pressure?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Manage Your Stock Wisely</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Holding too much stock ties up cash unnecessarily. Improve stock control by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reducing slow-moving inventory</strong> – Focus on selling older stock before ordering new supplies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Using just-in-time ordering</strong> – Purchase stock only when needed to avoid excess.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Negotiating better terms with suppliers</strong> – Look for more flexible agreements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Build a Cash Flow Forecast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A solid cash flow forecast helps you anticipate challenges and plan ahead. Use <strong>cloud-based accounting software</strong> to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Predict peaks and troughs</strong> in income and expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plan for seasonal variations</strong> and adjust spending accordingly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify when you might need extra financing</strong> before a crisis hits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Access Finance When Needed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If cash flow gaps occur, <strong>funding options</strong> can provide short-term relief:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Business overdrafts</strong> – A flexible way to cover shortfalls.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invoice financing</strong> – Get paid sooner by borrowing against outstanding invoices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business loans or credit lines</strong> – A structured way to fund growth and cash flow needs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Increase Revenue Streams</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Boosting income helps maintain healthy cash flow:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Upsell and cross-sell</strong> – Encourage customers to purchase more from you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Introduce recurring revenue models</strong> – Memberships, subscriptions, or retainers can provide steady income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review pricing strategy</strong> – Ensure your prices reflect the true value of your services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Plan for Tax Liabilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax payments can be a significant drain on cash flow if not planned properly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Set money aside each month</strong> to cover VAT, PAYE, and Corporation Tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Take advantage of tax reliefs</strong> to reduce liabilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use payment plans if needed</strong> – HMRC may allow businesses to spread payments over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Control of Your Cash Flow Today!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving cash flow isn’t just about having more money in the bank—it’s about <strong>financial security, better decision-making, and sustainable business growth</strong>.

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that the smallest financial decisions can have the biggest impact on your success. Today, we’re addressing a mistake that many new business owners make: <em>using a personal bank account for business transactions.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem like a harmless shortcut, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out, but mixing personal and business finances can lead to serious headaches—and even financial losses—down the line. Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Using a Personal Bank Account for Business is a Bad Idea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tempting to keep things simple by running your business expenses through your personal bank account. But here’s why that approach can cost you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. It Makes Accounting a Nightmare</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine sifting through months of bank statements, trying to separate personal spending from business transactions. Not only does this waste your time, but it also increases the risk of missing tax-deductible expenses—meaning you could be paying more tax than necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. You Could Face Tax &amp; Compliance Issues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC requires businesses to keep clear, accurate financial records. If your business transactions are tangled with personal expenses, you could struggle to prove your tax calculations. In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to fines, penalties, or even an investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. It Damages Your Professional Image</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a personal account for business payments can make your business look unprofessional. Clients, suppliers, and potential investors may see this as a red flag, questioning your financial credibility and long-term stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. You Might Miss Out on Financial Benefits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A business bank account doesn’t just keep things organised—it also unlocks access to business loans, credit facilities, and financial services that personal accounts simply don’t offer. If you ever need funding to grow, having a dedicated business account could be essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. It Puts Your Personal Finances at Risk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a sole trader, using a personal account blurs the line between you and your business. This can lead to personal financial exposure if your business runs into difficulties. For limited companies, keeping finances separate is a legal requirement—so ignoring this rule could have legal consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution? Open a Business Bank Account ASAP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that opening a business bank account is easier than ever. Many banks offer tailored options for small businesses, freelancers, and startups, with low fees and online access. Here’s what you should do:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Register a business bank account as soon as possible</strong> to keep your finances separate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Choose an account with features that suit your needs</strong>, such as invoicing tools, overdraft options, and integrations with accounting software.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work with an accountant</strong> to ensure your financial setup is optimised for tax efficiency and business growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Control of Your Business Finances with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding a business bank account might seem like a minor shortcut, but it can lead to major financial complications down the road. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to streamline your financial processes, having a proper business bank account is a must.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses like yours set up the right financial foundations from day one.

      "content": "\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that insurance is a crucial part of financial planning for both businesses and individuals. But what about the tax implications? Understanding the tax treatment of insurance can help you maximise deductions, remain compliant, and avoid unexpected liabilities. In this blog, we break down everything you need to know about insurance and tax in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Insurance Tax-Deductible?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax treatment of insurance premiums depends on the type of insurance and whether it’s taken out for business or personal purposes. Generally, business-related insurance policies can be deducted as an allowable expense, whereas personal insurance policies usually do not qualify for tax relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Business Insurance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, insurance premiums can be deducted as an allowable expense, provided they are wholly and exclusively for business purposes. Here are some common types of business insurance and their tax treatment:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Employer’s Liability Insurance</strong> – A legal requirement for most businesses, this is tax-deductible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Public Liability Insurance</strong> – Protecting against claims from third parties, this is an allowable business expense.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Professional Indemnity Insurance</strong> – A must-have for many professionals, including accountants and consultants, and fully tax-deductible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Property Insurance</strong> – Covering business premises, stock, and equipment, this is also tax-deductible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Key Person Insurance</strong> – This type of insurance protects businesses against financial loss caused by the death or illness of a crucial team member. However, HMRC may scrutinise its tax deductibility, depending on who benefits from the payout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal Insurance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals, most personal insurance premiums are not tax-deductible. This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Life Insurance</strong> – No tax relief on premiums, but beneficiaries may receive a tax-free lump sum.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Health Insurance</strong> – No personal tax deduction, but employer-provided health insurance is considered a taxable benefit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Income Protection Insurance</strong> – No tax relief unless provided as part of a business expense for self-employed individuals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefit-in-Kind (BIK) Implications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a business pays for certain types of insurance policies for employees or directors, these may be considered a <strong>Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)</strong> and could be subject to tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). The implications include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Private Medical Insurance</strong> – If an employer pays for private health insurance, it is considered a BIK, and the employee must pay income tax on the value of the benefit. The employer must also pay Class 1A NICs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Life Insurance (Relevant Life Policies)</strong> – Generally, Relevant Life Policies (RLPs) are not considered a BIK and can be tax-efficient for businesses, as long as they meet certain conditions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Critical Illness Cover</strong> – If a company provides critical illness cover as a benefit, it is usually treated as a BIK and subject to tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Income Protection Insurance</strong> – Employer-paid policies may also be classed as a BIK unless the payout is structured as part of a group scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers must report BIKs through the <strong>P11D form</strong> or via payroll reporting, ensuring employees are taxed appropriately. Businesses should carefully assess the tax efficiency of offering insurance as an employee benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What About Insurance Payouts?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax treatment of insurance payouts depends on the type of policy and who the beneficiary is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Business Insurance Payouts</strong> – Typically taxable if they replace lost income or cover business costs. However, some capital receipts may not be taxable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Life Insurance Payouts</strong> – Usually tax-free for beneficiaries, provided the policy is written in trust.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Health &amp; Income Protection Payouts</strong> – Payments may be tax-free for individuals but could be taxable for businesses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Optimising Your Insurance for Tax Efficiency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the tax treatment of insurance allows businesses and individuals to make informed decisions. Here are some ways to optimise your tax position:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review Business Insurance Policies</strong> – Ensure all business-related insurance is correctly accounted for as a deductible expense.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use Trusts for Life Insurance</strong> – Placing life insurance policies in trust can help avoid inheritance tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider Tax-Efficient Employee Benefits</strong> – Employer-paid health and life insurance policies may have tax advantages when structured correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance is a vital tool for risk management, but understanding its tax implications is equally important. At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses and individuals navigate complex tax issues with clarity and confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need expert advice on tax and insurance?

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we’re all about empowering businesses with knowledge, helping you make informed decisions that fuel growth and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s topic? The idea that accounting software has made accountants obsolete. If you’ve ever thought, <em>“Why pay for an accountant when software can do it all?”</em> – keep reading, because the reality might surprise you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rise of Accounting Software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no doubt that digital accounting software like Xero, QuickBooks, and Sage has revolutionised the way businesses manage their finances. From automating invoices to tracking expenses and even preparing VAT returns, these platforms have made financial management more accessible than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the catch: software is a tool, not a strategy. And relying solely on it could mean missing out on valuable financial insights, tax savings, and compliance essentials that only an experienced accountant can provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Software Can’t Do (That an Accountant Can!)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While accounting software is great at number crunching, it lacks the human expertise and strategic thinking that a seasoned accountant brings to the table. Here’s what software can’t replace:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Strategic Business Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An accountant doesn’t just record your numbers—they analyse them. We help you understand what your financial data means and how you can use it to drive growth, reduce costs, and improve profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tax Efficiency &amp; Compliance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting software can calculate tax, but it won’t tell you about the latest tax-saving opportunities, reliefs, or exemptions that could save you thousands. Nor will it ensure you’re fully compliant with constantly evolving tax laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Personalised Financial Planning</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every business is unique, and a one-size-fits-all software solution doesn’t take into account your specific circumstances, industry regulations, or long-term goals. An accountant tailors financial strategies to your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Handling Complexities &amp; Problem-Solving</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From resolving HMRC inquiries to navigating audits or managing cash flow crises, an accountant provides expert guidance in situations where software simply falls short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Business Growth &amp; Funding Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to scale your business? Need investment or financing? An accountant can help prepare financial reports, forecasts, and business plans that lenders and investors actually want to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Best Approach? A Powerful Partnership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we embrace technology and encourage businesses to leverage digital accounting tools. But we also know that software works best when combined with expert advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of replacing accountants, software enhances what we do—allowing us to focus on strategic advice, problem-solving, and business growth rather than manual data entry. That’s why we work with leading accounting platforms to provide our clients with seamless, tech-driven, yet personalised financial management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Verdict: Software + Accountant = A Winning Formula</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re serious about growing your business, avoiding financial pitfalls, and maximising your profits, software alone won’t cut it. The smartest businesses use software for efficiency—but rely on expert accountants for strategy, compliance, and long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to see the difference an accountant can make? Get in touch with Black &amp; White Accounting today, and let’s take your business finances to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more myth-busting blogs in this series, where we continue to uncover the truth behind common financial misconceptions!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The UK Government is gearing up for the Autumn Budget on Wednesday 30<sup>th</sup> October 2024, which always brings potential changes to the tax landscape. With a change in Government and a change in ideas, changes in the UK tax system seem inevitable. As a forward-thinking accountancy firm, we know that staying informed and proactive is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. Here’s a rundown of some of the potential changes we might see in the upcoming Budget and how they could affect you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Income Tax Adjustments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One area that’s consistently under review in every Budget is personal income tax. Although the Chancellor has previously committed to maintaining the current rates until at least 2026, there is always a possibility that changes could be introduced, especially in light of recent economic challenges. Possible changes could include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adjustment of Income Tax Bands:</strong> There might be a review of the income tax bands, potentially freezing personal allowances, or adjusting the higher-rate threshold. If thresholds are frozen, more individuals could find themselves in higher tax brackets due to wage inflation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>National Insurance Contributions (NICs):</strong> We could see changes to NICs, possibly increasing rates for higher earners or tweaking the thresholds to ensure a more progressive system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> Keeping an eye on these potential changes is essential for budgeting and financial planning, especially if you are self-employed or running a business where income fluctuates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Overhaul</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has been hinting at potential reforms to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for some time now. In the previous Budget announcements, CGT remained largely untouched, but this could change. The following modifications are possible:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Harmonising CGT with Income Tax Rates:</strong> One of the proposals on the table is to align CGT rates more closely with income tax rates, which could lead to higher CGT liabilities for individuals disposing of assets, including property and investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduction of the Annual Exemption:</strong> The annual CGT exemption may be reduced, which means more individuals would face a CGT bill when selling assets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> If you are considering disposing of assets, it may be worth revisiting your plans with an accountant to potentially optimise your CGT position before any changes come into effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Corporation Tax Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporation Tax has been a focal point for the government, especially following the economic effects of the pandemic. While rates rose to up to 25% for businesses with profits over £250,000 from April 2024, there could be further changes in the Budget, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Incentives for Small Businesses:</strong> To support small businesses, the Chancellor might introduce new reliefs or incentives, such as enhanced allowances for capital investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reassessment of R&amp;D Tax Credits:</strong> The government has been reviewing R&amp;D tax credits, which could result in changes to the rates or qualifying expenditure criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> If you run a small business, it’s vital to stay updated on these changes, as they could significantly affect your tax planning and overall profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. VAT Reforms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Value Added Tax (VAT) system is another area that could see reforms in the upcoming Budget. Although changes to VAT rates have a broader impact on the economy, there is speculation around:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Changes to VAT Registration Threshold:</strong> The current threshold of £85,000 could be altered, potentially bringing more small businesses into the VAT system.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sector-Specific VAT Adjustments:</strong> The government might introduce reduced VAT rates for specific sectors, such as hospitality, to continue supporting industries hit hardest by the pandemic. A 20% VAT rate is planned to be introduced on private school fees from 1 January 2025 and it appears unlikely that this will be delayed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> VAT changes can affect pricing, cash flow, and accounting processes, so staying informed is key, especially if your business is close to the registration threshold or operates in a potentially affected sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Inheritance Tax (IHT) Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inheritance Tax (IHT) has long been a contentious topic, and there have been ongoing calls for reform. Potential changes could include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Threshold Freezing:</strong> The IHT nil-rate band may be frozen further, bringing more estates into the tax bracket over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Changes to Reliefs:</strong> Business Property Relief (BPR) and Agricultural Property Relief (APR) could see adjustments to limit the scope of their application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong> If you have an estate or are involved in estate planning, it’s wise to keep an eye on these potential changes and plan accordingly to optimise your position.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can You Prepare?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With potential changes on the horizon, it’s essential to be proactive. Here’s how we can help:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review Your Finances:</strong> We can work with you to review your current financial and tax situation, ensuring you are in the best possible position to adapt to any changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> By keeping informed about the potential changes, we can help you develop a strategic plan, whether you’re an individual, a small business owner, or an investor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> Our team will continue to monitor the Budget announcements and keep you updated on any changes that may impact your finances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get In Touch today!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay Ahead – Stay Informed with Black &amp; White Accounting!</strong></p>\n",

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we believe that accountants are more than just number crunchers who appear once a year to sort out your tax return. If you only think of your accountant during tax season, you’re missing out on <strong>huge financial opportunities</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re busting the myth that accountants are only useful when your tax deadline looms. The truth? A great accountant is your <strong>year-round business partner</strong>, helping you make smarter financial decisions, maximise profits, and keep your business on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “I Only Need an Accountant for Tax Returns”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many business owners see accountants as tax specialists who step in once a year to file returns, minimise tax liabilities, and make sure they’re compliant with HMRC. While that’s certainly an important part of what we do, it’s <strong>just the tip of the iceberg.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only reach out to your accountant when it’s time to submit tax returns, you’re <strong>missing out on expert advice</strong> that could be helping your business grow, save money, and stay financially secure throughout the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Accountants Offer Year-Round Financial Strategy &amp; Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A forward-thinking accountant doesn’t just <em>react</em> to tax deadlines—we <em>proactively</em> help you plan, strategise, and optimise your finances <strong>all year round</strong>. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Cash Flow Management &amp; Budgeting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running out of cash is one of the biggest reasons businesses fail. We help you monitor and forecast your cash flow, ensuring you have the funds to keep growing without financial stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tax Planning (Not Just Tax Filing!)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why wait until the last minute to think about tax? Year-round tax planning ensures you <strong>minimise liabilities</strong>, maximise allowances, and take advantage of every tax break available <strong>before</strong> deadlines approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Financial Growth &amp; Business Strategy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about expanding, hiring, or investing in new equipment? We help you make informed financial decisions that align with your long-term goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Avoiding Penalties &amp; Staying Compliant</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missed VAT deadlines? Forgotten PAYE obligations? A good accountant keeps you ahead of compliance requirements <strong>before</strong> HMRC starts knocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Helping You Secure Funding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need business loans or investment, we prepare financial reports and forecasts that banks and investors take seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Optimising Payroll &amp; Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From managing payroll to structuring employee benefits efficiently, we ensure you’re operating in the most tax-efficient way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Navigating Business Challenges</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facing an HMRC audit? Struggling with late payments from clients? Unexpected economic downturn? A trusted accountant helps you navigate financial obstacles <strong>before they become crises.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: A Year-Round Accountant Saves You Time, Money &amp; Stress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The businesses that thrive aren’t the ones that scramble at tax season—they’re the ones that take a <strong>proactive</strong> approach to financial management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we work with clients <strong>all year round</strong>, ensuring they’re always ahead of the game—whether it’s tax efficiency, business growth, or financial planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re only using your accountant at tax season, you’re <strong>not getting the full value</strong> of what we can do.

As your trusted accountants who guide startups, fast-growing companies, and mature businesses through their financial journeys, we’re here to break it all down for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a B-Corp?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A B-Corporation, or B-Corp, is a certification awarded to businesses that meet high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Think of it as the business world’s equivalent of being a “force for good.” It’s for companies that want to balance purpose and profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional corporations that often focus solely on shareholder returns, B-Corps aim to benefit all stakeholders—employees, customers, communities, and the planet. Certified by the nonprofit B Lab, companies must undergo a rigorous assessment of their operations to earn the B-Corp badge. Does this sound like you?

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we stay ahead of financial trends so you don’t get caught out—and today, we’re tackling one of the biggest misconceptions in the world of digital finance: <em>“Crypto gains are tax-free.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With cryptocurrency and digital assets becoming mainstream, many investors assume that profits made from trading, staking, or even mining are outside of HMRC’s reach. <strong>The reality? HMRC is cracking down on undeclared crypto gains, and failing to report them could lead to significant penalties.</strong> Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “HMRC Doesn’t Tax Crypto Gains”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency has long been viewed as a financial “wild west,” leading some investors to believe that gains made from Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, or staking rewards <strong>aren’t taxable.</strong> Many assume that because crypto operates outside traditional banking systems, HMRC has no visibility on these transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wrong!</strong> HMRC considers cryptocurrency a <strong>taxable asset</strong>, just like stocks, property, or foreign exchange profits. If you’ve been cashing in on crypto but failing to declare your gains, you could be facing an unexpected tax bill—and even an investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Crypto Gains &amp; Income Are Taxable in the UK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC views cryptocurrency as a financial asset, meaning any profit made from it is <strong>subject to tax</strong> under Capital Gains Tax (CGT) or Income Tax, depending on how the assets were acquired and used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on Crypto</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <strong>buy and sell crypto as an investment</strong>, your profits will likely be subject to <strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>. This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Selling crypto for GBP or another currency</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Swapping one crypto asset for another (e.g., Bitcoin for Ethereum)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using crypto to pay for goods or services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gifting crypto (outside of a spouse or civil partner)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gains above the CGT threshold are taxed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Losses can be <strong>offset against other capital gains</strong> to reduce your tax bill.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Income Tax on Crypto Earnings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <strong>earn crypto rather than invest in it</strong>, it may be subject to <strong>Income Tax and National Insurance</strong>. This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mining rewards</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staking rewards</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Airdrops</strong> (free crypto distributions, unless received as a gift)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Crypto payments for work or services</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Crypto income is taxed <strong>at your normal income tax rate</strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you receive crypto as payment for services, you must report it as <strong>self-employment income</strong> and register for Self-Assessment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC’s Crackdown on Crypto Tax Avoidance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC has ramped up efforts to track crypto transactions, working with exchanges and financial institutions to <strong>identify undeclared crypto gains.</strong> This means:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are sharing data with HMRC.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unreported crypto gains could result in tax investigations and penalties.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Failure to disclose crypto earnings could lead to fines or even legal action.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens If You Don’t Declare Crypto Gains?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Penalties &amp; Fines</strong> – HMRC can issue fines and demand backdated tax on undeclared gains. ❌ <strong>Interest Charges</strong> – Late tax payments will accrue interest, increasing the amount owed. ❌ <strong>Tax Investigations</strong> – HMRC has the power to investigate bank accounts and trading activity. ❌ <strong>Severe Consequences for Tax Evasion</strong> – In extreme cases, failure to report large crypto gains could lead to legal action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Stay HMRC-Compliant with Crypto</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The good news?</strong> Paying tax on crypto doesn’t have to be complicated—especially if you plan ahead and track your transactions properly. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Keep Detailed Records</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate gains and losses accurately, you need a clear record of: ✅ Dates of transactions ✅ Amounts in GBP at the time of each transaction ✅ Crypto-to-crypto swaps ✅ Any fees paid ✅ Gains and losses on disposals</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Use Crypto Tax Software</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tools like <strong>CoinTracker, Koinly, and CryptoTaxCalculator</strong> can help track transactions and generate tax reports, making it easier to stay compliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Report Crypto Gains on Your Tax Return</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve made taxable gains or earnings, you must declare them via <strong>Self-Assessment</strong> or through your <strong>Capital Gains Tax Report.</strong> The deadline for filing is <strong>31st January</strong> following the tax year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Claim Losses to Reduce Your Tax Bill</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve had crypto losses, <strong>you can offset them against future gains</strong>—but they must be formally reported to HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Work with a Crypto-Savvy Accountant</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto tax can be complex, but at <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping investors, traders, and businesses navigate crypto tax rules and <strong>maximise tax efficiency.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Let This Myth Cost You – Get Crypto Tax Advice Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency isn’t a tax-free loophole—it’s a taxable asset, and <strong>HMRC is cracking down on those who fail to declare their gains.</strong> If you’ve been trading, staking, or earning crypto, now is the time to get your tax affairs in order <strong>before HMRC comes knocking.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help crypto investors stay compliant while making the most of legitimate tax-saving strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not sure if you owe tax on your crypto?

      "content": "\n<p>With the rise of home working (especially during and after COVID), many UK business owners, freelancers, and remote workers are eyeing up their garden as the perfect spot for a dedicated home office. But the big question is: Can you put your garden office through your business and claim it as a business expense? This is a question we get asked all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer? Yes… but there are important details to be aware of! In this blog, we’ll explore how you can make the most of your garden office, what you can claim, and the potential tax implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is a Garden Office a Business Expense?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can claim the cost of a garden office as a legitimate business expense, but there are strict rules from HMRC regarding what is allowable. The key factor here is whether your garden office is used solely for business purposes. If it is, you may be able to claim for some of the costs. But if you use the space for personal purposes too—such as a home gym, guest room, or hobby space—your claim will be restricted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Can You Claim?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to putting your garden office through your business, here’s a breakdown of what you can potentially claim:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>1. Construction Costs</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot claim the full cost of constructing the garden office itself. HMRC views this as a capital expense rather than an allowable deduction against profits. However, you may be able to claim capital allowances on certain elements, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Electrical wiring;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lighting;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office furniture; and/or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thermal insulation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These items fall under ‘plant and machinery’ and may qualify for the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA), which could allow you to deduct the full cost up to the AIA limit in the year of purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>2. Utilities and Running Costs</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your garden office is up and running, you can claim for a proportion of the utilities, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Heating and lighting bills (as long as these are exclusively for your office); and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internet and phone bills, provided these are for business use.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to keep detailed records of the office’s running costs and ensure that you can prove to HMRC that the expenses are exclusively for business purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>3. Office Equipment</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Items like a desk, chair, computers, and printers that you need to run your business are fully claimable as business expenses. This can be a huge benefit when setting up your office, as high-quality equipment can be written off against your taxable profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What About Capital Gains Tax?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where it gets tricky. Claiming your garden office as a business asset could have capital gains tax (CGT) implications when you sell your home. Typically, when you sell your main residence, you benefit from Private Residence Relief (PRR), which exempts you from paying CGT on any increase in value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’ve claimed part of your home—such as a garden office—as a business expense, this could reduce your PRR. In other words, you might have to pay CGT on part of the profit made when you sell your home, based on the percentage of the property used for business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VAT Considerations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is VAT-registered, you might be tempted to reclaim VAT on the construction and furnishing costs of the garden office. However, HMRC will be strict on this front, and any personal use of the office may limit your ability to reclaim VAT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For VAT on materials and construction costs, reclaiming is allowed only for the portion used exclusively for business. If you’re using the garden office for personal reasons, VAT cannot be claimed in full.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can reclaim VAT on office furniture and equipment used solely for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could You Rent the Space to Your Business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to manage the expenses of a garden office is to rent the space to your business. If you’re a limited company director, you can set up a rental agreement between yourself and your company, charging the business for the use of the office. However, this needs to be done at market rate and should be formalised in a contract. Additionally, you’ll need to declare the rental income on your personal tax return, though you may offset this with expenses incurred in maintaining the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How We Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding whether to claim your garden office through your business involves a careful balancing act. Claiming construction costs and utilities can provide tax relief, but you must weigh this against potential capital gains tax and VAT complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great example of where we can help individuals and businesses make the right decision, to minimise the tax they pay, whilst factoring in any consequences which might result (intended or unintended). For example, we can help you with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Calculating what costs you can claim for your garden office;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoiding potential pitfalls like capital gains tax charges;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structuring your business to get the most out of your office space; and/or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Advising on VAT and other tax considerations</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re thinking about setting up a garden office and want to know more about what’s possible, get in touch with us today. We’ll help you find the most tax-efficient way to make your garden office work for your business!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>As tax efficiency and wealth preservation become top priorities for many families, the <strong>Family Investment Company (FIC)</strong> has emerged as a powerful tool to manage and pass on wealth. But is it the right choice for you? Whether you’re a high-net-worth individual or looking for a way to protect your family’s assets, a FIC could offer a compelling alternative to traditional trust structures or personal investments. In this blog, we’ll dive into the ins and outs of Family Investment Companies and help you decide if it’s the right strategy for your financial goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Family Investment Company (FIC)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Family Investment Company</strong> is a private limited company set up to hold and manage family wealth. The main purpose of a FIC is to allow wealth to grow within a tax-efficient corporate environment, where family members are the shareholders. It can invest in a variety of assets, such as property, shares, or investment funds, while also offering more control and flexibility over how wealth is passed down to future generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is typically structured to ensure the founders (often parents or grandparents) retain control while future generations (such as children or grandchildren) benefit from the assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does a FIC Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a FIC involves establishing a limited company and transferring assets (often cash) into the company. The founders usually subscribe for <strong>different classes of shares</strong>, giving them control over voting rights, dividend distributions, and asset allocation. Family members can hold shares with limited or no voting rights, ensuring wealth is passed down without ceding control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Flexibility in Control</strong>: You can decide who holds voting rights and who benefits from dividends.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-Efficient Growth</strong>: Investments made by the FIC grow in a tax-efficient corporate environment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wealth Transfer</strong>: Provides a clear and structured way to transfer wealth to younger generations without handing over full control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros of a Family Investment Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax Efficiency</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One of the main attractions of a FIC is the potential to <strong>reduce inheritance tax (IHT)</strong> liabilities. By transferring assets to the FIC early on, growth on these assets is outside the founder’s estate for IHT purposes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax Rates</strong>: Investments held within a FIC are subject to corporation tax on gains and income (currently 25%), which is often lower than personal tax rates on income and capital gains.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividends</strong>: Shareholders can receive dividends, which may benefit from lower personal tax rates, especially for family members in lower tax brackets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control &amp; Flexibility</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Founders can <strong>retain control</strong> through voting shares, while future generations hold non-voting shares. This means wealth can be transferred without giving away management power.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can set rules for how and when dividends are distributed to ensure younger generations don&#8217;t access large sums prematurely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protection from Family Disputes</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Shareholder agreements can be drawn up to avoid potential conflicts. Clear guidelines about share transfers, voting rights, and dividend policies can prevent family disagreements in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoiding Trust Complications</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>FICs can be an appealing alternative to family trusts, which have become less attractive due to changes in tax rules. FICs allow you to avoid the <strong>periodic and exit charges</strong> that apply to discretionary trusts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cons of a Family Investment Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complex Setup and Administration</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Setting up a FIC requires detailed planning, legal advice, and the creation of multiple classes of shares. <strong>Ongoing compliance</strong> with company law, annual filings, and accounting can add administrative burden.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Costs</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Professional fees for setting up a FIC can be significant, including legal, tax, and accounting costs. Additionally, <strong>annual running costs</strong> can add up, especially if the FIC holds diverse assets that require regular management.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax on Gains</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While the corporation tax rate may be lower than personal tax rates, <strong>capital gains realised within the FIC</strong> will be subject to corporation tax. Additionally, when dividends are distributed, family members will need to pay income tax.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Access to Funds</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Once assets are transferred to the FIC, they are no longer the personal property of the founder. While you can access dividends, accessing capital could trigger additional tax implications.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is a FIC Right for You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A FIC is particularly suited for high-net-worth individuals or families looking to pass on wealth in a structured and tax-efficient way. It’s a powerful tool for <strong>long-term wealth management</strong>, especially if you want to retain control while allowing your assets to grow within a corporate framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some scenarios where a FIC might be the right choice:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>You want to protect family wealth</strong>: If you’re concerned about future inheritance tax liabilities and want to protect wealth for future generations, a FIC could help reduce IHT exposure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You need flexibility and control</strong>: If you want to transfer wealth to your children or grandchildren but retain control over how and when they access it, a FIC’s share structure allows you to do this effectively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your investments are substantial</strong>: If you have a large investment portfolio or business assets, the corporate tax rates applied to capital gains and income within a FIC might offer more tax efficiency compared to holding them personally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have a smaller portfolio or don&#8217;t require significant control over the distribution of wealth, alternative options like <strong>trusts, ISAs, or even a personal investment portfolio</strong> might be simpler and potentially more cost-effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Family Investment Company</strong> can be a game-changer for families looking to safeguard and grow their wealth for future generations. With its potential for tax-efficient investment growth and the ability to retain control over family assets, it’s an attractive option for high-net-worth individuals. However, the complex setup and ongoing administration mean it’s not for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering a FIC or want to explore other tax-efficient strategies, reach out to our team for expert advice tailored to your family’s needs.</p>\n",

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we believe that <strong>staying informed means staying compliant</strong>, and today, we’re tackling a dangerous misconception: <em>“HMRC won’t check small businesses.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many small business owners assume that HMRC is only interested in large corporations and high-profile tax evasion cases. The reality? <strong>HMRC actively monitors businesses of all sizes</strong>—and small businesses are often the easiest targets for compliance checks. Here’s why you <strong>must</strong> take compliance seriously, no matter how big (or small) your business is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “Small Businesses Fly Under the Radar”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some business owners believe that because they’re a small operation, HMRC won’t bother investigating them. After all, why would the tax office waste time inspecting a sole trader, freelancer, or small limited company when there are multi-million-pound corporations to go after?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, HMRC is cracking down on small business compliance more than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: HMRC Investigates Businesses of All Sizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Small businesses are actually <strong>more likely</strong> to be investigated than larger corporations. Why? Because they often lack the resources to keep perfect records, making them easier targets for HMRC compliance checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How HMRC Identifies Small Businesses for Checks:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Random Spot Checks</strong> – HMRC conducts routine compliance checks on businesses <strong>of all sizes</strong>, including sole traders and startups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inconsistent Tax Returns</strong> – If your income fluctuates significantly, or your declared expenses seem unusually high, it could trigger an inquiry.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Late or Inaccurate Filings</strong> – Submitting tax returns or VAT filings late (or making errors) increases the likelihood of an investigation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tip-offs &amp; Red Flags</strong> – HMRC receives anonymous reports about businesses suspected of underreporting income or over-claiming expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Industry-Specific Targeting</strong> – Certain sectors, such as construction, hospitality, and e-commerce, are closely monitored for tax compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Risks of Non-Compliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Believing this myth can be <strong>costly</strong>. If HMRC investigates your business and finds issues, you could face:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fines &amp; Penalties</strong> – Incorrect tax filings can lead to hefty fines, interest charges, and backdated tax bills.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Scrutiny</strong> – Once HMRC has flagged you, future tax returns are more likely to be examined.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cash Flow Disruptions</strong> – A tax enquiry can lead to unexpected liabilities, impacting your ability to run your business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Legal Consequences</strong> – In extreme cases, persistent tax non-compliance can result in legal action.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Stay HMRC-Compliant and Enquiry-Ready</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being proactive about compliance <strong>protects your business</strong> from unexpected HMRC scrutiny. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Keep Accurate Financial Records</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintain <strong>clear, organised, and up-to-date</strong> records of all income, expenses, invoices, and receipts. This is especially crucial with <strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong> requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. File Tax Returns On Time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid unnecessary penalties by ensuring <strong>all tax returns, VAT filings, and payroll obligations</strong> are submitted before deadlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Be Honest About Expenses &amp; Income</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to overclaim expenses or underreport income may seem like a quick way to save money—but it’s a <strong>huge red flag</strong> for HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Use Accounting Software</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital tools like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, and Sage</strong> help track your finances accurately and ensure compliance with HMRC’s digital reporting standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Work with a Professional Accountant</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to stay ahead of HMRC compliance checks? <strong>Partner with an expert accountant.</strong> We help businesses like yours stay compliant, file accurate returns, and avoid costly mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Let This Myth Cost You – Stay Compliant with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC <em>does</em> check small businesses, and believing otherwise could put your business at risk. Compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines—it’s about protecting your business, maintaining financial stability, and ensuring future success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses <strong>of all sizes</strong> stay on top of tax regulations, file accurate returns, and avoid unwanted HMRC scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need expert guidance on compliance?

At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses <strong>stay compliant, tax-efficient, and financially secure</strong>—and today, we’re tackling a costly misconception: <em>“I don’t need to enrol employees in a pension if they don’t want one.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many employers assume that if an employee says they <strong>don’t want</strong> a pension, they can simply skip auto-enrolment. <strong>Wrong!</strong> Failing to comply with workplace pension rules can result in <strong>heavy fines and legal trouble</strong>. Let’s set the record straight and ensure you don’t fall into the auto-enrolment trap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “Employees Can Choose Whether They Want a Pension”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some employers believe they only need to enrol employees in a workplace pension <strong>if they ask for one</strong>. Others think that if an employee <strong>says they don’t want a pension</strong>, they can simply opt out and be left alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The reality? It’s not up to the employee—or the employer.</strong> The UK’s <strong>auto-enrolment</strong> rules mean that <strong>eligible employees must be automatically enrolled</strong> by law, whether they like it or not. If they want to opt out, they must do so <strong>through the correct process</strong>, and <strong>you cannot influence their decision</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Auto-Enrolment is a Legal Requirement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2012, UK businesses have been legally required to <strong>automatically enrol eligible employees into a workplace pension scheme</strong>. This means:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Employers <strong>must</strong> enrol employees earning <strong>£10,000+ per year</strong> and aged <strong>22+</strong> into a pension.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Employers <strong>must</strong> contribute at least <strong>3%</strong> of an employee’s qualifying earnings, while employees contribute <strong>5%</strong> (for a total of <strong>8%</strong> minimum contributions).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Employees <strong>can</strong> opt out—but <strong>only after being enrolled</strong>, and they must do this directly through the pension provider.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Employers <strong>cannot</strong> encourage or pressure employees to opt out—this is known as <strong>inducement</strong> and is <strong>illegal</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Risks of Ignoring Auto-Enrolment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t follow the pension rules correctly, <strong>The Pensions Regulator (TPR) will catch up with you</strong>. Here’s what can happen if you ignore auto-enrolment:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Fines &amp; Penalties</strong> – Failure to comply can result in fines starting at <strong>£400</strong>, with <strong>daily penalties of up to £10,000</strong> for ongoing non-compliance. ❌ <strong>Backdated Pension Contributions</strong> – You’ll have to pay <strong>all missed contributions</strong>, including those for employees who should have been enrolled months or years ago. ❌ <strong>Legal Action</strong> – Repeated failure to comply could result in further enforcement action and damage to your business’s reputation. ❌ <strong>Employee Complaints &amp; Investigations</strong> – If an employee complains to The Pensions Regulator, your business could face a <strong>formal investigation.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Stay Compliant with Auto-Enrolment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? Auto-enrolment doesn’t have to be complicated—<strong>as long as you set things up correctly</strong>. Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Assess Your Employees</strong> – Check who qualifies for auto-enrolment based on their <strong>age</strong> and <strong>earnings</strong>. ✅ <strong>Choose a Pension Scheme</strong> – You must use a compliant workplace pension scheme such as <strong>NEST, The People’s Pension, or a private provider</strong>. ✅ <strong>Automatically Enrol Employees</strong> – Don’t wait for employees to ask; you must <strong>enrol them automatically</strong> if they’re eligible. ✅ <strong>Manage Opt-Outs Legally</strong> – Employees <strong>must opt out themselves</strong> (you can’t do it for them!), and you must re-enrol them <strong>every three years</strong>. ✅ <strong>Keep Accurate Records</strong> – Maintain records of enrolments, opt-outs, and contributions for at least <strong>six years</strong>. ✅ <strong>Submit Your Declarations on Time</strong> – You must <strong>declare your compliance</strong> with The Pensions Regulator when required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Auto-Enrolment is NOT Optional</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking you don’t need to enrol employees in a pension <strong>because they don’t want one</strong> is a <strong>costly mistake</strong>. <strong>Auto-enrolment is the law, and employers must comply—no exceptions!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get Expert Pension Compliance Support Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses navigate auto-enrolment, ensuring full compliance while keeping payroll smooth and stress-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need help setting up a workplace pension scheme?

At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we believe that <strong>smart tax planning can be a game-changer</strong>—and today, we’re tackling a myth that many small businesses fall for: <em>“I don’t need to register for VAT until I’m over the threshold.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s <strong>true</strong> that VAT registration only becomes <strong>mandatory</strong> once your taxable turnover exceeds <strong>£90,000 (from 1 April 2024)</strong>, waiting until you hit the threshold <strong>could be a missed opportunity</strong>. Let’s uncover the <em>voluntary VAT secret</em> and why registering early could actually benefit your business!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “I’ll Only Register for VAT When I Have To”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many small businesses assume that <strong>avoiding VAT registration for as long as possible</strong> is the best strategy. After all, if you’re not VAT-registered, you don’t have to charge VAT on sales, making your prices <strong>seem lower and more attractive</strong>, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the catch: <strong>VAT isn’t just a burden—it can be a powerful tool</strong> that helps businesses reclaim VAT on expenses, improve credibility, and even boost cash flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Voluntary VAT Registration Can Be a Smart Move</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your turnover is below the <strong>£90,000</strong> threshold, <strong>registering for VAT voluntarily</strong> could give you a financial and competitive edge. Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Claim Back VAT on Business Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business <strong>incurs VAT on purchases</strong>, registering voluntarily means you can <strong>reclaim VAT</strong> on things like: ✅ Equipment &amp; office supplies ✅ Professional services (accounting, marketing, legal advice) ✅ Business travel &amp; fuel costs ✅ Software &amp; subscriptions ✅ Stock &amp; raw materials</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses with <strong>high start-up costs</strong>, registering for VAT could mean <strong>significant savings</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Boost Business Credibility</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being VAT-registered can make your business look <strong>more established and trustworthy</strong>, particularly if you deal with B2B clients. Larger businesses may prefer working with VAT-registered suppliers, assuming they are more <strong>professional and financially stable.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Avoid the VAT Threshold Trap</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your turnover is close to the <strong>£90,000 threshold</strong>, waiting until you are <em>forced</em> to register can cause cash flow problems. Suddenly having to add 20% VAT to your prices could lead to <strong>lost customers or reduced margins.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By registering early, you can <strong>gradually adjust your pricing strategy</strong> and avoid a sudden, disruptive change when VAT registration becomes mandatory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Take Advantage of the Flat Rate Scheme</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller businesses with <strong>turnover under £150,000</strong> can <strong>opt for the VAT Flat Rate Scheme</strong>, where you pay a <strong>fixed percentage</strong> of your turnover instead of reclaiming VAT on purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some businesses, this can <strong>simplify accounting</strong> and even lead to paying less VAT overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Work With More VAT-Registered Clients</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you mainly <strong>work with VAT-registered businesses</strong>, they can <strong>reclaim the VAT you charge</strong>, meaning your prices remain competitive. This removes the fear of “pricing yourself out” of the market due to VAT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Not to Register for VAT Early</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While voluntary VAT registration has advantages, it’s not the right move for everyone. <strong>You may want to hold off if:</strong> ❌ Your clients are mostly individual consumers (who can’t reclaim VAT, making your prices appear higher) ❌ You have very few VATable expenses to reclaim ❌ You’re a brand-new business still testing your market viability</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: VAT Can Be an Asset, Not a Burden</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re hovering below the <strong>£90,000 threshold</strong>, don’t just assume that delaying VAT registration is the best choice. <strong>For many businesses, voluntary VAT registration can provide financial benefits, tax savings, and enhanced credibility.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let’s Make VAT Work for You!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT doesn’t have to be a headache—it can be <strong>a powerful tool to boost your business’s bottom line.</strong> At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses like yours determine the <strong>best VAT strategy</strong>, whether it’s <strong>registering early, reclaiming expenses, or managing cash flow efficiently.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not sure if voluntary VAT registration is right for you?

They offer bespoke services tailored to the unique needs of each family, ensuring both privacy and precision in every decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family offices come in two main forms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Single-Family Offices (SFOs):</strong> Dedicated to serving one family, providing unrivalled focus and control.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-Family Offices (MFOs):</strong> Offering similar services but catering to multiple families, often at a lower cost while still delivering exceptional expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Family Offices Growing in Popularity in the UK?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, the UK has seen a surge in demand for family offices, driven by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Generational Wealth Transfer:</strong> With trillions of pounds set to be passed to the next generation over the coming decades, families are seeking structured solutions to ensure their wealth endures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Complexity:</strong> Managing modern wealth isn’t just about investments.

At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses stay <strong>compliant, tax-efficient, and financially secure</strong>—and today, we’re tackling a payroll myth that many employers fall for: <em>“Paying employees in cash is fine as long as I record it.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses, particularly in industries like hospitality, construction, and retail, assume that paying staff in cash is <strong>completely acceptable</strong> as long as they log the payments somewhere. But <strong>HMRC takes a much stricter view</strong>, and if you don’t follow the rules, you could face penalties, investigations, and even legal action. Let’s set the record straight!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “Cash Payments Are Fine if I Write Them Down”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some employers believe that as long as they keep a <strong>manual record</strong> of cash wages, they don’t need to worry about payroll compliance. Others assume that cash wages don’t need to be taxed in the same way as bank transfers. <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how you pay your employees, <strong>all wages are subject to PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs), and other payroll obligations.</strong> Paying in cash doesn’t exempt you from these responsibilities!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Paying Employees in Cash Still Requires Full Payroll Compliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you <em>can</em> pay employees in cash—but only if you follow <strong>all</strong> the legal payroll processes. Here’s what you <strong>must</strong> do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Operate PAYE and Deduct Taxes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if wages are paid in cash, you <strong>must still deduct</strong>: ✅ Income Tax ✅ Employee National Insurance Contributions (NICs) ✅ Employer NICs ✅ Student Loan Repayments (if applicable) ✅ Workplace Pension Contributions (if applicable)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <strong>must</strong> submit this information to HMRC via Real Time Information (RTI), just as you would with bank transfer payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Provide Payslips</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees <strong>must</strong> receive a payslip showing their gross pay, deductions, and net pay—regardless of whether they’re paid in cash or via bank transfer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Ensure Minimum Wage Compliance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re paying cash wages, HMRC will be <strong>extra vigilant</strong> in checking that you’re meeting the <strong>National Minimum Wage (NMW) or National Living Wage (NLW)</strong> rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Keep Accurate Payroll Records</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <strong>must</strong> keep payroll records for at least <strong>3 years</strong>. If HMRC finds that you haven’t recorded cash payments correctly, they may assume you’ve been avoiding tax—even if you’ve paid employees fairly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Declare Cash Payments to HMRC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply “writing down” cash payments in a notebook <strong>isn’t enough</strong>. All wages must be processed through your payroll system, reported to HMRC, and reflected in tax filings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Risks of Getting It Wrong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fail to properly report cash payments, <strong>HMRC will see it as tax evasion.</strong> This can lead to: ❌ <strong>Fines &amp; Penalties</strong> – HMRC can impose penalties of up to <strong>100% of unpaid tax</strong> plus interest. ❌ <strong>Backdated Tax Bills</strong> – If you haven’t deducted PAYE or NICs correctly, you’ll have to pay the missing amounts—potentially <strong>years’ worth</strong> of unpaid tax. ❌ <strong>HMRC Investigations</strong> – If HMRC suspects payroll fraud, they may launch a full tax investigation, scrutinising <strong>all</strong> your business finances. ❌ <strong>Legal Consequences</strong> – In serious cases, deliberate tax evasion <strong>can lead to criminal prosecution.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Pay Employees the Right Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still want to pay employees in cash while staying compliant, follow these <strong>best practices</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Use Payroll Software</strong> – Systems like Xero, QuickBooks, and Sage ensure correct tax deductions and automatic RTI reporting to HMRC. ✅ <strong>Get Payslips Right</strong> – Always issue legally compliant payslips showing deductions. ✅ <strong>Keep Proper Payroll Records</strong> – Store payroll data securely for at least <strong>three years</strong>. ✅ <strong>Work with an Accountant</strong> – A professional accountant ensures you remain compliant, avoid costly mistakes, and optimise payroll efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Cash Payments Must Follow Payroll Rules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Paying employees in cash <strong>isn’t illegal</strong>, but <strong>failing to report it correctly is.</strong> If you don’t follow <strong>HMRC’s strict payroll rules</strong>, you could face heavy fines and legal trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need Payroll Help? We’ve Got You Covered!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make payroll <strong>stress-free and fully compliant.</strong> Whether you pay employees via bank transfer or cash, we ensure <strong>everything is properly reported, tax-efficient, and HMRC-approved.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need expert payroll advice?

      "content": "\n<p>Cryptocurrency has opened up exciting new avenues for investors and businesses alike. Whether you’re deep into DeFi or just dipping your toes into Bitcoin, understanding the tax implications of selling crypto in the UK can be your key to keeping more of those hard-earned gains. As specialists in crypto accounting, we&#8217;re here to guide you through the most tax-efficient ways to sell your digital assets, ensuring you stay compliant while maximising your returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Know Your Tax-Free Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest but often overlooked strategies is making the most of your <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) allowance</strong>. In the UK, the annual CGT allowance for the 2023/2024 tax year is £6,000 (2024/2024: £3,000). If your gains from selling crypto stay within this threshold, you won’t pay a penny in CGT. But here’s the trick—<strong>you can spread your disposals</strong> over different tax years to fully take advantage of this allowance every year. Strategic planning around when you sell can significantly reduce your overall tax burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Use Losses to Your Advantage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto’s notorious volatility can be frustrating, but from a tax perspective, it can work in your favour. If you sell crypto at a loss, that loss can be offset against any gains from other assets or even carried forward to reduce your tax bill in future years. If you had <strong>losses from previous years</strong> but forgot to declare them, don’t worry! You can still report them within four years, meaning future profits could be taxed less.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Gifting Crypto Between Spouses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A little-known but powerful tax hack is gifting crypto to your spouse or civil partner (no gain no loss basis). This transfer is <strong>tax-free</strong> and can allow you to <strong>double your household’s annual CGT allowance</strong>, making it an incredibly effective tool for families who invest together. Your spouse or partner can sell the gifted crypto under their own tax-free threshold, reducing your tax exposure as a unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Stagger Your Sales</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re sitting on a large crypto portfolio, don’t be in a rush to cash out all at once! By staggering your sales across tax years or by selling only small portions at a time, you can gradually sell without crossing into higher tax brackets or triggering a big CGT bill in one go. This is especially important if your disposals are pushing you close to the <strong>higher rate CGT threshold</strong>, which could see your tax rise from 10% to 20%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Consider Tax Implications of Crypto-to-Crypto Trades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many investors don&#8217;t realise that exchanging one cryptocurrency for another (for example, trading Bitcoin for Ethereum) is considered a <strong>taxable event</strong>. Each trade is viewed as a disposal for CGT purposes, even if you don’t convert it to GBP. To avoid unnecessary CGT hits, plan your crypto-to-crypto trades with care. If you&#8217;re looking to rebalance your portfolio, keep in mind that holding off on certain exchanges until the timing aligns with your tax strategy can save you big.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Move to a More Favourable Tax Jurisdiction (Temporarily or Permanently)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the adventurous, relocating to a country with more favourable crypto tax laws could be a game-changer. While this isn’t feasible for everyone, moving abroad, even temporarily, could save you a significant amount in tax. Just be sure you understand <strong>UK tax residency rules</strong>—if HMRC still considers you a UK resident, your overseas gains might still be taxable. Careful planning and a good tax advisor are essential here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Take Advantage of Your Personal Income Allowance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a low income, or your income from other sources is below the personal allowance threshold (£12,570 for 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 tax years), you can use that allowance against your crypto gains. This is particularly useful if you’re retired, working part-time, or using crypto as a side hustle. You may end up paying little to no tax on your crypto sales!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your partner has capacity within their personal allowance threshold, why not transfer the crypto to them for them to dispose of first?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Incorporate Your Crypto Trading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For regular traders or those running crypto businesses, incorporating and operating through a <strong>limited company</strong> might make sense. Some companies pay <strong>corporation tax</strong> at 19%, which is often lower than the personal CGT rates, especially for higher earners. While company structures come with their own complexities, this route can offer tax deferral options and more flexibility in how you extract profits. Do check though what legal name the currency is in; for it to be owned by the limited company, it needs to be in the limited company name.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Inheritance Tax: Plan Ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As your crypto portfolio grows, consider its impact on your inheritance tax (IHT) liabilities. In the UK, crypto is subject to IHT, just like other assets. However, there are ways to mitigate this, such as gifting crypto during your lifetime or setting up a trust. Additionally, if certain crypto investments qualify for <strong>Business Relief</strong>, you might be able to reduce or even eliminate IHT on these assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Don’t Forget to Track Everything</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC’s stance on crypto is becoming stricter, and with advancements in blockchain tracking technology, they are more capable of tracing crypto activity than ever before. This means <strong>record-keeping is critical</strong>. You need to document every transaction—whether it’s a sale, trade, or gift—along with the date, value in GBP, and any associated fees. This meticulous tracking will help ensure you claim the correct tax reliefs and avoid penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Get Professional Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cryptocurrency tax landscape is evolving, and as the space grows, so does HMRC’s scrutiny. Selling crypto tax-efficiently requires more than just knowing the rules—it’s about strategic planning and execution. Working with a specialist crypto accountant, like us, ensures you stay on the right side of the law while making the most of your investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to sell your crypto the tax-smart way?

      "content": "\n<p>Becoming a <strong>director of a limited company</strong> is a huge milestone, and if you’re reading this, congratulations! But let’s be honest—whether it’s your first time or your fifth, stepping into the director’s chair can bring a wave of mixed emotions. Should you be excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, or worried about the responsibilities that come with the title?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we know that taking on the role of a director is a big deal, and it’s normal to feel both thrilled and nervous. So, let’s break down what you can expect and help you determine whether you should be excited or scared—spoiler alert: it’s mostly excitement, but there are a few things to keep in mind!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Excitement: Why Being a Director is an Incredible Opportunity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. You’re in Control</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of being a company director is that you’re at the helm of the ship. <strong>You call the shots</strong>. Whether it’s shaping the company’s strategy, steering it towards growth, or building a dynamic team, you get to make decisions that impact the business’s future. The possibilities are endless, and it’s your vision that sets the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Unlimited Growth Potential</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director, you’re in a unique position to <strong>grow the business</strong> and expand into new markets. You can innovate, explore new revenue streams, and lead the company in exciting directions. The ability to scale your business and turn your goals into reality is a huge motivator, and seeing the direct results of your efforts is incredibly rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Building a Legacy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a company director is about more than just managing the day-to-day. It’s about <strong>building something lasting</strong>—a business that could potentially outlive you, provide for your family, and even create jobs and opportunities for others. That sense of legacy and accomplishment is one of the biggest drivers for entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Financial Reward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the increased responsibility of being a director comes the potential for significant <strong>financial rewards</strong>. As a director of a limited company, you have more flexibility with your income, whether through dividends, salary, or other benefits. If the business thrives, so does your financial position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Shaping the Culture</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director, you have the power to create the kind of work culture that you’ve always envisioned. Whether it’s a commitment to innovation, a focus on work-life balance, or a drive for excellence, you set the tone. This can make the company a place where both you and your employees love to work, which can also translate into better productivity and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Challenges: Should You Be Scared?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are plenty of reasons to be excited, it’s important to be aware of the <strong>responsibilities and risks</strong> that come with being a director. Here’s what you need to watch out for:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Legal Responsibilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director of a limited company, you are <strong>legally responsible</strong> for making sure the business complies with UK laws, including filing annual accounts, paying taxes, and ensuring good corporate governance. If the company runs into trouble, such as becoming insolvent, you could face personal consequences if you don’t follow the correct procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some key legal duties include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Filing accurate accounts</strong> with Companies House and HMRC.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensuring that the company operates in the best interests of its shareholders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoiding any <strong>conflicts of interest</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeping proper financial records and ensuring that the company pays its taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to meet these obligations could lead to fines or, in extreme cases, disqualification from acting as a director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Financial Risk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While your limited company status does <strong>protect your personal assets</strong> to some extent, you’re still financially responsible for the company’s actions. If the company struggles, you may have to make tough decisions, including securing additional funding or cutting costs. And if the company becomes insolvent, you could be held personally liable for its debts if wrongful trading is proven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Accountability</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a director, you’re accountable not only to the business but to its shareholders, employees, and customers. Your decisions can impact a wide range of stakeholders, and <strong>balancing their interests</strong> can sometimes be challenging. You’ll need to ensure that you’re acting in the company’s best interests at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Time and Stress</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a company can be time-consuming, especially in the early stages or during periods of rapid growth. As a director, the <strong>responsibility of leadership</strong> can sometimes feel heavy, and managing cash flow, employees, and operations might lead to stress. However, with the right team and systems in place, you can navigate these pressures effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Stay Excited and Minimise the Fear</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips to help you stay on the exciting side of being a director while managing the challenges:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Surround Yourself with Experts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to do it all alone. Surround yourself with a <strong>strong team</strong> of experts, from accountants and lawyers to operational managers.

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know the gig economy is booming, with more people than ever juggling side hustles alongside their main jobs. But do you really need to tell HMRC about that extra income?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re tackling a dangerous misconception: <em>“Side hustles don’t need to be declared.”</em> If you’re earning extra cash through freelancing, e-commerce, or gig work, assuming HMRC won’t notice could lead to <strong>costly penalties and tax trouble</strong>. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “HMRC Doesn’t Care About My Side Hustle”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people believe that small-scale side hustles fly under HMRC’s radar, especially if earnings aren’t huge or it’s “just a bit of extra cash.” After all, if it’s not a full-time job, why would it matter?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Most Side Hustles Are Taxable</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how informal your side gig is, <strong>income is still income</strong>—and HMRC expects you to report it. Whether you’re selling handmade crafts on Etsy, running a dropshipping business, doing freelance design work, or driving for Uber, <strong>if you’re making money, you may owe tax on it.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Do You Need to Declare Side Hustle Income?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you earn <strong>over £1,000 per year</strong> from your side hustle, you <strong>must</strong> declare it to HMRC.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>£1,000 Trading Allowance</strong> allows you to earn up to this amount tax-free, but anything above this must be reported through <strong>Self-Assessment.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re also employed, your employer <strong>does not</strong> report your side hustle income—<strong>you must do this yourself.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Counts as a Side Hustle?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any extra income outside of your main job could count as a taxable side hustle, including: ✅ Freelancing (writing, graphic design, consulting, etc.) ✅ Selling goods online (Etsy, eBay, Depop, Shopify) ✅ Driving for ride-share services (Uber, Bolt, etc.) ✅ Delivering food or goods (Deliveroo, Amazon Flex) ✅ Renting out property or rooms (Airbnb, holiday lets) ✅ Offering paid skills or services (coaching, tutoring, photography, etc.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens If You Don’t Declare Side Income?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring this myth can lead to serious consequences: ❌ <strong>Tax Penalties</strong> – HMRC can charge penalties, interest, and backdated tax for undeclared income. ❌ <strong>Investigations</strong> – If HMRC discovers undeclared income, they can launch an investigation into your finances. ❌ <strong>Fines &amp; Legal Action</strong> – In severe cases, persistent tax evasion could lead to legal action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Stay Tax-Compliant With Your Side Hustle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? <strong>Paying tax on your side hustle doesn’t have to be stressful!</strong> Here’s how to stay compliant while keeping your tax bill as low as possible:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Register for Self-Assessment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn over £1,000 from self-employment, you need to <strong>register with HMRC</strong> and file a Self-Assessment tax return each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Keep Track of Income &amp; Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use digital tools or apps to track all your earnings and expenses—this will make tax time much easier!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Claim Allowable Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <strong>offset business costs</strong> against your side hustle income, reducing your tax bill. Examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Website hosting and domain fees</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Equipment and software</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel costs (for work-related journeys)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Home office expenses</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Plan for Tax Payments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike PAYE employees, tax won’t automatically be deducted from your side hustle earnings. <strong>Set aside money</strong> for tax so you’re not caught off guard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Get Expert Accounting Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an accountant helps you stay compliant, <strong>maximize tax savings</strong>, and avoid costly mistakes. We can help you structure your side hustle tax-efficiently and ensure you’re not overpaying.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Let This Myth Cost You – Stay Compliant with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The gig economy offers incredible opportunities—but don’t let tax mistakes ruin your success. <strong>If you’re earning money from a side hustle, it’s time to get tax-savvy.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help freelancers, side hustlers, and small business owners navigate the tax system with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not sure if you need to declare your side income?

      "content": "\n<p>In the exciting world of business, partnerships can offer a wealth of opportunities. However, with these opportunities come challenges, and having a clear framework to navigate them is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we understand the nuances of business operations and are here to guide you through the importance of a <strong>partnership agreement</strong>. So, what exactly is a partnership agreement, why do you need one, and when is it necessary? Let’s explore!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Partnership?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, a partnership is defined as a relationship between two or more individuals or entities who collaborate to carry on a business with the intention of making a profit. This definition is outlined in the Partnership Act 1890, which establishes that partnerships can be formed through an oral agreement, written contract, or even through conduct. There are two key types of partnerships in the UK, general partnerships (no separate legal identity) and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP, introduced by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, which came into effect on 6 April 2001, which broadly are a hybrid of a general partnership and limited company, which do have separate legal identities).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Partnership Agreement?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A partnership agreement is a legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of a partnership between two or more individuals or entities. It serves as a roadmap for the relationship, defining each partner&#8217;s roles, responsibilities, and rights within the business. Key elements typically included in a partnership agreement are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Capital Contributions</strong>: How much each partner will contribute in terms of money, property, or expertise.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Profit and Loss Distribution</strong>: How profits and losses will be shared among the partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decision-Making Processes</strong>: Procedures for making business decisions, including voting rights and the process for resolving disputes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong>: Specific duties assigned to each partner, ensuring everyone knows their responsibilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Termination Clauses</strong>: Conditions under which the partnership may be dissolved and the procedures for doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, the Partnership Act 1890 does not require partners to have a formal written Shareholder Agreement; however, having one can significantly clarify the terms of the partnership and prevent misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is a Partnership Agreement Needed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Clarity and Structure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A partnership agreement provides clarity on each partner&#8217;s expectations and contributions. By detailing roles and responsibilities, it reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Protects Individual Interests</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a partnership, individual interests can sometimes conflict. A well-drafted agreement safeguards each partner’s rights and ensures their contributions are acknowledged and valued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partnerships can be prone to disagreements. Having a clear process for resolving disputes can save time, money, and relationships. An agreement can outline how conflicts should be addressed, whether through mediation, arbitration, or another method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Attracts Investors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering bringing in external investors, having a partnership agreement in place demonstrates that the business is well-organized and serious about its operations, which can enhance investor confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When is a Partnership Agreement Needed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s advisable for all partnerships to have an agreement in place, it becomes particularly crucial in the following situations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Starting a New Partnership</strong>: When forming a new business partnership, establishing an agreement from the outset can prevent future conflicts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Changes in Partnership Structure</strong>: If new partners are joining or existing partners are leaving, it’s essential to update or create a new agreement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Major Business Decisions</strong>: Before embarking on significant ventures, such as securing loans or entering into contracts, having a clear agreement can provide guidance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>: If disputes arise that could threaten the partnership, revisiting or creating an agreement can help clarify expectations and resolve issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Tips for Creating a Partnership Agreement</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consult Legal Experts</strong>: Engage a solicitor who specialises in partnership agreements to ensure your document complies with legal requirements and covers all necessary aspects (we’re happy to recommend someone here for you!).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be Comprehensive</strong>: Don’t overlook details. Address all key areas, including decision-making processes, profit-sharing, and roles, to prevent ambiguity later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review Regularly</strong>: As your partnership evolves, so should your agreement. Regularly review and update it to reflect changes in the business structure or operations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Communicate Openly</strong>: Ensure all partners are involved in the drafting process. Open communication fosters trust and ensures everyone is on the same page.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Include Exit Strategies</strong>: Outline procedures for when a partner wants to leave the business or if the partnership needs to be dissolved. This can help avoid messy separations in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A partnership agreement is not just a formality; it’s a vital document that can protect your business and strengthen your partnership. At Black and White Accounting, we believe that every partnership should be built on a foundation of clear communication and mutual respect. Whether you’re starting a new venture or seeking to formalise existing arrangements, having a partnership agreement is essential for your success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering creating or updating a partnership agreement, contact us today!

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we believe that knowledge is power—especially when it comes to tax matters. Today, we’re tackling a common misconception: that VAT is just an extra cost you have to bear. Spoiler alert—it doesn’t have to be!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding VAT: More Than Just an Extra Expense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many business owners see VAT as an unavoidable cost, eating into their hard-earned profits. But here’s the truth: if you’re VAT registered, VAT shouldn’t be a cost at all—it’s a transactional element that you can (and should) be reclaiming on eligible purchases. The key is understanding how to navigate the system efficiently and ensuring you’re claiming back every pound you’re entitled to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The VAT Reclaiming Process – Simpler Than You Think</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is VAT registered, you can reclaim VAT on most business-related expenses, provided you have the right documentation. But many businesses miss out on reclaiming VAT simply because they don’t know what qualifies or they fail to keep proper records.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here’s how to make sure you’re reclaiming all that you’re owed:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep Your Receipts &amp; Invoices</strong> – Ensure all business purchases come with VAT invoices that clearly state the VAT amount.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Know What’s Claimable</strong> – You can reclaim VAT on things like office supplies, professional services, and even some travel expenses, but you cannot reclaim VAT on client entertainment or personal expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit Timely Returns</strong> – Avoid penalties and cash flow issues by staying on top of your VAT return deadlines.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use Digital Tools</strong> – With Making Tax Digital (MTD) in full swing, using accounting software can streamline your VAT calculations and submissions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek Expert Guidance</strong> – An experienced accountant (like us!) can ensure you never leave VAT unclaimed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most diligent business owners can fall into VAT traps. Some common mistakes include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Not registering for VAT when you should</strong> – If your turnover exceeds £90,000 (as of 2024), you’re legally required to register.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Missing VAT reclaims on mixed-use purchases</strong> – If you use something for both business and personal use, you may still be able to reclaim a portion of the VAT.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overlooking foreign VAT reclaims</strong> – If you travel for business and pay VAT abroad, you might be able to reclaim it through the VAT refund scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maximise Your VAT Efficiency with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT doesn’t have to be a burden—it’s an opportunity to reclaim costs and boost your bottom line. At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses navigate VAT complexities with ease, ensuring you claim everything you’re entitled to while staying compliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to stop VAT from being an ‘extra cost’ and start seeing it as an opportunity for savings, get in touch with our expert team today.

      "content": "\n<p>Franchising is one of the most powerful ways to rapidly expand a successful business. It allows you to replicate your proven business model, extend your brand, and grow rapidly without needing to take on all the operational burdens yourself. But how do you know if your business is ready to be franchised, and what steps do you need to take to ensure success?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we support dynamic businesses across the UK, helping them understand when they’re ready to franchise and guiding them through the process. In this blog, we’ll explore when your business is ready to franchise, when it’s not, and provide you with a step-by-step guide to franchising your business successfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Your Business Ready to Franchise?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every business is ready to become a franchise, and rushing into franchising without a solid foundation can lead to costly mistakes. Before diving in, ask yourself these key questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Do You Have a Proven, Replicable Business Model?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchising relies on having a business model that can be easily replicated by others. If your success is tied to a unique location or a charismatic owner, it may be difficult for franchisees to recreate that success. A franchise-ready business has:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Documented processes</strong> that can be standardised across locations;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>track record of profitability</strong> that proves the model works;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The ability to <strong>train others</strong> to replicate your success; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sustainable business model that does not depend on a small number of individuals (i.e., can be replicated).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Is There Demand Beyond Your Current Location?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before franchising, you need to make sure there’s demand for your business outside your current area. Does your product or service appeal to customers in different regions or markets? Market research is key here—you’ll need to know that your concept works just as well in other places as it does in your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Can You Maintain Quality and Brand Consistency?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you scale your business through franchising, maintaining the same level of quality and brand consistency is crucial. You’ll need to have a plan in place to monitor franchisees and ensure they’re delivering the same customer experience you’re known for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Your Business May Not Be Ready to Franchise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While franchising can be a powerful way to grow, it’s not always the right choice for every business. Here are some signs that your business may not be ready:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>You’re still refining your business model</strong>: If your business is still in its early stages or you’re constantly tweaking your operations, it’s best to wait until you have a fully established and proven system.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You can’t easily replicate your success</strong>: If your success relies heavily on your personal involvement, it may be challenging to train others to achieve the same results.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You lack financial stability</strong>: Franchising requires upfront investment. If your cash flow is unstable, or you’re struggling with debts, franchising could put additional strain on your business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step-by-Step Guide to Franchising Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve determined that your business is ready to franchise, congratulations! Now, it’s time to plan out the franchising process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Refine Your Business Model</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first step is to ensure that every aspect of your business is documented and replicable. This means developing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Operations manuals</strong> that detail how every part of the business works, from customer service to inventory management;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Training programs</strong> to teach franchisees how to run their own locations successfully; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brand guidelines</strong> to ensure franchisees maintain a consistent look and feel in every location.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Seek Professional Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchising is a complex process, and it’s essential to have the right team supporting you. Consulting with professionals—including a franchise consultant, lawyer, and accountants —will help you navigate the legal, financial, and operational challenges of franchising. Happy to help here with any recommendations you might need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses understand the tax implications of franchising, manage financial forecasts, and ensure compliance with Companies House and HMRC regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Franchise Agreement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A franchise agreement is a legally binding contract that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the franchisor (you) and the franchisee. This agreement will cover:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Initial franchise fees</strong> and ongoing royalties;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Territory rights</strong>, including where franchisees can operate;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operational requirements</strong>, such as how franchisees should follow your business model; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Termination clauses</strong>, in case a franchisee doesn’t meet expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your franchise agreement is thorough and compliant with UK law by working closely with a legal expert (need a recommendation? Just ask!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Build Your Franchise Package</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To attract franchisees, you’ll need to create a comprehensive <strong>franchise package</strong> that details what they’ll receive in exchange for their investment. This typically includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Brand rights</strong>: The ability to use your brand name, logo, and marketing materials;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Training and support</strong>: Initial training and ongoing support to help franchisees get their business off the ground; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketing resources</strong>: Tools and strategies to help franchisees attract customers and build brand awareness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5: Recruit Franchisees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the right franchisees is critical to your success. Your ideal franchisee should be motivated, entrepreneurial, and passionate about your brand. You can recruit franchisees through:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Franchise expos and events</strong>;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Online franchise directories</strong>; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business networks</strong> and referrals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, it’s not just about finding anyone with the funds to buy a franchise—it’s about finding people who are aligned with your values and capable of representing your brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 6: Support Your Franchisees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your franchisees are up and running, your role as a franchisor is to provide ongoing support. This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Continuous training</strong>: As your business evolves, so should the knowledge of your franchisees;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operational assistance</strong>: Helping franchisees navigate any challenges they encounter; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketing support</strong>: Offering centralised marketing campaigns that benefit all franchise locations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your success is tied to your franchisees’ success, so make sure they have the tools and support they need to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Successful Franchising</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchising is a significant commitment, and ensuring success requires careful planning and execution. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Protect Your Intellectual Property (IP)</strong><br>Your brand is one of your most valuable assets. Make sure to <strong>trademark your business name</strong>, logo, and other intellectual property before you begin franchising to avoid legal disputes down the road.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Start Small</strong><br>Don’t try to open too many franchises too quickly. Start with one or two, allowing you to refine your systems, learn from your mistakes, and ensure your franchisees are operating successfully before expanding further.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stay Involved</strong><br>Even though your franchisees will be running their own businesses, it’s essential to stay actively involved. Regular check-ins, performance reviews, and open communication are key to maintaining brand consistency and ensuring your franchisees’ success.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternatives to Franchising?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for alternative ways to scale your business rapidly beyond franchising, there are several effective strategies to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Embrace Technology:</strong> Leveraging digital tools and platforms can streamline operations, improve customer interactions, and increase efficiency. This can involve implementing customer relationship management (CRM) systems or utilising e-commerce solutions to reach a broader audience​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Expand Your Offerings:</strong> Diversifying your products or services can attract new customers and increase revenue streams. This can include introducing complementary products, enhancing existing services, or even developing entirely new offerings based on customer feedback and market trends.​</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on Customer Experience:</strong> Providing exceptional customer service can lead to repeat business and referrals. Happy customers are likely to share their experiences on social media, which can significantly enhance your brand visibility and credibility​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invest in Marketing:</strong> Increasing your marketing efforts, particularly through digital channels, can help you reach new customers more effectively. Utilise social media, content marketing, and email campaigns to engage your audience and promote your offerings​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Network and Collaborate:</strong> Building relationships with other businesses and industry professionals can open up new opportunities. Collaborations can lead to joint ventures, partnerships, or referral arrangements that can benefit all parties involved​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Standardise Processes:</strong> As you scale, it&#8217;s important to have clear and standardised procedures in place. This not only helps in maintaining quality but also allows for easier training of new employees as your team expands​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Measure and Analyse:</strong> Regularly tracking your growth metrics—such as revenue, customer acquisition, and market share—will help you identify what’s working and where adjustments are needed. Being data-driven in your decision-making can significantly enhance your scaling efforts​.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilise Outsourcing:</strong> As your business grows, consider outsourcing non-core functions to focus on your strengths. This can free up resources and allow you to scale more effectively without overwhelming your internal team.​</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Franchising for Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Franchising can be a highly effective way to grow your business rapidly, but it’s not a decision to take lightly. Ensuring you have a proven business model, the right support, and a clear plan in place will set you on the path to franchising success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we’re here to help you through every step of the franchising process, from understanding the financial implications to providing ongoing support for your franchisees.

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that tax rules can be confusing, and making incorrect claims can cost you dearly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re tackling a common misconception: <em>“Clothing is always a business expense.”</em> Many business owners assume that because they wear certain clothes for work, the cost must be tax-deductible. But HMRC has <strong>strict</strong> rules on what qualifies as a business expense—so let’s break it down!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: Any Clothing Worn for Work Can Be Claimed as a Business Expense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to see why people think this. If you’re dressing professionally to meet clients, representing your brand in public, or wearing something that you wouldn’t normally buy outside of work, surely it counts as a business expense, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wrong.</strong> HMRC does <strong>not</strong> allow tax relief on clothing expenses simply because they’re worn for work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Most Everyday Clothing is NOT Deductible</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC&#8217;s general rule is that clothing expenses can only be claimed if the clothing is <strong>wholly, exclusively, and necessarily</strong> for business use—and this is where most claims fall short.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Can’t Claim:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following types of clothing <strong>are not</strong> tax-deductible, even if you wear them exclusively for work:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Suits and Professional Attire</strong> – Even if you only wear your suit or smart dress for business meetings, HMRC considers this a <strong>personal</strong> expense because you could, in theory, wear it outside of work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Branded Designer Clothing</strong> – Wearing high-end fashion or branded outfits to promote a luxury business? Unfortunately, that doesn’t qualify either.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Casual Workwear</strong> – Jeans, shirts, or dresses that you wear to work—even if you only wear them for work—are still not considered a necessary business expense.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Can Claim: The Exceptions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While everyday work clothing isn’t deductible, there are a few key exceptions where HMRC <strong>does</strong> allow tax relief:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Uniforms &amp; Branded Workwear</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your clothing is a recognisable uniform (e.g., a branded polo shirt with your company’s logo or a high-visibility vest required for your job), then <strong>it qualifies as a business expense.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Protective Clothing &amp; Safety Gear</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your job requires safety gear—such as steel-toe boots, helmets, gloves, or high-visibility jackets—these are <strong>tax-deductible</strong> because they are necessary to perform your job safely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Costumes for Performers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work in entertainment—such as an actor, dancer, or magician—you <strong>may</strong> be able to claim for costumes, provided they are solely for performance use and not everyday wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Specialist Workwear</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you require specific clothing for a trade—such as a chef’s whites, a lab coat, or scrubs for medical professionals—this <strong>is</strong> considered a necessary business expense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Cost of Getting It Wrong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you claim non-deductible clothing expenses, you could face an HMRC inquiry, be required to pay back the tax relief, and even face penalties for incorrect tax filings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Smart Approach: Get Expert Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding what you can and can’t claim is key to avoiding mistakes and maximising legitimate tax deductions. At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses stay compliant while making the most of every tax-saving opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not sure if your expenses qualify? <strong>Get in touch with our team today!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more <em>Mythbusters</em> blogs, where we continue to uncover the truth behind common financial misconceptions and help businesses like yours take control of their finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Scaling your business is one of the most exciting phases of entrepreneurship—it’s the moment you realise that your hard work is paying off, and you’re ready to take your business to the next level. But scaling isn’t just about growing bigger; it’s about growing <strong>smarter</strong>. Knowing when your business is ready to scale can make the difference between exponential success and a serious misstep/failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we support dynamic businesses across the UK in identifying when and how to scale effectively. So, how do you know when it’s the right time to expand, hire, or increase your reach? Let’s dive into the key signs and strategies that will help you decide if your business is truly ready to scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. You’ve Achieved Product-Market Fit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling before you’ve achieved <strong>product-market fit</strong> is like trying to build a house on unstable ground. Product-market fit means that you’ve developed a product or service that solves a real problem for your target customers, and they’re willing to pay for it. If your business has a loyal customer base and consistent demand for your offering, you may have found that sweet spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To evaluate whether you’ve achieved product-market fit, ask yourself:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Is your customer base growing consistently?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are your customers returning, or better yet, recommending you to others?; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have you received positive feedback and reviews?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve achieved product-market fit, congratulations; scaling becomes about building on that solid foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Your Business Can Handle Increased Demand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start scaling, you need to ensure your <strong>operations</strong> are prepared to handle increased demand. Can your systems, supply chains, and teams keep up if your customer base suddenly doubles? Scaling doesn’t just mean having more customers; it means maintaining the same high level of service, quality, and efficiency as you grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what to evaluate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do you have the technology, processes, and infrastructure in place to manage increased sales?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is your team ready for growth? Do they have the skills and resources needed to handle a larger workload?; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are your suppliers reliable, and can they meet higher demands without delays?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; then your business might be ready to expand its reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Your Cash Flow is Strong and Predictable</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling requires investment—whether that’s in hiring more staff, increasing marketing efforts, or expanding production. Without strong and <strong>predictable cash flow</strong>, scaling could put your business at financial risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we often advise clients to focus on cash flow management before scaling. Here’s how to know if your finances are up to the task:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do you have consistent revenue over several months?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have you accounted for the increased costs of scaling, such as marketing, hiring, or purchasing additional inventory?; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can you access finance options like loans, credit, or investors to fuel growth if needed?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A healthy, stable cash flow is a key indicator that your business is financially ready to scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. You’ve Nailed Down Your Core Processes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling isn’t just about selling more—it’s about being <strong>more efficient</strong> as you grow. Businesses that scale successfully have rock-solid core processes in place, allowing them to streamline operations and maintain quality while expanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key processes to evaluate include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sales and marketing</strong>: Do you have a proven strategy for acquiring customers, and can it be scaled without losing effectiveness?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operations</strong>: Are your operational workflows optimised and scalable? Can you handle larger volumes without compromising service or product quality?; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer support</strong>: As your customer base grows, so will the demand for support. Is your customer service system prepared to scale?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’ve established efficient processes and automated tasks, where possible, scaling becomes far less risky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. You Have a Plan for Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling without a clear <strong>growth strategy</strong> is like setting off on a journey without a map. You need to have a detailed plan that outlines how you’ll expand and what resources you’ll need along the way. This includes everything from your marketing strategy to your hiring plan and financial forecasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what a solid growth plan should cover:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Market research</strong>: Is there enough demand in your target market to justify scaling? Are there new markets you can enter?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Revenue projections</strong>: How much do you expect to grow, and how will you manage the associated costs?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hiring plan</strong>: Will you need to expand your team? What key roles will you need to fill, and when?; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Technology and tools</strong>: What technology or tools will help streamline operations and support growth?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a clear, realistic plan in place ensures that you can manage the expansion without stretching your resources too thin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. You’re Ready to Hire Key Talent</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling often requires <strong>hiring more people</strong> to help manage the increased workload. But before you hire, make sure your team is set up for success. Do you have the right leadership in place to guide your growing team? Are you prepared to bring in experts who can fill any skill gaps in your business?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When scaling, it’s essential to hire strategically. Rather than adding staff reactively to deal with demand spikes, focus on bringing in key talent who can help drive long-term growth. Consider whether you need new hires in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Marketing and sales to drive growth;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Operations and customer support to maintain service levels; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finance and accounting to manage increased complexity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. You Have a Clear Competitive Edge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, scaling makes sense when you have a <strong>competitive advantage</strong> that sets your business apart from others in your industry. This might be a unique product, superior customer service, or an innovative business model. As you grow, it’s important to protect that competitive edge and ensure it scales with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What makes your business stand out in a crowded market?;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How will you maintain your unique selling proposition as you scale?; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are there new competitors that could challenge your growth plans?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re confident in your competitive edge, it’s a strong sign that your business is ready to expand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Scaling Takes Strategy, Not Just Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling a business is more than simply increasing your sales or expanding your team. It requires careful planning, a solid financial foundation, and a clear strategy to ensure that growth is sustainable. It’s not for everyone and even if your business is ready for it, are you? Is it what you want as your legacy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black and White Accounting</strong>, we work with businesses at all stages of their growth journey, helping them manage cash flow, optimise operations, and plan for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re unsure whether your business is ready to scale, we’re here to guide you through the process.

      "content": "\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’re here to help our clients stay informed, compliant, and ahead of the curve. A key legal change is coming soon that will affect all UK company directors and people with significant control (PSCs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From Autumn 2025, identity verification will be mandatory</strong> for directors and PSCs under new legislation introduced by the <strong>Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what the change means for you—and how we can help you prepare.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ What’s Changing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in <strong>Autumn 2025</strong>, all directors and PSCs will be <strong>legally required to verify their identity</strong> to Companies House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new rule is designed to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Help combat <strong>fraud and misuse</strong> of company structures</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure <strong>transparency and trust</strong> in UK business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prevent companies from being used for <strong>illegal activity</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, you won’t be able to file your <strong>confirmation statement</strong>, set up a new company, or submit other filings unless identity verification has been completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 Why You Should Act Now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the deadline is over a year away, Companies House strongly advises all directors and PSCs to <strong>verify their identity as early as possible</strong> to avoid last-minute complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially important if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your company has <strong>multiple directors or PSCs</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some of your directors are <strong>based outside the UK</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’re unsure if your personal details on the Companies House register are <strong>accurate or up to date</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting ahead now means less stress later—and we’re here to help make the process seamless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🛠️ How to Verify Your Identity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to choose from three methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Online via GOV.UK One Login</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fast and convenient</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires specific ID documents or personal data</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. In Person at Selected Post Offices (UK Residents Only)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’ll need to check your eligibility through the ‘Verify your identity for Companies House’ service first</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Through an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>For example, <strong>your accountant</strong> (like us!) or solicitor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We’ll securely handle verification for you and guide you through the process</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us know if you&#8217;d prefer us to verify on your behalf—we have applied to be an ACSP so will be able to assist you here shortly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔁 What Happens After You Verify?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity verification is a <strong>two-step process</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verify your identity and receive your <strong>Companies House personal code</strong> (this is <strong>unique to you</strong>, not your company). Keep it safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2 (from Autumn 2025):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to link your verified identity to your company roles by submitting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your personal code</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A verification statement for each role you hold</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House will release more details on this process closer to the time—but if you’re working with us, we’ll handle the next steps for you when they go live.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 Check Your Registered Information Now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before verifying your identity, it’s critical that your <strong>personal details match what’s held on the Companies House register</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are any discrepancies—like a different date of birth, or misspelled names—you may <strong>not be able to complete the verification</strong>. Check your company records today and update any incorrect information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some updates can be made online, but changes to incorporation documents (like director or PSC details) may need to be submitted by paper. We’re happy to help guide you through this if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚠️ What Happens If You Don’t Comply?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or another director or PSC <strong>fail to verify in time</strong>, you won’t be able to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>File your confirmation statement</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit certain other filings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Start a new company</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also face:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Financial penalties</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Being flagged for non-compliance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Legal consequences</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📣 Stay Informed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, we’ll keep you posted on future updates via our Blogs and Newsletter.

At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help businesses stay <strong>compliant, tax-efficient, and financially secure</strong>—and today, we’re tackling a common misconception in the construction industry: <em>“Construction workers can always be self-employed.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many construction firms and workers believe that <strong>self-employment status</strong> is a simple choice. However, <strong>HMRC has strict rules under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong>, and misclassifying workers can result in <strong>serious financial penalties.</strong> Let’s break it down and make sure you stay on the right side of the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “Construction Workers Can Always Choose to Be Self-Employed”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a common belief that if a worker wants to be <strong>self-employed</strong>, they can simply register as a subcontractor and avoid PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax. Some businesses also assume they can treat all workers as <strong>self-employed</strong> to avoid payroll responsibilities like National Insurance and holiday pay. <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The reality?</strong> Whether a worker is self-employed or should be on PAYE <strong>is not a personal choice—it depends on HMRC’s strict employment status tests.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: CIS &amp; HMRC Have Clear Rules on Employment Status</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the <strong>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</strong>, contractors must <strong>deduct tax at source</strong> from self-employed subcontractors before paying them. But <strong>not everyone working in construction qualifies as self-employed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does HMRC Decide If a Worker Can Be Self-Employed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC uses three key tests to determine <strong>whether a construction worker should be classed as self-employed or employed</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Control</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Does the worker decide <strong>when, where, and how</strong> they do the work?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can they refuse certain jobs?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are they responsible for their own training?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the contractor <strong>dictates how</strong> the work is done, the worker is likely an <strong>employee</strong>, not self-employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Financial Risk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Does the worker <strong>provide their own materials, tools, or equipment</strong>?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do they have business insurance?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can they make a loss as well as a profit?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the worker <strong>bears financial risk</strong>, they may qualify as <strong>self-employed</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Substitution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Can the worker send someone else to do the job in their place?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Or are they personally required to do the work themselves?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If they <strong>can’t substitute someone else</strong>, they are more likely to be <strong>an employee</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens If You Get It Wrong?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If HMRC finds that <strong>a worker has been incorrectly treated as self-employed</strong>, they will <strong>demand backdated PAYE tax, National Insurance Contributions (NICs), and penalties.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what businesses could face:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>PAYE &amp; NIC Back Payments</strong> – Employers could be forced to pay all missing PAYE tax and NICs for misclassified workers. ❌ <strong>Penalties &amp; Interest</strong> – HMRC applies fines and charges interest on late payments. ❌ <strong>Tax Investigations</strong> – If HMRC suspects payroll misclassification, they can launch a full tax inquiry. ❌ <strong>Legal Action</strong> – Repeated breaches of employment status rules could result in legal consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Stay Compliant with CIS &amp; Employment Rules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To <strong>avoid payroll headaches and HMRC penalties</strong>, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Assess Employment Status Correctly</strong> – Use HMRC’s <strong>Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST) tool</strong> to confirm whether workers should be PAYE or CIS subcontractors. ✅ <strong>Deduct CIS Tax for Genuine Subcontractors</strong> – If a worker is self-employed under CIS, deduct <strong>20% or 30%</strong> tax at source before paying them. ✅ <strong>Keep Accurate Records</strong> – Maintain proper records of contracts, invoices, and payments for all workers. ✅ <strong>Ensure PAYE Compliance for Employees</strong> – If a worker meets HMRC’s employment criteria, put them on <strong>PAYE payroll</strong> and handle tax correctly. ✅ <strong>Work With an Accountant</strong> – A construction accounting specialist ensures you comply with <strong>CIS, PAYE, and HMRC regulations.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Self-Employment in Construction Isn’t Always an Option</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a <strong>contractor</strong>, you need to <strong>get worker classification right</strong>—or risk hefty tax bills and penalties. If you’re a <strong>worker</strong>, make sure you understand your employment rights and tax obligations before agreeing to self-employment status.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get CIS &amp; Payroll Compliance Right with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help construction businesses <strong>stay compliant with CIS, payroll, and tax laws</strong>—ensuring you avoid fines while operating smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not sure if your workers qualify for self-employment?

It’s no surprise that tax compliance can feel like navigating a minefield. To simplify matters, HMRC has launched a new <strong>&#8220;Check if You Need to Pay Extra Tax&#8221; tool</strong>—but how does it work, and could it impact you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fast-growing, dynamic accountancy firm, we’re here to break it down and show you how this new tool could make—or break—your financial peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s the Deal with HMRC’s New Tool?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool is designed to help taxpayers determine if they might owe extra tax, whether from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Side Hustles</strong>: Income from freelancing, online selling, or gig work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rental Properties</strong>: Earnings from letting out a property.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings and Investments</strong>: Interest, dividends, or capital gains.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overseas Income</strong>: Earnings from abroad that haven’t been declared.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a move by HMRC to simplify the process for individuals who might unknowingly fall into non-compliance—a reminder that tax doesn’t have to be scary but must be taken seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Does This Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC isn’t just encouraging compliance—they’re stepping up enforcement. If you fail to report additional income, you could face:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Penalties</strong>: Fines of up to 100% of the unpaid tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interest Charges</strong>: Extra costs for late payments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investigations</strong>: An audit that could unearth other potential issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But don’t panic just yet—this tool isn’t just a stick; it’s also a helping hand. It’s designed to provide clarity and help taxpayers avoid common pitfalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Should Pay Attention?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your financial life is even slightly more complex than a standard salaried role, this tool is worth exploring. You should especially consider it if you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Run a side business or gig work</strong>: Income from Etsy shops, Uber driving, or freelance projects might be taxable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rent out property</strong>: Whether it’s a full property or a single room, rental income often comes with tax obligations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invest regularly</strong>: Earnings from stocks, shares, or crypto might be subject to capital gains or dividend taxes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Have international ties</strong>: Overseas earnings or bank accounts could be overlooked, landing you in hot water.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Benefits of Staying Ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This tool is not just about avoiding fines—it’s about seizing the opportunity to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understand your tax position</strong>: A clear picture of what you owe can help you plan better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Save money legally</strong>: By claiming allowances and deductions you might have missed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid stress</strong>: Knowing your affairs are in order gives you peace of mind.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can We Help?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the HMRC tool is a great starting point, tax rules can still be complex. This is where we come in. As a dynamic accountancy firm, we:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Analyse Your Finances</strong>: Our experts can review your entire financial picture to ensure nothing is missed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maximise Tax Efficiency</strong>: We identify allowances, deductions, and reliefs to minimise your tax burden.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Provide Ongoing Support</strong>: Whether you’re an entrepreneur, landlord, or investor, we keep you on track year-round.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Control Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax landscape is evolving, and HMRC is using advanced tools to ensure compliance. Why not be proactive?

      "content": "\n<p>Welcoming an au pair into your home can be an enriching experience for both your family and the au pair. However, understanding the legal and financial obligations of hosting an au pair in the UK is essential to avoid costly mistakes and ensure a harmonious arrangement. Here’s what you need to know about employing an au pair in the UK, including recent changes to regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is an Au Pair?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An au pair is typically a young person from abroad who lives with a host family, helping with childcare and light housework in exchange for accommodation, meals, and a small allowance. Au pairs are not considered employees but are instead viewed as part of a cultural exchange program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Pay an Au Pair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The payment for au pairs is not a formal salary but an agreed-upon “pocket money” allowance. In the UK, this is generally around £80-£110 per week for 25-30 hours of work, plus a few evenings of babysitting. If your au pair works additional hours, you should offer additional pay or benefits, such as transport costs or extra holidays. From April 2024, the national minimum wage applies to au pairs, as detailed further below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Pay an Au Pair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Payments to an au pair are typically made weekly or monthly and can be done via:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Bank transfer:</strong> The most common and trackable method.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cash:</strong> Less common but acceptable if both parties agree.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure all payments are documented for clarity and to avoid disputes. It’s also good practice to provide a simple contract outlining the agreed terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legal Requirements for Employing an Au Pair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While au pairs are not considered employees, there are still legal considerations to keep in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Immigration Status</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Post-Brexit, EU nationals no longer have automatic rights to live and work in the UK. Ensure your au pair has the appropriate visa, such as the Youth Mobility Scheme visa.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA may also be eligible under specific visa arrangements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. National Minimum Wage (NMW)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Recent changes mean au pairs are now entitled to the National Minimum Wage (NMW) if they perform regular childcare or household duties. This includes the following rates from April 2024:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Aged 21 and over:</strong> £11.44 per hour</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Aged 18 to 20:</strong> £8.60 per hour</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Aged under 18:</strong> £6.40 per hour</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Families must ensure they comply with these wage requirements to avoid potential legal issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Tax and National Insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Au pairs are generally not liable for tax or National Insurance if they receive only pocket money and accommodation. However, if they earn more than the personal allowance threshold or have additional income, these rules may apply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Accommodation Standards</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Provide a private room in your home, meals, and access to essential facilities. Living conditions should be comfortable and in line with UK housing standards.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Working Hours and Time Off</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Limit their working hours to 25-30 hours per week.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer at least one full day off each week and ensure flexibility for language classes or cultural experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recent Changes and Key Considerations</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Post-Brexit Impact:</strong> The end of freedom of movement has limited the pool of EU nationals eligible to become au pairs. Families must now navigate stricter immigration rules and ensure their au pair has the right to stay and work in the UK.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Safeguarding Checks:</strong> Conduct thorough background checks, including references and, where possible, a police clearance certificate from their home country.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Inform your home insurer about the arrangement and consider public liability insurance to cover potential accidents or damage caused by the au pair.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Useful Tips</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Clear Expectations:</strong> Discuss and document responsibilities, working hours, and house rules upfront to avoid misunderstandings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong> Encourage your au pair to share their culture while immersing themselves in yours, enriching the experience for your whole family.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support and Training:</strong> Offer guidance, particularly in the early days, to help your au pair adapt to your family’s routine and childcare practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an au pair can be a rewarding experience for your family, providing invaluable support with childcare while fostering cultural exchange. However, staying informed about the legal and financial requirements is vital. By planning ahead and adhering to UK regulations, you can avoid pitfalls and ensure a smooth, positive experience for everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help navigating the complexities of hosting an au pair or understanding your financial obligations, Black and White Accounting is here to assist.

Disorganised financial processes can lead to confusion, missed opportunities, and ultimately, a detrimental impact on your bottom line. Fortunately, with the right strategies, you can transform chaos into clarity. Let’s explore how to streamline your financial processes for better efficiency and growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we are here to help you streamline your financial process by reviewing and proposing improvements, or by running them for you, so you can focus on what you do best; running your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Streamlining Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Streamlining your financial processes isn&#8217;t just about tidiness; it’s about enhancing your overall business efficiency. A well-organised financial system can lead to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improved Decision-Making:</strong> When your financial data is clear and accessible, you can make informed decisions quickly;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> Efficient processes reduce the time spent on mundane tasks, allowing you to focus on strategic initiatives; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> Streamlined operations often result in fewer errors and lower operational costs, boosting your bottom line.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Steps to Streamline Your Financial Processes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Assess Your Current Financial System</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by taking a comprehensive look at your existing financial processes. Identify areas that are causing delays or confusion. This could include manual data entry, disorganised invoicing, or inconsistent expense tracking. Understanding your pain points is the first step toward improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Implement Cloud-Based Accounting Software</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud-based accounting software offers real-time access to your financial data and automates many routine tasks. Programs like Xero, QuickBooks, or Sage can help you manage invoicing, expenses, and reporting more efficiently. Plus, they allow for easy collaboration with your accountant, enhancing accuracy and transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Standardise Processes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create standardised procedures for financial tasks such as invoicing, expense claims, and financial reporting. Document these processes so that everyone in your team knows their responsibilities and can follow a consistent approach. This not only reduces confusion but also ensures compliance with financial regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Automate, Where Possible</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automation is key to reducing chaos in your financial processes. Set up automated reminders for invoice payments and recurring expenses. Use tools that sync with your bank account to automatically categorise transactions, saving you time on manual entry and reconciliation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Regularly Review Your Financial Reports</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Establish a routine for reviewing your financial reports—monthly or quarterly, depending on your business needs. This practice helps you stay on top of your financial health and identify trends or potential issues early. Engaging with a proactive accountant, like us, during these reviews can provide additional insights and recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Train Your Team</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that your team is well-versed in your financial processes and the tools you use. Regular training sessions can help keep everyone updated on best practices and encourage adherence to established procedures. A knowledgeable team is key to maintaining clarity in your financial operations. We can deliver the insights or train your team and empower them to do this for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Engage Professional Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider working with an accountant or financial advisor who can offer tailored guidance and support. We can help you refine your processes, ensure compliance, and provide strategic advice to help your business thrive. This is exactly what we love doing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Transforming your financial processes from chaos to clarity is an essential step toward sustainable business success. By assessing your current systems, implementing technology, and standardising procedures, you can create a streamlined financial framework that supports better decision-making and efficiency. If you don’t do it now, it will be even harder to implement these key changes when you are even bigger and even busier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let disorganisation hold your business back. Take proactive steps to enhance your financial management today. If you’re ready to streamline your processes and gain greater clarity, reach out to us today and we can guide you on this journey. Your business deserves to thrive, and clarity is just a step away!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’re always on top of the latest regulatory changes so you don’t have to be. One of the most significant updates for UK companies is just over the horizon—and it’s time to start preparing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔄 Digital Filing of Accounts Mandatory from 1 April 2027</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Companies House has announced that from 1 April 2027</strong>, all companies will be <strong>required to file their annual accounts using commercial software</strong>. This marks a major shift, as <strong>paper and web-based filing methods will be permanently phased out</strong> on that date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you file your accounts yourself, or we do it for you here at Black &amp; White, this change means only one thing: <strong>software will be the only way to submit annual accounts</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🗓️ What This Means for You</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve got time to get ready.

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that tax rules can be tricky, and misunderstandings can lead to costly mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re tackling a common misconception: <em>“Business entertainment is tax-deductible.”</em> If you’ve been treating client lunches, staff parties, and networking events as tax write-offs, you might need to rethink your approach! Let’s dive into the truth about business entertainment expenses and what you <strong>can</strong> claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: Business Entertainment is a Deductible Expense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many business owners assume that because entertainment is related to work, it must be tax-deductible. After all, wining and dining clients, attending industry events, or treating employees is all part of doing business, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that may be true, <strong>HMRC doesn’t see it that way when it comes to tax relief.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Most Business Entertainment is NOT Deductible</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC has strict rules on entertainment expenses, and in most cases, you <strong>cannot</strong> claim tax relief on them. Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What HMRC Defines as “Entertainment”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Entertainment expenses cover things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Taking clients or suppliers out for meals or drinks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Corporate hospitality (tickets to sporting events, concerts, etc.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Staff entertaining (outside of specific exemptions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gifts to clients (except in limited circumstances)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because these expenses are not considered <em>wholly and exclusively</em> for business purposes, HMRC <strong>does not</strong> allow them as deductible business costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Can Claim: The Exceptions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While general business entertainment isn’t deductible, there are a few key exceptions that <strong>are</strong> eligible for tax relief:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Staff Entertainment – Some Costs Are Deductible</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain types of staff entertainment <strong>can</strong> be tax-deductible, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Annual Staff Parties</strong> – If you host a staff event (like a Christmas party or summer outing) and it meets these conditions, you can claim tax relief:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open to all employees</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Costs £150 per person (or less) per year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Includes VAT and all associated costs (venue hire, food, drinks, entertainment, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Marketing &amp; Promotional Events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you host an event <strong>solely for promotional purposes</strong> (such as a product launch where customers are invited), certain costs may be deductible. However, if there’s a strong entertainment element, HMRC may challenge the claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Gifts to Clients (Within Limits)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <strong>can</strong> claim tax relief on business gifts to clients if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They cost less than £50 per recipient per year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They carry your company’s name/logo (e.g., branded pens, diaries, or mugs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They are <strong>not</strong> food, drink, tobacco, or vouchers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Travel &amp; Subsistence Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re meeting a client away from your usual workplace, <strong>your own</strong> travel and accommodation costs may be deductible—but the client’s expenses (including their meals or drinks) are not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line: Know the Rules, Save Money</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Misunderstanding entertainment expense rules can lead to <strong>unexpected tax bills, disallowed expenses, and compliance risks.</strong> Rather than assuming everything is deductible, working with an accountant ensures you stay within HMRC guidelines <strong>while still making the most of legitimate deductions.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses navigate complex tax rules and identify all possible tax-saving opportunities—without falling into common traps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to ensure you’re claiming the right expenses and not overpaying tax? <strong>Get in touch with our expert team today!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more <em>Mythbusters</em> blogs, where we continue breaking down financial misconceptions and helping businesses like yours take control of their finances.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Building a business that can thrive without you at the helm might seem like the ultimate goal — and it’s entirely achievable. The concept of a self-sustaining business allows you to step back while your team and systems keep the engine running smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we believe in helping entrepreneurs design businesses that don’t just survive but thrive independently. Here’s how to build a business that runs without you, giving you the freedom to scale, grow, or even move on to your next adventure!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Build a Business That Runs Without You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: When you’re not directly involved in every decision, you have the space and time to focus on growth and new opportunities;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Valuation</strong>: Investors are more likely to invest in or buy a business that isn’t dependent on the founder; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Freedom</strong>: A self-sustaining business offers flexibility for you to take time off or pursue new ventures without disrupting the core operations​.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Steps to Building a Self-Sustaining Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Document Your Processes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a comprehensive, accessible operations manual is one of the first steps. Document everything from how customer service inquiries are handled to the financial processes involved in monthly reporting. By creating a clear “how-to” for essential tasks, you empower your team to manage day-to-day operations independently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top Tip: Start with the core processes that keep your business running smoothly, and refine as you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Build a Strong Leadership Team</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong leadership team can manage departments, make critical decisions, and carry out your vision effectively. Start by identifying potential leaders within your existing team and invest in their training. Alternatively, recruit experienced managers who can bring expertise and stability to your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Give your leaders the autonomy to make decisions within their areas of responsibility. This helps foster a sense of ownership and accountability.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Automate Where Possible</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With today’s technology, many tasks can be automated, from scheduling and customer service to financial tracking. Software and systems, like CRM and project management tools, can streamline operations and ensure consistency without your constant input. Automation tools save time, reduce errors, and free up your team for higher-level tasks​.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Review repetitive tasks within your business and explore software that can automate these processes.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Create a Performance-Driven Culture</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a performance-driven culture means setting clear KPIs and empowering employees to meet them. When each team member understands their goals and how they contribute to the business’s success, they’re more motivated and independent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Set KPIs that align with your business’s overall vision and make them visible to the entire team. Recognise and reward employees who consistently meet or exceed these targets.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Foster a Strong Brand and Vision</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear brand and vision guide your team, ensuring they make decisions aligned with the business’s values and goals. When everyone understands and believes in the company’s mission, they’re more likely to take ownership of their roles, making it easier for the business to operate smoothly without your day-to-day involvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Regularly communicate your vision and values to reinforce a unified company culture that your team can carry forward independently.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Delegate Decision-Making Authority</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, it’s vital to delegate decision-making authority to trusted leaders. Micromanaging every decision is not only inefficient but also discourages initiative and growth within your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Assign decision-making responsibilities in stages to give your leaders time to adjust to their new roles, and provide guidance along the way.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Prioritise Financial Independence</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create financial processes that support sustainable growth. This includes a reliable accounting system, budgeting, and cash flow management practices that don’t rely on your direct oversight. Financial stability is essential for a business that runs independently and supports decision-making across all departments. An accountant, like Black &amp; White Accounting,&nbsp; is critical to you achieving success here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Work with a professional accountant, like Black &amp; White Accounting, to establish financial practices that are robust, transparent, and easy to manage, even in your absence.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a business that can run without you isn’t just about stepping back — it’s about building a company that has the resilience and capacity to thrive on its own. At Black and White Accounting, we’re here to help you put the right systems, team, and strategies in place to make this a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re ready to take the next step in building a self-sustaining business, contact us today! Our expert team is here to help you achieve freedom, scalability, and long-term growth through effective financial and operational planning.</p>\n",

At Black &amp; White Accounting, we’re here to help you separate fact from fiction and ensure you stay on top of your business finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re busting a dangerous misconception: <em>“My business isn’t making money, so I don’t need to worry about tax.”</em> If you think a lack of profit means a free pass from tax responsibilities, think again! The reality is that <strong>even loss-making businesses need to stay tax-compliant.</strong> Let’s dive into why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Myth: “No Profit = No Tax Responsibilities”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a common assumption—if you’re not making a profit, you have nothing to report to HMRC, right? Wrong! While you may not owe <strong>corporation tax</strong> on profits, tax compliance involves <strong>more than just profits.</strong> There are still key financial responsibilities you need to stay on top of, or you risk penalties, fines, and even investigations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality: Even Loss-Making Businesses Must File &amp; Stay Compliant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you’re not making a profit <strong>doesn’t</strong> mean you’re off HMRC’s radar. Here’s why you <strong>still</strong> need to take tax seriously:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. You Still Need to File Your Tax Returns</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your business has made no money—or has made a loss—you <strong>may still submit a tax return</strong> to HMRC. For limited companies, this means:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax Return (CT600)</strong> – Required even if no tax is due.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Annual Accounts</strong> – Must be submitted to Companies House.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Confirmation Statement</strong> – Verifies your company details remain up to date.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For sole traders, you <strong>may still submit a Self-Assessment tax return</strong>, even if your earnings are below the taxable threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. VAT Returns May Still Be Required</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is VAT-registered, <strong>you must continue to file VAT returns</strong> even if you’ve had no sales. Failing to do so could lead to penalties—even if there’s no VAT to pay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Payroll &amp; PAYE Responsibilities Continue</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you employ staff, you must continue to run payroll and submit <strong>PAYE &amp; National Insurance contributions</strong>—even if your business isn’t currently profitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. You Might Be Eligible for Tax Reliefs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that business losses can work in your favour? If you report a loss, you may be able to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Offset losses against future profits</strong>, reducing future tax bills.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Carry losses back</strong> to previous tax years and claim a refund on past tax paid.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use losses against other income</strong>, if you’re a sole trader or partner.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Avoid Penalties &amp; Keep HMRC Happy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to file tax returns—even if you have no tax to pay—can lead to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Late filing penalties (£100+ for missing deadlines)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interest on unpaid taxes (if applicable)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HMRC scrutiny and potential investigations</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Smart Move: Stay on Top of Your Tax, No Matter Your Profit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring tax responsibilities just because you’re not making money <strong>can come back to bite you.</strong> Staying compliant helps you avoid penalties, claim valuable tax reliefs, and position your business for future success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let Black &amp; White Accounting Take the Stress Away</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business isn’t making money, worrying about tax is probably the last thing you want to deal with—but <strong>that’s where we come in.</strong> At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help businesses of all sizes stay compliant, claim tax reliefs, and plan for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don’t let tax myths cost you. Get in touch with our expert team today and make sure your business is HMRC-ready—profit or no profit!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more <em>Mythbusters</em> blogs, where we continue to bust financial myths and help businesses thrive with confidence.</p>\n",

But here’s the hard truth—<strong>poor record-keeping is one of the top reasons businesses fail</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’ve seen it all—from missing invoices to mismatched accounts that turn into financial nightmares. The good news? <strong>Avoiding this mistake is easier than you think!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Poor Record-Keeping is a Dangerous Trap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses don’t realise they have a problem until it’s too late. Here’s how bad record-keeping can impact your business:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🚨 <strong>Cash Flow Chaos</strong> – Without accurate records, you might think you’re profitable when, in reality, you&#8217;re bleeding money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Tax Trouble</strong> – Scrambling to find receipts at the last minute? Inaccurate records could mean overpaying taxes—or worse, getting penalised for underreporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔍 <strong>Missed Growth Opportunities</strong> – Without clear financial insights, you’re making business decisions in the dark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💼 <strong>Investor &amp; Lender Red Flags</strong> – Sloppy financials can scare off potential investors or banks, making it harder to secure funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5 Signs Your Record-Keeping Needs an Urgent Upgrade</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ You’re constantly searching for missing receipts.<br>❌ Your bank statements don’t match your financial records.<br>❌ You have unpaid invoices or forgotten payments.<br>❌ Tax season feels like a frantic scavenger hunt.<br>❌ You’re unsure how much profit you’re actually making.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Fix It – The Black &amp; White Accounting Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 <strong>1. Go Digital (and Stay Organised!)</strong><br>Ditch the shoebox full of receipts! Use <strong>cloud-based accounting software</strong> like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, or Sage</strong> to track expenses, invoices, and transactions in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🕵️‍♂️ <strong>2. Separate Business and Personal Finances</strong><br>Mixing personal and business expenses? That’s a recipe for disaster! Open a dedicated business bank account and use a separate credit card for business expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📅 <strong>3. Reconcile Your Accounts Regularly</strong><br>Schedule <strong>weekly or monthly reconciliations</strong> to match bank transactions with your financial records. This keeps errors in check and prevents financial headaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📝 <strong>4. Keep Digital Copies of Receipts</strong><br>Use apps like <strong>Dext or Hubdoc</strong> to scan receipts and automatically store them for tax time. No more lost receipts = no more tax-time panic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📊 <strong>5. Work with an Expert Accountant</strong><br>A growing business deserves <strong>financial clarity</strong>. At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help fast-moving businesses stay on top of their records so they can focus on what they do best—growing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts: Get It Right from the Start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good record-keeping isn’t just about compliance—it’s about <strong>control, clarity, and confidence</strong> in your business finances.

      "content": "\n<p>Struggling to pay your self-assessment tax bill by the 31 January deadline? Don’t panic—you’re not alone, and there are options to help you through. At Black and White Accounting, we’re here to guide you through this, one step at a time. Let’s dive into what you can do if you can’t pay on time and how to manage HMRC’s deadlines and expectations with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Take Action Quickly—Don’t Delay!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring your tax bill is a sure way to turn a small problem into a big one. If you know you’re going to have trouble paying on time, contact HMRC as soon as possible. They understand that life happens, and there’s a system in place to help people facing financial challenges. The earlier you reach out, the more options you have!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Consider Setting Up a ‘Time to Pay’ Arrangement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC offers a ‘Time to Pay’ (TTP) arrangement, allowing you to spread the cost of your tax bill in manageable monthly installments. This can be a real lifeline if you’re temporarily cash-strapped. Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can set up a TTP arrangement online if you owe less than £30,000, your tax return is up to date, and it’s less than 60 days after the payment deadline.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For larger amounts, or if you need longer to pay, you’ll need to speak with an HMRC adviser to discuss options. They’ll ask for details about your income, expenses, and assets, so be prepared.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Know the Consequences of Missing the Deadline</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing the 31 January deadline means you’ll face penalties and interest charges from HMRC. Here’s what to expect:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Penalties</strong>: An automatic £100 late-filing penalty if your return is late, even if you don’t owe any tax. After three months, further penalties kick in, so don’t delay!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interest</strong>: HMRC charges interest on late payments, currently at a rate of 6.5%, which can add up quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Review Your Tax Return for Accuracy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a moment to double-check your tax return. Simple errors, like missed expenses or incorrect income figures, can inflate your tax bill. An accurate return could reduce the amount due, making it easier to manage payments. Our team at Black and White Accounting can review your return to ensure you’re only paying what you owe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Use All Available Reliefs and Allowances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’d be surprised how many people overlook tax reliefs and allowances! From marriage allowance transfers to claiming expenses if you work from home, every little bit counts. Our tax specialists can identify allowances you might have missed, potentially reducing your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Explore Short-Term Financing Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a TTP arrangement isn’t enough, consider exploring short-term financing options. This could include a low-interest loan, credit card, or even borrowing from family or friends if the terms are manageable. Be mindful of interest rates, and ensure you have a plan to repay to avoid compounding debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Plan for Next Year—Take Control of Your Cash Flow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If this isn’t the first time you’ve found yourself scrambling to meet the tax deadline, it’s time to re-evaluate your cash flow strategy. Setting aside money monthly or quarterly can help you avoid a cash crunch in January. Our advisors at Black and White Accounting can help you set up a proactive tax plan tailored to your unique circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Stay Positive—There’s a Way Forward!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, remember that not being able to pay by 31 January doesn’t spell disaster. With the right approach and timely action, you can navigate this without sinking deeper into stress or debt. At Black and White Accounting, we specialize in helping individuals like you manage their tax responsibilities with confidence and peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need Help? Let’s Chat!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re worried about your upcoming self-assessment tax bill, contact Black and White Accounting today. We’ll review your options, explore tax-saving opportunities, and help you work out a solution tailored to your financial situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let tax stress weigh you down—take control, get support, and make a plan for a smoother financial future!</p>\n",

Banks and investors expect <strong>clean financials</strong>—not a messy mix of business dinners and grocery bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are You Guilty of This? 5 Warning Signs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ You use your personal bank account for business transactions.<br>❌ You pay for business expenses with your personal credit card (or vice versa).<br>❌ You transfer money back and forth between personal and business accounts with no clear tracking.<br>❌ Your accountant (or bookkeeper) regularly asks, &#8220;Is this business or personal?&#8221;<br>❌ Tax time turns into a stressful mess of sorting through old statements and receipts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Fix It – The Black &amp; White Accounting Blueprint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>1.

Pay Yourself a Salary</strong><br>Treat yourself like an employee—transfer a set salary from your business account to your personal account rather than dipping into business funds randomly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>3. Use Cloud Accounting Software</strong><br>Platforms like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, or Sage</strong> help track income and expenses, making it easy to see <strong>exactly where your money is going.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>4.

      "content": "\n<p>When you start a business, you often think about the obvious expenses: rent, salaries, inventory, and marketing. However, many entrepreneurs overlook the hidden costs that can significantly impact their bottom line. Understanding these hidden expenses is crucial for effective budgeting and long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting we are here to unlock these secrets and many others besides to help you not only survive but thrive, no matter what the environment. In this blog, lets explore these hidden costs, what they are and how to manage them effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Hidden Costs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hidden costs are expenses that are not immediately apparent when launching or running a business. They can creep up on you and affect your cash flow and profitability if left unchecked. Here are some of the most common hidden costs that every business owner should be aware of:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Unforeseen Operational Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operational costs can go beyond basic expenses. Think about maintenance for equipment, software subscriptions, and utilities. Unexpected repairs or upgrades can quickly drain your resources. Regularly reviewing your operational budget can help you identify and prepare for these potential expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Employee Turnover and Recruitment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>High employee turnover can be costly. Recruitment fees, training expenses, and lost productivity during the transition can add up quickly. Investing in employee engagement and retention strategies can mitigate these costs, ultimately saving you money in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Taxes and Compliance Fees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxes can be more complex than anticipated, especially with VAT, corporation tax, and PAYE for employees. Failing to keep track of tax obligations can result in penalties and interest. Hiring a knowledgeable accountant, like us, can help you navigate these complexities and ensure compliance, avoiding costly mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Insurance Premiums</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most business owners factor in basic insurance, they may overlook additional coverage options such as professional indemnity, public, employers liability, personal accident, business interruption, cyber liability, or specific industry-related insurance. Assessing your risks and ensuring you have adequate coverage is essential to protect your business from unexpected liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Cost of Customer Acquisition</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquiring new customers can be more expensive than you might think. Marketing campaigns, promotional offers, and the time spent converting leads into sales can all add up. Understanding your customer acquisition cost (CAC) and continually refining your marketing strategies can improve profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Opportunity Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every business decision comes with opportunity costs—the potential benefits you miss out on when choosing one option over another. For example, investing in one project may mean forgoing another profitable opportunity. Analysing potential returns on different ventures can help you make informed choices that maximise your resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Managing Hidden Costs Effectively</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’re aware of some of these hidden costs, here are some strategies to manage them effectively:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Conduct Regular Financial Reviews</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regularly review your financial statements and budgets. This practice can help you identify trends, unexpected expenses, and areas where you can cut costs. A professional accountant, like us, can assist in providing insights that may not be immediately apparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Budget for Contingencies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set aside a portion of your budget for unexpected expenses. A contingency fund can help you navigate surprises without disrupting your operations or financial stability. Most of our clients aim to build up a fund of six-months of expenses in a separate bank account so they are ready for a rainy day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Invest in Employee Development</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing training and growth opportunities, you can enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates. Happy employees are often more productive and committed to your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Utilise Technology</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automation and software can streamline operations and reduce human error. Investing in the right technology can save time and money, improving efficiency in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Seek Professional Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider hiring an accountant or financial advisor, like us, to help you understand and manage your finances better. Their expertise can help you uncover hidden costs and develop strategies to improve your financial health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the hidden costs of running a business is essential for maintaining profitability and ensuring long-term success. By being aware of these potential expenses and implementing effective management strategies, you can protect your business from financial pitfalls and set yourself up for sustainable growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let hidden costs catch you off guard. Take control of your finances today by conducting regular reviews, budgeting for contingencies, and seeking professional advice like talking to us at Black &amp; White Accounting. With the right strategies in place, you can navigate the complexities of running a business with confidence and clarity. If you’re ready to dive deeper into your financial management, consider reaching out to an experienced accountant who can guide you through the process. Your business deserves nothing less!</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The landscape of UK company law is undergoing significant transformation, heralding an era of greater transparency and accountability for businesses. These changes, primarily driven by the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, are set to modernise company regulations, bolster anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, and enhance trust in the corporate system. For fast-growing businesses and startups, understanding these changes isn’t just prudent—it’s essential for staying ahead in a competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Anti-Money Laundering, and Why Does It Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-money laundering refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illicitly obtained funds as legitimate income. AML measures are vital for combating financial crimes such as fraud, terrorism financing, and corruption. They protect businesses from being unknowingly implicated in illegal activities and maintain the integrity of financial systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, compliance with AML regulations isn’t optional. Penalties for non-compliance can include hefty fines, reputational damage, and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution. This makes it crucial for companies to understand their obligations under the evolving legal framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Changes to UK Company Law</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most notable updates to UK company law:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Introduction of Identity Verification</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors, Persons with Significant Control (PSCs), and those filing documents with Companies House must verify their identity. This measure aims to prevent the use of fraudulent or fictitious identities in corporate structures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Enhanced Powers for Companies House</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House will gain greater authority to query, reject, and share information. This marks a shift from being a passive registrar to an active gatekeeper of corporate data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Abolition of Corporate Directors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most corporate directors will be prohibited, with limited exceptions, to reduce anonymity and ensure accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Tighter Rules on Registered Office Addresses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies must demonstrate a connection to their registered address, making it harder to use fake or improper addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Greater Transparency in Filing Requirements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All company records will be stored digitally, streamlining processes and ensuring easy access for scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Updates to Financial Reporting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small companies will face simplified filing obligations, but certain exemptions may be removed to ensure consistent financial transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are These Changes Coming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government is introducing these reforms in response to increasing concerns about economic crime and the misuse of corporate entities. The aim is to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Enhance the UK’s reputation as a trustworthy place to do business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Protect legitimate businesses from exploitation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strengthen the ability of authorities to detect and prevent financial crimes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Key Changes to Watch For</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the above reforms, Companies House is expected to implement the following over the next few years:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Real-Time Filing:</strong> A push for near-instantaneous updates to company information to improve data accuracy and reliability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mandatory Digital Accounts Filing:</strong> All companies may soon be required to file accounts digitally using specific software.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased Collaboration:</strong> Companies House will work more closely with HMRC and other bodies to share data and combat fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What These Changes Mean for Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For startups and fast-growing businesses, these updates represent both challenges and opportunities. While the new regulations may require more robust compliance measures, they also promise a more level playing field, with fewer opportunities for bad actors to exploit the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how your business can prepare:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Keep up-to-date with regulatory changes and their implementation timelines.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhance Compliance Procedures:</strong> Review and strengthen your internal compliance systems, especially around AML checks and record-keeping.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leverage Professional Expertise:</strong> Partnering with a forward-thinking accountancy firm can ensure you’re not only compliant but also well-positioned to thrive in the new regulatory environment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Choose Us?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we specialise in helping businesses navigate the complexities of UK company law. From AML compliance to digital accounts filing, our team is equipped to provide tailored advice that aligns with your growth ambitions.

      "content": "\n<p>In today’s fast-paced business environment, <strong>KPIs</strong>, or Key Performance Indicators, are essential tools for tracking progress and guiding growth. But what exactly are KPIs, and why do they matter so much?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black and White Accounting, we know the importance of setting clear metrics and tracking results to drive success. Here’s everything you need to know about KPIs and how they can empower your business to reach new heights!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are KPIs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable metrics used to evaluate the performance of an organisation, department, or individual in achieving key objectives. Think of KPIs as your business’s compass — they help measure whether you’re on the right path toward your strategic goals​ and ensure your team are pulling in the same direction as you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Types of KPIs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Financial KPIs</strong>: Measure monetary metrics like revenue growth, profit margins, and cash flow;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer KPIs</strong>: Track customer satisfaction, retention rates, and acquisition costs to ensure you’re meeting customer needs;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operational KPIs</strong>: Monitor efficiency and productivity, such as production time, inventory turnover, or order fulfilment​; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Employee KPIs</strong>: Gauge employee performance and engagement metrics, which can influence overall productivity and morale.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are KPIs Important?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KPIs provide a <strong>data-driven foundation</strong> for decision-making, allowing businesses to focus resources on areas that generate the most value. By tracking KPIs, companies can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Align Team Efforts</strong>: KPIs help unify the team by focusing efforts on common goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify Success and Challenges</strong>: KPIs highlight both successes and areas needing improvement, allowing for quicker, more effective adjustments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhance Accountability</strong>: With defined metrics, employees understand what’s expected, making it easier to evaluate and improve performance​.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Choose the Right KPIs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting KPIs involves aligning metrics with your strategic objectives. Here’s how to choose KPIs that matter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Focus on Relevance</strong>: KPIs should directly relate to your specific business goals. For example, a sales-oriented KPI might track monthly new client acquisition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be Measurable</strong>: Good KPIs are quantitative.

Missing transactions, unnoticed fees, duplicate charges—<strong>it all adds up.</strong> And if you’re not keeping a close eye on your bank statements, you could be making decisions based on <strong>faulty numbers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? <strong>Fixing this mistake is easy, and it can save your business from financial disaster.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Ignoring Reconciliations is a Dangerous Gamble</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>🚨 <strong>Hidden Cash Flow Problems</strong> – Without regular reconciliations, you might <strong>think</strong> you have more money than you actually do. That’s a quick way to <strong>accidentally overspend</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Fraud and Unauthorised Transactions Go Unnoticed</strong> – Small errors and fraudulent charges can slip through the cracks if you&#8217;re not reviewing your accounts. <strong>Banks won’t always catch them for you!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔍 <strong>Duplicate or Missing Transactions Create Inaccurate Books</strong> – If an expense isn’t recorded or is entered twice, your financial reports will be <strong>misleading—hurting your decision-making.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>💰 <strong>Tax Headaches and Compliance Issues</strong> – Incorrect or incomplete records can lead to <strong>costly tax mistakes</strong> and potential fines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🏦 <strong>Bank Loans and Investments Become Harder to Secure</strong> – Investors and lenders expect <strong>clean, accurate financial statements.</strong> If your accounts don’t match up, you could <strong>lose out on funding.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 5 Warning Signs of Poor Reconciliation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ Your bank balance never seems to match your accounting software.<br>❌ You find duplicate or missing transactions when reviewing your books.<br>❌ You discover unauthorised charges or fees months after they happened.<br>❌ You’re constantly scrambling at tax time to figure out where money went.<br>❌ Your financial reports don’t align with what’s actually in your account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Fix It – The Black &amp; White Accounting Strategy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>1.

Match Every Transaction Properly</strong><br>Don’t just assume a transaction is correct. <strong>Check line-by-line to ensure it matches receipts, invoices, and payments.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>4. Investigate Any Discrepancies Immediately</strong><br>If something doesn’t add up, <strong>don’t ignore it.</strong> Investigate missing or duplicate transactions ASAP before they cause bigger issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>5.

But don’t panic—Black &amp; White Accounting has your back.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next few years, <strong>Companies House is undergoing the biggest shake-up in decades</strong>—and every business owner in the UK needs to pay attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you run a startup, small business, or multi-entity group, <strong>new rules are coming that could affect how you report, verify, and manage your company’s information</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’re keeping a close eye on the evolving picture—so you don’t have to. Here’s everything we know <em>so far</em> about the changes rolling out to <strong>2027</strong>, what it means for you, and how we’ll help you stay fully compliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <em>Note: Some of these proposals could change with the current political landscape. This blog is accurate at the time of writing, and we’ll keep you updated on any changes as soon as we know more!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📜 A Quick History of Companies House</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House has been around since <strong>1844</strong>, set up to bring transparency and accountability to UK business ownership. For years, it’s been <strong>more registrar than regulator</strong>, but that’s about to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act</strong> (passed in 2023) gives Companies House <strong>new powers to crack down on fraud, fake companies, and opaque ownership structures</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: Companies House is moving from a “filing cabinet” to a <strong>corporate watchdog</strong>—and these new rules are designed to make UK companies <strong>more transparent, trustworthy, and trackable</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚨 What Changes Are Coming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the key updates expected between now and 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🆕<strong> 1. Identity Verification for Directors and PSCs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every director and Person with Significant Control (PSC) will need to <strong>verify their identity</strong>—likely via a third-party (like us) or a new government portal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔐 This aims to stop fraudulent filings and fake appointments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📑<strong> 2. Changes to Accounts Filing Requirements</strong> <strong>(the government is currently considering a U-turn on some of these &#8211; we will update you as soon as we hear any news)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get ready for <strong>shorter, simpler, more digitally structured accounts</strong>—but with <strong>more information</strong> required, especially for small and micro-entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key updates include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Abolishing &#8220;abridged&#8221; and &#8220;filleted&#8221; accounts</strong> options</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>All companies filing a profit &amp; loss account</strong> (yes—even micro!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mandated digital tagging (iXBRL)</strong> for all accounts submissions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Potential <strong>public access to more financial information</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧾<strong> 3. ASCP (Accounts Submission &amp; Checking Platform) Launch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new online submission platform is coming that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Performs <strong>real-time checks</strong> on your accounts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flags non-compliance instantly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduces rejections and improves data integrity</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect this to become mandatory by <strong>2026–2027</strong> for all submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🧍<strong> 4. More Transparency on Shareholders and Company Ownership</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies will be required to provide:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Full shareholder information</strong> (not just at incorporation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More detailed PSC data</strong>, with stricter update obligations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Possibly disclose <strong>shareholder nationality and residency</strong> (awaiting final decision)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📤<strong> 5. Enhanced Powers for Companies House</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House will be able to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Query, reject, or remove filings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share data with other government bodies (e.g., HMRC)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Impose <strong>penalties</strong> for false or misleading submissions</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💬 Why Are These Changes Happening?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These reforms are part of a broader <strong>crackdown on money laundering, fraud, and economic crime</strong> in the UK. They’re designed to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Clean up the companies register</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increase trust and credibility</strong> in UK business</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protect the UK’s global financial reputation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it’s transparency first, excuses later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📋 Step-by-Step Guide to Get Ready</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> 1. Verify Who’s Who</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start identifying your directors, PSCs, and shareholders now. We’ll need to prepare them for identity verification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> 2. Review Your Filing Practices</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you currently file abridged accounts or use a DIY method, speak to us. We’ll make sure your process is future-proof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> 3. Update Your Records</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check your:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Registered office address</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SIC codes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shareholder register</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PSC statements</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> 4. Plan for Digital Compliance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll help ensure your software and processes are ready for iXBRL tagging and the new ASCP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> 5. Stay Informed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re keeping up with the latest updates, so you don’t have to. You’ll hear from us the moment something changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">❗ Don’t Panic—We’ve Got You Covered</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, these are big changes.<br>Yes, there’s still a bit of confusion about the details.<br>But <strong>no—you don’t need to worry</strong>, because <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> is here to help you every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Explain what’s changing, when, and why</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handle identity verification and compliance checks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Update your accounting process to meet new requirements</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor updates from Companies House and the government</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep your filings accurate, aligned and stress-free</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 In Black &amp; White: Our Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t just admin—it’s an <strong>evolution of how UK businesses operate and are held accountable</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House is going digital, going detailed, and going detective. But with the right support, <strong>you’ll not only stay compliant—you’ll look sharper, stronger, and more trustworthy to everyone from clients to investors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞<strong> Want to stay one step ahead of Companies House reform?</strong><br>Let’s get your business future-ready, streamlined, and fully compliant—with no stress, no jargon, and no surprises.</p>\n",

Less tax. No National Insurance. No payroll faff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ <strong>But here’s the deal</strong>: If they’re an employee, you <em>cannot</em> pay them outside of payroll.<br><strong>HMRC is red-hot on this—and the penalties can be brutal.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s unpack why this is a <strong>very bad idea</strong>, and what you should be doing instead to manage overtime costs legally and effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚖️ Why HMRC Says “Absolutely Not”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone is <strong>on your payroll</strong>, they’re an <strong>employee</strong>. All payments for work they do—even extra hours—must go through <strong>PAYE</strong>, with the appropriate deductions for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Income Tax</li>\n\n\n\n<li>National Insurance (employee and employer)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pension contributions (if applicable)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Holiday accrual</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Statutory protections</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to treat overtime as a <strong>separate invoice</strong>? That’s called <strong>disguised remuneration</strong>, and HMRC takes it seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will <strong>reclassify</strong> the payment and demand:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Backdated tax and NIC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interest</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Penalties (up to 100% of the unpaid tax)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and if the employee’s invoice came from a limited company? Welcome to <strong>IR35</strong> territory. Even more risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 Why You Can’t Be &#8220;Half In, Half Out&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t have it both ways—someone is <strong>either</strong> an employee (and all pay goes through PAYE), <strong>or</strong> they’re a genuine contractor (with their own clients, autonomy, and business setup).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the problem:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Factor</strong></td><td><strong>Employee</strong></td><td><strong>Contractor</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Works set hours?</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Uses your tools/systems?</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Under your direction?</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Can send someone else to do the work?</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your team member looks, sounds, and works like an employee—<strong>HMRC will treat them like one</strong>, no matter what the invoice says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 So, What <em>Can</em> You Do to Manage Overtime Costs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some legal, strategic alternatives:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Agree Overtime Rates in Advance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build it into employment contracts. You can offer enhanced rates—or not—but it must go through payroll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Offer Time Off in Lieu (TOIL)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of cash, allow employees to take extra paid time off later. It’s cost-neutral in the short term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Retains morale without extra cost<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Needs good tracking and management</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Performance Bonuses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider setting <strong>targets</strong> and paying a structured bonus for extra work, not hours. Still via PAYE—but more motivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Hire Genuine Freelancers for Short-Term Work</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need flexible support? Use <strong>external contractors</strong>—but make sure they&#8217;re <em>genuinely independent</em> (own tools, multiple clients, no control).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️ If you use the same person regularly, HMRC may still view them as an employee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 Other Things to Consider</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do you have <strong>clear overtime policies</strong> in place?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are overtime hours being <strong>properly approved and tracked</strong>?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is your current setup <strong>IR35-proof</strong> if using freelancers?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Could an <strong>EMI share scheme</strong> help reward key team members instead?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 <em>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help clients navigate this every day—legally, strategically, and smartly.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🧾<strong> In Black &amp; White: Our Verdict</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You CANNOT let employees invoice you for overtime</strong>.<br>It might feel easier, but the risks are real, the penalties are harsh, and it can seriously damage your business’s reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, build a solid overtime strategy that’s:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compliant</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transparent</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Motivating</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sustainable</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And let us help you design it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞<strong> Want to reduce payroll costs </strong><strong><em>without</em></strong><strong> putting your business in HMRC’s crosshairs?</strong><br>Let’s talk.

Here at Black &amp; White Accounting Limited, we know that taxes can be taxing—but they can also be downright bizarre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, before HMRC gets too creative, let’s take a whirlwind tour of some of the strangest taxes ever dreamt up by governments around the world—and what lessons we can learn before the UK decides to start taxing oxygen!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 Historical Tax Curiosities: What Were They Thinking?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The Window Tax (England, 1696–1851)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To raise funds without directly taxing income, a levy was introduced based on the number of windows a property had. The more windows, the higher the tax. Sounds simple—until people started bricking up their windows to avoid it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Taxing lifestyle proxies can backfire—people will always find loopholes. Also, natural light should never be a luxury!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The Beard Tax (Russia, 1698)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter the Great, in a bid to modernise Russia and align it with clean-shaven Western Europe, introduced a tax on beards. Want to keep your glorious facial hair? Pay a fee and get a beard token.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Social engineering through tax policy might make a statement, but it rarely wins popular support—especially from proud beard-bearers!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The Hat Tax (UK, 1784)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hats were once a clear status symbol. So, of course, they were taxed. Milliners (hatmakers) were required to buy licences, and hat purchasers were charged based on the hat’s value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Targeting fashion and identity for revenue may be short-lived—fashion evolves, and so will ways to avoid the taxman.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. The Cow Flatulence Tax (New Zealand, 2003 Proposal)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a surprising eco-driven move, New Zealand proposed a levy on livestock emissions to combat climate change. Farmers weren’t amused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> While green taxes are critical, if they hit too close to home—especially in an agricultural economy—they’ll face serious backlash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. The Candy Tax (USA, various states)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In some U.S. states, candy made with flour (like KitKats) is classified differently from flourless sweets (like gummy bears) and taxed at different rates. Sweet madness!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Over-complicated definitions in tax codes create inconsistencies and confusion. Keep it simple (and sweet).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 Could These Be the UK&#8217;s Next Big (or Bonkers) Tax Ideas?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Treasury eyes new revenue streams, here are some “creative” options—some serious, some silly—but all worth chewing over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Social Media Usage Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Targets time-wasting and data-hungry platforms. Revenue from the scroll-happy masses.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Hard to enforce. Would raise privacy and digital rights concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Luxury Pet Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> High-end pet accessories and “pawdicures” could be fair game.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Could hit ordinary pet owners with unnecessary costs. Cue public outrage (and protests led by pugs in hats).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Single-Use Plastics Tax 2.0</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Builds on existing environmental initiatives. Politically palatable.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Potential inflationary knock-on effects and increased costs for small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Home Office Perk Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Tax deduction rollback on home office setups could plug revenue gaps.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Could feel like a punishment for flexible workers and contradict remote work incentives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Digital Footprint Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Big Tech finally pays its “fair share” based on user interactions.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Could stifle innovation or push companies offshore.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎯 Final Thoughts: From Folly to Fiscal Planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>History shows us that tax policy, while essential, needs to be more than just clever—it must be clear, fair, and realistic. While it’s tempting to look for quick wins or gimmicky grabs, the long-term costs in compliance, reputation, and fairness often outweigh the gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we believe in <em>intelligent taxation</em>—transparent, simple systems that support both government and growth. As taxes continue to evolve, our mission is to help you stay a step ahead, with clarity and confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next time you&#8217;re grumbling over your self-assessment, just be glad you’re not being taxed for your top hat, your window count… or your beard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📣<strong> Got a question about how changing tax landscapes might affect you or your business? Let’s talk. At Black &amp; White Accounting, we turn tax confusion into clarity—without the beard tokens.</strong></p>\n",

If the business grows, they benefit from the increase in value. If it doesn’t, they’ve risked nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why it’s awesome:</strong> EMI options come with <strong>incredible tax advantages</strong>—for both you <em>and</em> your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 Why Use an EMI Scheme?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because talent is expensive—and people love feeling like they’ve got skin in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An EMI scheme allows you to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>🧲 Attract and retain high-calibre staff</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🔐 Lock in loyalty with vesting schedules</li>\n\n\n\n<li>📈 Reward based on future performance and growth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>💸 Avoid huge upfront salary costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🔥 Give a genuine sense of ownership and purpose</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s like a pay rise—without the payroll pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 How Do EMI Schemes Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s simple (with the right support!):</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>You agree a valuation</strong> for the company (with HMRC sign-off).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You offer selected employees the right to buy shares</strong> in the future at today’s value.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They don’t pay anything now—and only exercise if the company’s worth more later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When they sell the shares, they’ll pay just <strong>10% Capital Gains Tax</strong> (thanks to Business Asset Disposal Relief), instead of up to <strong>47% income tax + NICs</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 It’s the best of both worlds—<strong>equity without upfront tax</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 What’s Involved in Setting One Up?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the benefits are big, setting up an EMI scheme involves a few key steps and documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> The Process:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Check eligibility</strong> (your company and employees must qualify—more below).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Design the scheme</strong> (who gets what, when, and how).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Agree your company’s share valuation</strong> with HMRC.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Draft and issue option agreements</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Notify HMRC within 92 days</strong> of grant.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Manage the scheme</strong> with regular reviews and updates.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>📄 Key Legal Documents:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>EMI option agreement</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Board and shareholder resolutions</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Valuation submission to HMRC</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Company Articles</strong> (may need tweaking)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cap table and vesting schedules</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Black &amp; White Accounting can project manage the entire process—alongside your solicitor—to keep everything compliant and stress-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ Pros of EMI Schemes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Big tax savings</strong> for employees and employers</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No upfront cost</strong> to the company or employee</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drives loyalty and retention</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Highly flexible</strong> (performance, vesting, exit-only, etc.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increases exit value</strong> by incentivising performance</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚠️ Cons of EMI Schemes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Only UK-based employees</strong> are eligible</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Directors &amp; consultants can’t participate</strong> (though there are workarounds)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Legal and valuation costs</strong> to set up</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Must notify HMRC correctly and on time</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dilution of shares</strong> if exercised</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why getting good advice (like from <em>us</em>) is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧱 Who Qualifies for an EMI Scheme?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify, your company must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be <strong>independent and trading</strong> (not investment-based)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have <strong>fewer than 250 full-time employees</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have <strong>gross assets under £30 million</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Operate <strong>in a qualifying sector</strong> (excludes banking, farming, legal, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Work at least <strong>25 hours a week</strong> (or 75% of total working time)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not own more than <strong>30%</strong> of the company</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔁 Alternatives to EMI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every company or team member will qualify.

Right to Inspect Records</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can request to see <strong>company accounts and minutes</strong> of shareholder meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅<strong> 4.

Here’s our essential guide to what’s involved—and how we can help you do it the right way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📜 A Brief History of Charities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charities have existed in the UK for centuries, with roots going back to <strong>medieval times</strong>. The idea? Use wealth and resources to support the vulnerable and improve society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Charity Commission</strong> was established in 1853 to regulate charitable activities, and today, over <strong>168,000 charities</strong> are registered in England and Wales alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with great purpose comes great responsibility—and a lot of admin!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 What <em>Is</em> a Charity?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A charity is an organisation set up for a <strong>specific charitable purpose</strong>—such as relieving poverty, advancing education, promoting health, or protecting the environment. To qualify as a charity, your organisation must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be set up for <strong>exclusively charitable purposes</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide <strong>public benefit</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be subject to <strong>Charity Commission</strong> regulation (if registered)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>💬 Charities must be run by <strong>trustees</strong>, follow strict rules, and meet financial and governance requirements. It’s not just a label—it’s a legal responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🛠️ How to Set Up a Charity – Step-by-Step</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s your starter roadmap to turning good intentions into a legal, registered charity:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Define Your Charitable Purpose</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This must fall under one of 13 legal categories (e.g., relief of poverty, advancement of religion, education, etc.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Choose a Legal Structure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick the most suitable structure:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO)</strong> – most popular for new charities</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Charitable Company Limited by Guarantee</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unincorporated Association</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trust</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>More on the pros/cons below!</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Recruit Your Trustees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need a minimum of <strong>three unrelated trustees</strong>. These are the people who’ll steer the charity’s mission and stay legally responsible for compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Create a Governing Document</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This outlines your charity’s:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Purpose</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trustee powers and responsibilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decision-making rules</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Financial controls</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually a <strong>constitution</strong> (CIOs) or <strong>memorandum and articles</strong> (companies).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Register with the Charity Commission</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required if your annual income will exceed <strong>£5,000</strong> or you’re setting up as a CIO. You’ll need:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Governing document</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trustee details</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proof of purpose</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Financial projections</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Register with HMRC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>Gift Aid</strong> and tax reliefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚖️ Pros and Cons of Charities vs Other Structures</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Charity</strong></td><td><strong>Non-Charity (e.g. CIC or Ltd Company)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>✅ Tax reliefs (including Gift Aid)</td><td>❌ Fewer tax breaks</td></tr><tr><td>✅ Public trust and access to grants</td><td>❌ Limited grant eligibility</td></tr><tr><td>✅ Regulated by Charity Commission</td><td>✅ Easier admin and flexibility</td></tr><tr><td>❌ Heavier reporting and governance</td><td>✅ Faster to set up</td></tr><tr><td>❌ Restrictions on trading/profit distribution</td><td>✅ Can reinvest or pay dividends</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 <em>Charity not quite right?

But what if we told you… <strong>you could claim more than you think?</strong> At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we help sole traders, freelancers, directors and landlords <strong>unlock clever tax reliefs</strong> they didn’t even know existed. And sometimes, those allowable expenses are downright surprising. So before you file (or panic), ask yourself: “Can I claim that?” Because the answer might just be… <strong>yes.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 First &#8211; What Counts as an Allowable Expense?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC’s rule is simple (ish):</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s “wholly and exclusively” for the purpose of your business—it’s likely claimable. That doesn’t mean 100% business use only. You can also <strong>apportion costs</strong> (e.g. your phone or energy bills). And there are specific <strong>reliefs and allowances</strong> that go beyond just receipts. Let’s dive into the fun stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎉 10 Surprising Self-Assessment Reliefs &amp; Deductions You Might Be Missing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. </strong>📱<strong> Your Mobile Phone </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use your mobile for work and personal? You can still claim a <strong>proportion</strong>-based on your usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Same goes for broadband and landline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. </strong>🎬<strong> Netflix, Spotify or TV Subscriptions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a content creator, journalist, media pro, or performer-HMRC may accept entertainment subscriptions as a business expense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Just make sure it directly relates to your trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. </strong>🧑‍🎓<strong> Training Courses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning a new skill to expand your business? Training may be claimable-especially if it’s <strong>directly relevant</strong> to your trade or improves current knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🚫 Not claimable if it’s completely unrelated (e.g. a yoga teacher learning coding).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. </strong>🐶<strong> Security Dogs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a business premises that requires security-or a dog that protects your home office?<br>Some sole traders in <strong>rural areas or high-risk zones</strong> have successfully claimed <strong>guard dog costs</strong> or alarm monitoring fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ We’ll guide you if it’s legit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. </strong>🎭<strong> Makeup, Costumes and Uniforms</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your work involves performing, public appearance, or branding-costumes, hair, and makeup might be deductible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📸 This includes influencers, actors, and public-facing entrepreneurs (like YouTubers).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. </strong>🚘<strong> Car Wraps &amp; Branding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you wrap your car with your business logo or website? That’s a marketing cost!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just keep proof, and we’ll help claim it properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. </strong>🏠<strong> Part of Your Rent or Mortgage Interest</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working from home? You can claim a proportion of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rent (or mortgage interest)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Utilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Council tax</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cleaning</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internet and insurance</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We help you calculate it <strong>accurately and fairly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. </strong>🛠<strong> Tools and Equipment (Even Fancy Laptops!)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything you use to do the work-whether that’s a high-spec laptop, toolkit, microphone, or ring light, it can usually be claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Even if it’s under £1,000, you may qualify for <strong>Annual Investment Allowance</strong> or a simple deduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. 👦 Childcare Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Childcare costs can be claimed for any childcare needs during the school holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us advise before you claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. </strong>🧳<strong> Travel and Overnight Stays (Including Meals)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Client meetings, training events, or trade shows?<br>Travel, hotels, taxis, and meals <em>on the go</em> are claimable—<strong>but not</strong> your daily commute.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💸 Bonus: Don’t Forget the Big Ones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still shocked? Here are some <em>less surprising but often overlooked</em> reliefs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>£1,000 Trading Allowance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business mileage (45p per mile)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Capital allowances for home office furniture</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charitable donations (Gift Aid)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re married, the <strong>Marriage Allowance</strong> transfer can save up to £252 per year with a simple tick box.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 Why It Pays to Have Us on Your Side</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we don’t just tick boxes.

      "content": "\n<p>If the term “CCJ” sends a shiver down your spine—you’re not alone. Whether you’ve received one, worried you might, or just want to understand what it means for your finances or business, we’ve got you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In typical <em>Black &amp; White</em> style, we’re here to cut through the confusion and give you everything you need to know—straightforward, practical, and with your future in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📜 A Brief History of the CCJ</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong> is a legal tool used in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It’s been part of the UK’s legal system since the <strong>19th century</strong>, and its role remains the same: to formally settle unpaid debts through the courts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the way judgments are recorded and enforced has evolved with digital systems and online courts, the principle remains unchanged: <strong>you owe money, a creditor has gone to court, and now you’re officially obliged to pay</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚖️ What Exactly <em>Is</em> a CCJ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>County Court Judgment</strong> is a court order that tells you to repay a debt. It means a creditor has taken legal action and won their case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be issued to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Individuals</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sole traders</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Partnerships</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limited companies</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it’s registered, it becomes part of your credit file—and it stays there for <strong>6 years</strong>, unless you take specific steps to remove it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚨 How Does a CCJ Arise?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A CCJ doesn’t come out of nowhere. Here’s how it typically unfolds:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>You owe someone money</strong> (a creditor like a lender, utility company, or supplier).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>They try to collect</strong>—maybe by sending reminders, calling, or using debt collectors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>They issue a formal “Letter Before Action”</strong>, giving you a final chance to pay or respond.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>They apply to the County Court</strong> for a judgment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The court sends you a “Claim Form”</strong>—you usually have <strong>14 days to respond</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you don’t respond or fail to pay, <strong>a CCJ is issued against you</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧹 How Can You Remove a CCJ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All is not lost! You have options—especially if you act fast:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Pay Within 30 Days</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay the full amount <strong>within 30 days of judgment</strong>, the CCJ <strong>won’t appear</strong> on your credit file. It’s like it never happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Pay After 30 Days</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CCJ stays on your file but is marked as “satisfied”—better than nothing when lenders look you up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Apply to Set It Aside</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn’t receive the court papers or think the CCJ was issued unfairly, you can <strong>apply to have it &#8216;set aside&#8217;</strong>. You’ll need evidence—and often legal help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Wait It Out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If unpaid, a CCJ will automatically disappear <strong>six years after the judgment date</strong>, though your credit will take a beating in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧭 What Can You Do Once You Have a CCJ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve got a CCJ, take action. Here’s how to regain control:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pay it off</strong> as soon as you can.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Negotiate payment terms</strong> with the creditor or via the court.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek advice</strong>—the right support can make a big difference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Monitor your credit score</strong> to understand how the CCJ is affecting your profile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prioritise other debts</strong> to avoid getting more CCJs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At <em>Black &amp; White Accounting</em>, we’ve helped many clients negotiate settlements and rebuild their credit footprint after a CCJ—there is life after one!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💣 What’s the Impact of a CCJ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be blunt: CCJs are serious. Here&#8217;s how they affect you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>❌ <strong>Credit rating hits rock bottom</strong>—getting loans, credit cards, or even a mobile contract becomes difficult.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🏠 <strong>Mortgage refusals</strong>—lenders may reject your application outright.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🚗 <strong>Higher insurance premiums</strong>—yes, insurers check your credit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>👔 <strong>Damaged business reputation</strong>—especially for company directors or sole traders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, a CCJ can feel like financial quicksand—but there are ways to climb out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🛡️ How to Avoid a CCJ in the First Place</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prevention is better than cure. Here’s how to dodge the dreaded judgment:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Don’t ignore debt letters</strong>—burying your head won’t make it disappear.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Communicate with creditors</strong>—most are open to repayment plans.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep good records</strong>—you’ll need them if things escalate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Get professional advice early</strong>—we’re here to help you spot trouble before it lands in court.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 Other Handy Tips</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A <strong>CCJ against your limited company</strong> will appear on <strong>Companies House</strong> and impact your credibility with suppliers and clients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can search for CCJs using the <strong>Registry Trust</strong> if you suspect one might have been issued.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Businesses and landlords often check for CCJs as part of due diligence—don’t get caught out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ In Black &amp; White: Our Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we believe understanding your financial position is the first step toward taking back control. Whether you’ve had a CCJ, fear one’s on the way, or just want peace of mind, <strong>we’re here to offer straight-talking, expert support</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t judge—we help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💬<strong> Need advice or a check-up on your credit status?</strong><br>Let’s talk.

      "content": "\n<p><em>Short answer: No. Longer answer? Here’s why it’s risky—and what you should consider instead.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say it how it is: <strong>staffing costs are high</strong>. Employers&#8217; National Insurance, pensions, holiday pay, sick pay, admin, compliance&#8230; it adds up fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s no surprise that we hear this question from business owners all the time:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“Can’t I just switch my employees to contractors to save money?”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a tempting idea—<strong>no PAYE responsibilities, fewer benefits, greater flexibility</strong>… what’s not to like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the truth: <strong>HMRC hates this idea</strong>. And if you get it wrong, <strong>it could cost you more than you save</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break down why this isn’t the silver bullet it seems—and what smart alternatives you <em>can</em> explore.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">❌ Why HMRC Says No: “Disguised Employment”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t just <em>relabel</em> someone a contractor and carry on as normal. If they work like an employee, they&#8217;re an employee—<strong>no matter what the contract says</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is known as <strong>“disguised employment”</strong>, and <strong>HMRC is actively hunting it down.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ll look beyond the paperwork and assess the <em>true working relationship</em> based on:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚦 Key Employment Indicators:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do they work set hours?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do they have to do the work themselves (no substitution)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are they under your control (told what/when/how to work)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are they integrated into your team (email address, company laptop, management hierarchy)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can they make a profit/loss? Do they use their own tools or hire others?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answers look like “yes” to most of those—you’ve got an <strong>employee</strong>, not a contractor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 What Happens If HMRC Catches You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC will <strong>reclassify</strong> the worker as an employee—<strong>retrospectively</strong>. That means you could owe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Backdated PAYE and NICs (both employer and employee portions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interest on underpaid tax</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Penalties of up to 100% of the unpaid tax</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and <strong>your &#8220;contractor&#8221; could sue</strong> for unpaid holiday, pension, or unfair dismissal rights too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> It’s <em>not</em> worth the risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 What About IR35?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re working with contractors through their <strong>limited companies</strong>, IR35 rules apply. For medium and large businesses, it’s <strong>your responsibility</strong> to determine if the contractor is genuinely self-employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you get it wrong under IR35, <strong>you foot the tax bill</strong>—not them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 <em>Black &amp; White Accounting can help you run IR35 assessments and reduce risk.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ What <em>Can</em> You Do Instead?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to reduce costs <strong>sustainably and safely</strong>, consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Flexible Working Contracts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offer part-time, job share, or variable hours arrangements that <em>still comply with employment law</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Freelancers for Project-Based Work</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>True freelancers, operating independently and outside your control, are fine. Just be sure it’s a <strong>genuinely independent engagement</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Zero-Based Budgeting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start from scratch and re-evaluate every cost. Don’t just slash payroll—<strong>look at processes, subscriptions, systems</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Use Contractors Properly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need someone short-term for a specific deliverable? Hire a contractor with their own clients, tools, and schedule. But keep it legit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Offer EMI Share Options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivate key team members with ownership—not salary hikes. It’s tax-efficient and builds loyalty without extra cash outlay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about EMI schemes? We’ve got a blog on that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 In Black &amp; White: Our Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to disguise employees as contractors to save tax is a big, red-flag no-no. <strong>HMRC will see right through it—and punish accordingly.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn’t mean you&#8217;re stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help business owners:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Navigate IR35 and employment status rules</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimise workforce structure legally and ethically</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Explore cost-saving staffing strategies that <strong>don’t break the law</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Implement incentives like <strong>EMI schemes</strong>, performance bonuses, and lean operating models</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 Want to reduce your payroll costs <em>without</em> waking the taxman?<br>Let’s chat.

Timing Mismatch (aka &#8220;The Cash Gap&#8221;)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re invoicing like a boss… but your customers are paying late. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re paying your staff, suppliers, rent and taxes <em>right now</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> You&#8217;re profitable—but not liquid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Overtrading</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re growing faster than your cash flow can handle. More sales mean more stock, bigger wages, more overheads… but the cash hasn’t landed yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> The faster you grow, the worse your cash flow becomes (yes, really!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. High Debtor Days</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re giving customers 30, 60, or even 90 days to pay—and not chasing hard—<strong>you&#8217;re financing their business, not yours</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> Cash tied up in invoices you can’t spend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Poor Margin Control</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re selling more, but <strong>not making enough per sale</strong>. Maybe costs have crept up without you noticing, or pricing hasn’t kept pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> You’re busy, but not profitable enough to see cash stack up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Big Tax Bills Creeping Up</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>VAT, Corporation Tax, PAYE—if you’re not forecasting ahead, those chunky payments can wipe out your buffer <em>overnight</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> “Surprise” tax bills that were completely predictable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 How Do I Get Out of the Month-End Cash Struggle?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Tighten Up Debtor Control</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Introduce <strong>clear payment terms</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automate <strong>reminders and credit control</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer <strong>early settlement discounts</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charge interest on overdue invoices</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Faster cash in the door<br><strong>Cons:</strong> May impact client relationships (but a polite nudge goes a long way)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Forecast Like a CFO</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a 13-week rolling cash flow forecast that maps income, outgoings, VAT, salaries, and peaks/troughs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Predict and plan for cash crunches<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Needs updating and accuracy—don’t do it half-heartedly</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Review Pricing and Margins</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you actually charging enough? Small margin improvements can have huge bottom-line impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Improves profitability fast<br><strong>Cons:</strong> May need value-based pricing strategy (we can help!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Access Working Capital</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider short-term finance like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Invoice finance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business overdraft</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Growth loans</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Keeps you trading while waiting on cash<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Interest costs + you must stay disciplined</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Slash Hidden Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reassess subscriptions, supplier deals, inventory holding, and wastage. Cash isn’t just made—it’s protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Improves net cash position without selling more<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Needs regular attention and a sharp eye</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 In Black &amp; White: Our Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having low cash doesn’t mean your business is failing.

It affects sole traders, subcontractors, limited companies, and even property investors dipping their toes into development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we work with hundreds of businesses in the construction sector—and we’ve seen the same mistakes made time and time again. So let’s break down what CIS really is, why it matters, and how to stay HMRC-compliant without losing your mind (or your money).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧱 What Is CIS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Construction Industry Scheme</strong> is HMRC’s way of making sure tax is deducted <em>before</em> it gets spent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a <strong>contractor</strong>, you’re legally required to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Verify subcontractors</strong> with HMRC</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Deduct tax</strong> from their payments (20% if registered, 30% if not)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Report and pay</strong> those deductions to HMRC monthly</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a <strong>subcontractor</strong>, you’ll have tax <strong>deducted before you get paid</strong>—but don’t panic: it counts as <strong>advance tax</strong> on your year-end return, and you may be due a refund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>CIS is not optional</strong>—if you’re in scope, you must comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">👷 Who Counts as a Contractor or Subcontractor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re a contractor if you:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pay others to carry out construction work (even if it&#8217;s not your main business)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spend more than <strong>£3 million</strong> on construction in any 12-month period</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are a <strong>property developer</strong>, housing association, or local authority hiring workers for building-related tasks</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re a subcontractor if you:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Get paid by contractors for <strong>construction services</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are self-employed or a limited company (not on PAYE)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work as a plumber, electrician, decorator, roofer, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🛠️ <strong>You can be both</strong>! Many businesses act as subcontractors on some jobs and as contractors on others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 What Work Falls Under CIS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CIS covers a lot more than you might think:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Included in CIS:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Building work</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Demolition</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repairs and refurbishments</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Installation of lighting, heating, security systems</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Groundwork, site prep and scaffolding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Painting and decorating</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>❌<strong> Excluded from CIS:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Architects and surveyors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Carpet fitting</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delivering materials</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some professional consultancy services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manufacturing of off-site materials</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hiring plant (without operators)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 <strong>It’s the work done on-site that usually counts</strong>—and this is where contractors often get caught out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💸 How CIS Deductions Work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you’re a subcontractor invoicing a contractor for £1,000 of labour.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The contractor <strong>verifies you with HMRC</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’re registered?

Ouch.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You still invoice for the full £1,000—it’s just split between you and HMRC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>➡️ <strong>These deductions count toward your income tax and NI bill at year-end.</strong> You might even be owed a <strong>refund</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 How to Register for CIS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contractors must:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Register as a contractor on the HMRC website</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Verify each subcontractor before paying</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Deduct the correct amount (and not on materials)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit a <strong>monthly CIS return</strong> to HMRC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Give each subcontractor a <strong>payment and deduction statement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subcontractors must:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Register with HMRC under CIS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide UTR and verification details to contractors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep records and include deductions on their tax return</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claim a refund or offset the deduction against their Corporation or Income Tax</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 Need help? <strong>We register and manage this entire process for our clients.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>❌ <strong>Not verifying subcontractors</strong> before paying</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ <strong>Deducting tax on materials</strong> (this shouldn’t happen!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ <strong>Missing monthly return deadlines</strong>—resulting in automatic penalties</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ <strong>Not giving subcontractors proper deduction statements</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ <strong>Thinking CIS doesn’t apply because you’re “just a small builder”</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These slip-ups can lead to <strong>fines, tax investigations, or lost cash flow</strong>.

They might come from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Innovate UK</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Horizon Europe</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Local Growth Funds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Private or university partnerships</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re brilliant for innovation—but they do <strong>interact with R&amp;D tax credits</strong> in specific ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤯 So… Can I Claim Both?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yes—but not always on the same cost, and not always under the same scheme.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the key:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There are two main R&amp;D schemes:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>SME R&amp;D Scheme</strong> – The more generous one, for most small businesses</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>RDEC Scheme</strong> – Slightly lower rates, but compatible with grant funding</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If your project is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fully funded by a notified state aid grant</strong> → those costs must go through the <strong>RDEC scheme</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Partially funded by a grant</strong> → you split the costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Funded by a non-notified or de minimis grant</strong> → you may still use the <strong>SME scheme</strong> for some costs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 Real Example: How It Works in Practice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Imagine this:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You received a £50,000 Innovate UK grant. You also spent another £80,000 of your own funds on the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you might claim:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The £50,000 grant-funded part</strong> goes through the <strong>RDEC scheme</strong> (~20% return)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The remaining £80,000</strong> (if qualifying) could go through the <strong>SME scheme</strong> (up to 27% return)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a total potential cash benefit of over <strong>£25,000</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🚨 But if you or your accountant get the allocation wrong, <strong>you could lose thousands</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>❌ Claiming the grant-funded portion under the SME scheme<br>❌ Not separating out eligible vs. ineligible costs<br>❌ Assuming one project = one scheme (you can split!)<br>❌ Failing to track how grant funds were actually spent<br>❌ Missing out completely because “someone said you can’t claim both”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📊 How We Help You Maximise BOTH</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Analyse your grant agreements to understand the funding type<br>✅ Track your cost allocation across R&amp;D activities<br>✅ Identify which costs qualify for SME, RDEC—or both<br>✅ Create HMRC-compliant reports with zero fluff<br>✅ Handle the full submission and keep you stress-free</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The result? More funding, fewer errors, and faster payouts.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔁 Grants + Tax Credits = Smart Strategy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the thing:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant funding and R&amp;D tax relief aren’t enemies.<br>They’re <strong>powerful partners</strong> in your growth strategy—<strong>when used properly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a startup raising Innovate UK cash, or a scale-up looking at Horizon Europe support, <strong>you don’t have to pick sides</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🏁 Final Word: Don’t Leave Money on the Table</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve worked hard to build something new.<br>Don’t let a technicality cost you thousands in lost tax relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the right advice, you can claim both grant funding <em>and</em> R&amp;D tax credits—<strong>legally, cleanly, and confidently.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 Not Sure How Your Grant Affects Your R&amp;D Claim?<br>📧 hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk<br>🌐 <a href=\"http://www.blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">www.blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong> – Making innovation black and white, so your business can thrive in full colour.</p>\n",

That means:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The company earns profit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You <strong>don’t automatically own it</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can only take it out <strong>through salary, dividends, or loans</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So while it <em>feels</em> like it’s your money—it’s only yours when you extract it properly (and pay the tax).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💰 Option 1: Draw It Out (Take the Profit)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking money out of your company is essential—but how and when you do it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔄<strong> Main Options:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Salary</strong> – taxed as PAYE income</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividends</strong> – taxed at lower rates, but only from post-tax profit</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Director’s Loans</strong> – temporary, but watch out for Section 455 tax</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>💸<strong> Pros of Drawing Profit:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You get paid—obviously</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can fund your personal lifestyle, mortgage, pension</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spreads your income over time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May avoid future tax hikes (use your allowances now!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>😬<strong> Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You may lose access to cash you could reinvest</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividends can’t exceed profits—<strong>no profit = no payout</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overdrawing can trigger extra Corporation Tax (on loans)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Best for</strong>: Directors who need personal income now and want to optimise annual allowances (salary + dividends combo is usually most efficient).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🏦 Option 2: Leave Profit in the Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Letting profits build up in the business has serious benefits—especially if you’re thinking big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💡<strong> Pros of Retaining Profit:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Company pays <strong>only 19–25% Corporation Tax</strong> (vs 40–45% on personal income!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can <strong>reinvest in growth</strong>—new hires, stock, tech, R&amp;D</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build reserves for future tax bills, downturns, or funding projects</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can help with <strong>mortgage affordability</strong> (some lenders prefer retained profit)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delays personal tax until you <em>actually take</em> the cash</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️<strong> Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Money isn’t “yours” until you extract it</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sitting on large cash reserves might trigger HMRC scrutiny</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you die without extracting it, your <strong>estate may pay extra Inheritance Tax</strong> (unless you’ve done IHT planning)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Best for</strong>: Businesses planning to scale, reinvest, or retain flexibility. Also powerful for directors with multiple income sources or tax band considerations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧮 The Strategy: Blend Both</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The smartest move isn’t <strong>either/or</strong>—it’s a well-planned combo:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Take a salary up to <strong>£12,570</strong> (tax-free personal allowance)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Draw <strong>dividends up to your basic-rate band</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leave the rest in the company to reinvest or extract later at a lower tax rate</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach:<br>✅ Optimises tax<br>✅ Keeps you personally cash-healthy<br>✅ Builds business resilience</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔍 At Black &amp; White Accounting, we model this strategy <strong>specifically for your goals, tax position, and business needs</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 Bonus Tip: Use Profit for Pension Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to extract cash from your company <em>and</em> reduce Corporation Tax?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your company can pay <strong>employer pension contributions</strong> directly to you. It’s:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>100% Corporation Tax deductible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tax-free for you personally</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outside your estate for IHT (if done right)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📈 A long-term tax win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💥 What NOT to Do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what gets directors in trouble:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌<strong> Overdrawing the DLA</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowing cash from the company and not repaying it = Section 455 tax (32.5%) + benefit-in-kind risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌<strong> Paying Dividends Without Profit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Illegal—and flagged instantly in an HMRC audit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>❌<strong> Taking Too Much Too Fast</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulling all profits without planning = higher personal tax + loss of cash buffer + zero investment capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How We Help You Get It Right</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>✅ Calculate your optimal director’s salary/dividend split</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Forecast Corporation Tax + personal tax outcomes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Model different drawdown options and timings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Ensure HMRC-compliant documentation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Help with pensions, loans, and group strategies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Review it all <em>before</em> your year-end—not after it’s too late</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>No guesswork.

      "content": "\n<p>In a post-pandemic world, the question of where we work has become just as important as how we work. Whether you&#8217;re running a start-up, scaling a business, or navigating changes in your industry, choosing between working from home, hybrid working, or working from the office is more than just a logistical decision—it can make or break productivity, team cohesion, and even profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s best for your business? Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Brief History: How COVID-19 Changed Work Forever</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before 2020, remote working was often seen as a luxury, reserved for tech companies or forward-thinking freelancers. The traditional office setup reigned supreme, with long commutes and desk-bound routines. But then came COVID-19—a global pandemic that triggered the world’s biggest experiment in remote work almost overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ONS data, nearly 50% of UK employees worked from home during the first lockdown. Suddenly, kitchen tables became offices, video calls replaced boardroom meetings, and businesses discovered they could operate with surprising resilience—even without the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as a short-term solution became a long-term shift. As the dust settled, three dominant models emerged:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Remote-First (Work from Home)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hybrid Working</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office-Based Working</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Pros and Cons of Each Working Model</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working from Home</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cost Savings: Reduced office overheads, utility bills, and commuting costs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flexibility: Employees enjoy a better work-life balance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to a Wider Talent Pool: Hire talent from anywhere, not just your local area.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Isolation: Lack of in-person interaction can impact morale and mental health.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collaboration Challenges: Creative problem-solving and spontaneous discussions are harder remotely. This is particularly a potential issues for trainees and junior members of the team.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Productivity Gaps: Not everyone thrives without structure or a dedicated workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Expert Insight: A 2023 study by McKinsey found that 41% of remote workers felt more productive, but only 20% of managers agreed—highlighting the perception gap.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hybrid Working</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Best of Both Worlds: Combines face-to-face collaboration with remote flexibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased Autonomy: Employees feel more trusted and empowered.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Retention and Attraction: A popular choice among Millennials and Gen Z workers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Complex Coordination: Scheduling meetings and aligning team days can be a logistical headache.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unequal Experience: If not managed well, remote employees may feel excluded from key decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Expert Insight: According to CIPD (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development), 63% of UK employers said hybrid working boosted productivity in 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Working from the Office</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Team Cohesion: Stronger workplace culture and quicker communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easier Supervision: Managers find it easier to monitor performance and offer guidance. This is particularly important for trainees and more junior members of a team.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to On-Site Tools: Useful for industries reliant on physical infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Commuting Time: A major contributor to employee dissatisfaction and burnout.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overheads: Rent, utilities, and office maintenance costs can add up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limited Flexibility: May hinder employee retention in a world where flexibility is a key demand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Expert Insight: Gallup research indicates companies with rigid in-office policies experienced higher staff turnover than those offering flexible options.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Right for Your Business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. The right approach depends on factors, such as your:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Industry &amp; Operations: Do you rely on physical space or customer-facing roles?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Team Dynamics: Are your employees self-motivated or do they thrive in groups?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business Goals: Are you scaling fast or stabilising operations?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technology Infrastructure: Can your systems support remote or hybrid working securely?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It may also be worth piloting different models and collecting employee feedback before committing to a long-term structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Useful Considerations</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cybersecurity: Remote work introduces new risks—have you got the right systems in place?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tax Implications: Are your WFH allowances, business premises, and employee benefits optimised?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Productivity Tracking: Avoid micromanagement—focus on outputs, not hours worked.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wellbeing Support: Mental health resources, ergonomic equipment, and social engagement are crucial across all models.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Black &amp; White Accounting Isn’t Just Your Typical Accountant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we don’t just help you keep the lights on—we challenge your thinking to help you shine.

Renovated your office or upgraded machinery?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess what—that spending could <strong>slash your Corporation Tax bill</strong>.<br>Welcome to the world of <strong>capital allowances</strong>—HMRC-approved, totally legal, and <strong>massively underused</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we call capital allowances a <strong>tax hack for smart business owners</strong>—because when you know how they work, you stop leaving cash on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 What Are Capital Allowances?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital allowances are <strong>tax deductions</strong> for certain business purchases—typically <strong>assets that will last longer than a year</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of treating them as day-to-day running costs (like rent or wages), HMRC lets you deduct the cost <strong>gradually</strong> or in full, depending on the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result?<br>💥 <strong>Lower taxable profits</strong> = <strong>Lower Corporation Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🏗️ What Can You Claim Capital Allowances On?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be surprised at what qualifies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ Common Assets That Qualify:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>IT equipment (laptops, monitors, servers)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tools and machinery</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Company vehicles (vans, EVs, plant)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furniture and fittings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Air con, lighting, and electrical systems</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fixtures inside business premises</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integral features (e.g. lifts, heating)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>❗Bonus: Some R&amp;D costs also cross over into capital allowances.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔥 The Main Types of Capital Allowances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where it gets juicy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claim <strong>100% of qualifying costs</strong>, up to <strong>£1 million per year</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you buy £20k of new office kit—boom 💥—you can deduct it all in year one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Full Expensing (New from 2023)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses can deduct <strong>100% of qualifying main pool assets</strong> <em>with no cap</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially valuable for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Manufacturers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Construction firms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Businesses investing heavily in infrastructure or kit</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. First-Year Allowances (FYA)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applies to certain <strong>green or energy-efficient</strong> equipment (including electric cars). You can claim 100% in year one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⚡ Example: Buy an electric company car? You may be able to claim <strong>FYA + 0% benefit-in-kind (BiK)</strong> for the director. That’s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Writing Down Allowances (WDA)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For assets not covered by AIA or FYA, you deduct the cost over time (usually 18% or 6% per year depending on the asset class).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📉 Not ideal, but better than nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💷 Real-Life Example: The £15,000 Tax Saving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A growing design agency buys:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New iMacs and tech: £12,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Office refit and lighting: £28,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Electric van: £30,000</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of spreading the deductions over years, they use:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>AIA and FYA to claim <strong>£70,000 total in capital allowances</strong> this year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>That saves them <strong>up to £17,500 in Corporation Tax</strong> (at the 25% rate)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🎯 Real money back in the business, fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>😬 What If You Miss a Claim?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the kicker:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you don’t claim it—you lose it.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or worse, you underclaim and <strong>pay more tax</strong> than you legally need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why your accountant needs to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Know exactly what qualifies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Categorise your assets correctly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Time purchases strategically before your year-end</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include it properly in your CT600 (Corporation Tax return)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 Don’t leave this to guesswork or software alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤖 Capital Allowances &amp; MTD Software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using cloud software like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent, or Sage</strong> helps you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Tag capital assets properly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create asset registers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track depreciation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share info with your accountant in real time</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 But software is only as good as the setup—<strong>we configure it so you never miss a claim</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How Black &amp; White Accounting Helps You Claim Smarter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We go beyond basic compliance.

Some benefits are completely <strong>tax-free</strong>, provided you follow the rules:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎁 1. Trivial Benefits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are small, infrequent perks under <strong>£50 in value</strong>, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A birthday bottle of wine 🍷</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A team lunch 🎉</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A thank-you M&amp;S voucher 🛍️</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📌 <strong>They must not be cash or a reward for work performance</strong>, and directors of close companies are limited to <strong>£300/year</strong> in trivial benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>💻 2. One Work Mobile Phone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can provide <strong>one phone per employee</strong>—no tax, no NI, no problem.<br>It must be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Provided by the employer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The contract in the business’s name</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not reimbursed personal bills</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🚆 3. Work-Related Travel Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can reimburse:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Public transport to a client meeting</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overnight accommodation on business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mileage (at approved HMRC rates)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ These are <em>not taxable</em> if they meet the <strong>wholly, exclusively and necessarily</strong> test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎓 4. Job-Related Training</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courses that improve job performance or enhance workplace skills?<br>Totally fine. No tax. Encourage away!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🩺 5. Eye Tests &amp; Glasses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your employee uses a screen, <strong>you can cover eye tests and basic glasses</strong> needed for screen use. No tax here either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">❌ What Staff Benefits <em>Are</em> Taxable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the perks that <strong>do trigger a tax charge</strong>, either via <strong>P11D</strong> or <strong>through payroll</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🚗 Company Cars</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most heavily taxed benefits. Tax depends on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The car’s value</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Its CO₂ emissions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fuel type</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 Top Tip: <strong>Electric vehicles have far lower BIK rates</strong> (2% for 2025)—worth considering for directors!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🏥 Private Health Insurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A classic BIK. The value of the policy is taxable on the employee, and subject to Class 1A National Insurance for the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🏠 Accommodation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you offer rent-free or subsidised housing—unless it’s for the job (e.g. a school caretaker)—it’s a taxable benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🏋️ Gym Memberships</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you provide a gym membership (and it’s not on-site), <strong>it’s taxable</strong>—even if it’s for health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎟️ Entertainment Perks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tickets, event invites, or lavish staff parties <strong>over £150 per head/year</strong> can become taxable on the employee. Watch the limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧮 How to Report Staff Benefits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to stay compliant:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. P11D + P11D(b)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>File P11D for each employee receiving taxable benefits</li>\n\n\n\n<li>File P11D(b) to report <strong>Class 1A NIC</strong> due from the employer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Deadline: <strong>6 July after the end of the tax year</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.

So here’s everything you need to know—<strong>in plain English and with no fluff</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 Why Give Shares to Employees at All?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, shares make your top performers <strong>feel like owners</strong>. It aligns their goals with yours—grow the business, share in the rewards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Done well, offering shares can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>💪 Boost motivation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>💸 Attract and retain top talent</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🧠 Encourage long-term thinking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🧭 Share responsibility and vision</li>\n\n\n\n<li>📈 Add value to your business ahead of investment or exit</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But beware—it’s not always sunshine and equity. You need to get the <strong>timing, structure, and strategy right</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🕰️ When Should You Offer Shares?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the golden question. Some signs it might be time:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ You&#8217;re scaling fast</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you need to <strong>lock in talent</strong> who’ve helped build the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ You’re preparing for investment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>VCs love seeing committed, incentivised leadership teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ You’re approaching an exit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a great way to reward loyalty—and boost business value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ You want to keep someone who’s irreplaceable</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they’re already asking <em>“What’s next for me here?”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beware: <strong>don’t offer shares too early.</strong> Wait until you know:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They’re genuinely committed long-term</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ve seen their impact on business success</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your company is worth sharing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚙️ How Does It Actually Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>a few ways</strong> to structure this, depending on your goals and your business:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Straight Shares</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You issue shares directly to the employee. They become a shareholder today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple and clear.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Immediate tax implications, loss of some control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.

What counts as a digital record? And how can you make compliance <strong>quick, simple, and stress-free</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we’re not just here to tick the compliance box—we help businesses thrive by staying ahead of the curve. This guide will break down what <strong>HMRC expects</strong>, what we <strong>recommend</strong>, and how to <strong>turn digital VAT into a business advantage</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 A Quick Recap: What Is VAT and Why Has It Gone Digital?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>VAT (Value Added Tax)</strong> is a tax applied to most goods and services sold in the UK. If you&#8217;re VAT-registered, you must charge VAT on sales, reclaim VAT on expenses, and submit VAT returns to HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter: <strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong>.<br>Launched in 2019, MTD is HMRC’s initiative to <strong>modernise the tax system</strong>, reduce errors, and bring small businesses into the 21st century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of <strong>April 2022</strong>, <strong>all VAT-registered businesses</strong> must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep VAT records digitally</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit returns using MTD-compliant software</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to do so? Risk fines, lost data, or stressful audits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 What Does HMRC Expect from You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of what <strong>HMRC requires</strong> when it comes to <strong>digital VAT records</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ 1. Digital Record-Keeping</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must store key VAT information <strong>digitally</strong>. This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Business name and VAT number</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT accounting scheme</strong> used</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>VAT on sales and purchases</strong> (incl. rate, amount, and date)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Total daily gross takings</strong> (if using retail schemes)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjustments or corrections</strong> made</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Spreadsheets <em>can</em> be used—but only if linked via <strong>digital bridging software</strong>. Manual copy-paste is no longer acceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ 2. Functional Compatible Software</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must use <strong>MTD-approved software</strong> that can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Digitally record VAT data</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Preserve digital links</strong> between records</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit VAT returns</strong> directly to HMRC</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That means no more manual calculations or typing values into the HMRC portal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 What We Recommend (Because Good Enough Isn’t Good Enough)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we go beyond what’s <em>required</em>—we help clients set up a <strong>VAT system that saves time, improves accuracy, and supports growth.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we recommend:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>💻 1. Use Fully Integrated Cloud Software</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We suggest ditching spreadsheets altogether and switching to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Xero</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>QuickBooks</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>FreeAgent</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These platforms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep digital records in real-time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Auto-calculate VAT as you go</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Categorise transactions with ease</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create digital audit trails</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Link directly to your bank</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit VAT returns in a couple of clicks</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just about compliance—it’s about running your business smarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>⚙️ 2.

Keep Records Secure and Backed Up</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud accounting tools store your data safely, but we also recommend:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Two-factor authentication</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Regular data exports (just in case)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User access controls (so only the right people see what they need)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>MTD might seem like a burden, but it’s actually a <strong>huge step up in data security</strong> and resilience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 Bonus: What You No Longer Need to Do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to digital records:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>❌ You don’t need to keep paper receipts (scanned copies are fine)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ You don’t need to re-enter figures for every VAT return</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ You don’t need to worry about storing physical ledgers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But you <em>do</em> need to keep your digital records for <strong>at least 6 years</strong>—and keep them organised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We make MTD compliance seamless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A startup registering for VAT for the first time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A retailer managing multiple VAT rates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A service provider with international clients</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>✅ Choose and set up the best MTD software</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Digitise your VAT records properly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Train your team or manage your VAT for you</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Submit accurate, stress-free returns</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Prepare for any HMRC review with complete confidence</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not just about tax—we’re about <strong>peace of mind, saved hours, and scalable systems</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💬 Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Digital VAT compliance isn’t just a rule—it’s a smart move.</strong><br>The right tools and team can make it effortless and even empowering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re still stuck in spreadsheet mode, worried about errors, or not sure if your setup ticks HMRC’s boxes—it’s time for a better way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 <strong>Let’s Get Your VAT Digital and Done Right</strong><br>📧 hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk<br>🌐 <a href=\"http://www.blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">www.blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong> — Making digital tax work for real-world businesses.</p>\n",

Done right, a holding structure can help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Avoid Corporation Tax on Dividends Between Companies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your trading company pays a dividend to you personally, you’ll likely face <strong>Dividend Tax</strong> on top of Corporation Tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your trading company pays that dividend to your <strong>holding company</strong>, <strong>there’s no tax on it at all</strong>—it’s typically exempt under UK rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💥 That means profits can be passed up <strong>tax-free</strong> and reinvested elsewhere <strong>within your group</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Protect Cash from Trading Risk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading companies are exposed to risk—lawsuits, supplier disputes, cash flow issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A holding company can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Extract surplus profits</strong> out of the trading company via dividends</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hold them safely</strong> outside of legal risk</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use them to invest in new businesses or assets</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 Think of it as a tax-efficient safety vault.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Use Group Relief to Offset Profits &amp; Losses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got one profitable company and another making a loss?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a group structure:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Losses in one subsidiary can be <strong>offset against profits in another</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>This can <strong>reduce the overall Corporation Tax bill</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📊 This is called <strong>Group Relief</strong>, and it’s a powerful way to <strong>reduce tax without wasting losses</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Sell a Trading Subsidiary—Tax-Free</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the <strong>Substantial Shareholding Exemption (SSE)</strong>, if your holding company sells shares in a subsidiary (under the right conditions), it could:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pay <strong>0% Corporation Tax</strong> on the gain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep <strong>100% of the sale proceeds</strong> inside the group</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reinvest them in another venture, property, or new trading business</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 It’s one of the most misunderstood—and underused—tax reliefs in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Create a More Flexible Growth Vehicle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A holding company lets you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Spin off new ventures</strong> without starting from scratch</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separate risk between different businesses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prepare for investment or sale with clean structure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Move assets (with planning) between subsidiaries</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All while controlling everything <strong>from the top</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">👀 When Does a Holding Company Make Sense?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider one if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You run <strong>multiple businesses</strong> or income streams</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to <strong>protect assets</strong> (like property, cash, or IP)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’re planning to <strong>sell a company in future</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>One business is growing faster than another</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to <strong>minimise dividend tax and reinvest profits</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to build a <strong>long-term legacy structure</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 It’s not just for big corporations—<strong>we’ve helped startups, landlords, and consultants</strong> benefit from group structures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚨 BUT… Get Professional Advice First</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the tax benefits are powerful, there are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Set-up costs and admin</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Group VAT and payroll implications</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rules around <strong>connected companies</strong>, <strong>SSE</strong>, and <strong>HMRC anti-avoidance</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Company law to consider</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️ Set it up wrong, and you could lose the benefits—or worse, trigger a tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> steps in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How We Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve structured holding companies for clients in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Construction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Property investment</li>\n\n\n\n<li>eCommerce &amp; retail</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Professional services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tech startups</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Media &amp; creative agencies</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>✅ Design the right group structure for you</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Handle all Companies House and HMRC registrations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Ensure you qualify for tax exemptions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Help you with dividend planning and intercompany loans</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Manage your accounts across the group</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Keep you fully compliant (no nasty surprises)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 Final Thought: Build It Right from the Start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A holding company isn’t just about tax—it’s about <strong>strategy, security, and scale</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Done properly, it can help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Grow multiple businesses under one roof</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Protect what you’ve built</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unlock huge tax advantages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create something you can pass on, sell, or spin off</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us help you build a structure that works for <strong>your vision, not just your tax return</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 <strong>Thinking Bigger?

      "content": "\n<p><strong>You Might Be Surprised…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve had a great year. Invoices flying out, money coming in, the business account looks healthy. Then your accountant drops the bombshell:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You made a £70,000 profit. Your Corporation Tax bill is due soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait—what? You <em>don’t</em> have £70,000 in the bank. So how are you being taxed on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the world of <strong>taxable profit</strong>—and it might not be what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we love helping business owners understand the <em>why</em> behind the numbers. Because when you understand how profit is calculated for Corporation Tax, you can plan smarter, spend better, and <strong>legally reduce your tax bill</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s clear this up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 First, What Is Corporation Tax?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run a limited company, you pay <strong>Corporation Tax</strong> on your <strong>taxable profits</strong>—this includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Trading profits (what you earn from your core business)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investment income (e.g. bank interest)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Capital gains (profit from selling company assets like vehicles or property)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Profits up to £50,000 are taxed at <strong>19%</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profits over £250,000 are taxed at <strong>25%</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Between £50k and £250k? You’ll fall under <strong>marginal relief</strong>, a tapered rate</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 Your <strong>profit number</strong> isn’t just “what’s left in your bank account”—and that’s where most people get tripped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 So, What Counts as Profit?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where things get a little&#8230; surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ INCLUDED in Taxable Profit:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Sales Revenue</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one’s obvious. Anything your company earns from sales, services, or fees is part of your total income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Interest or Investment Income</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earned interest from business savings accounts or other investments? That counts too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Grants or COVID Relief (in some cases)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type, some grants must be included in your taxable income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Gains from Selling Assets</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sell a company car or equipment at a profit? That’s a <strong>capital gain</strong>, and it’s taxable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Some “Non-Cash” Gains</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like exchange rate gains or inter-company transactions may be included even if <strong>no cash changed hands</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>❌ NOT ALL EXPENSES REDUCE YOUR TAXABLE PROFIT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’ve spent money on things you <em>thought</em> were business-related, <strong>HMRC might disallow them</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some common examples of <strong>non-deductible expenses</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Expense</strong></td><td><strong>Deductible?</strong></td><td><strong>Why</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Staff salaries</td><td>✅ Yes</td><td>Fully allowable</td></tr><tr><td>Business rent, insurance, software</td><td>✅ Yes</td><td>Standard overheads</td></tr><tr><td>Business entertainment (clients)</td><td>❌ No</td><td>HMRC excludes this</td></tr><tr><td>Fines or penalties</td><td>❌ No</td><td>Even if business-related</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation</td><td>❌ Not directly</td><td>You claim <em>capital allowances</em> instead</td></tr><tr><td>Director’s dividends</td><td>❌ No</td><td>Not a business expense</td></tr><tr><td>Travel (home to work)</td><td>❌ Often no</td><td>Only allowable for certain journeys</td></tr><tr><td>Director’s pension contributions</td><td>✅ Usually yes</td><td>Great tax planning tool</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 Bottom line: <strong>Just because you spent it, doesn’t mean it lowers your tax bill.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧮 Example: The Surprising Profit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you run a small design agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sales: £100,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business expenses (staff, rent, software): £60,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business entertainment: £2,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You withdraw £20,000 as dividends</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what happens:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Taxable Profit = £100,000 – £60,000 = £40,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>That £2,000 entertainment? Not deductible. So HMRC <strong>adds it back</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Taxable Profit = £42,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividends? Not an expense. They’re taxed <em>personally</em>, not through Corporation Tax</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>💥 You’re taxed on <strong>more</strong> than you expected—and your cash flow might not match.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 Why This Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t understand what HMRC considers “profit,” you could:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Miss opportunities to claim valid reliefs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Forget to plan for your Corporation Tax bill</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leave money on the table</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why we always say: <strong>Tax planning is a year-round sport, not a year-end panic.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🛠️ The Tools to Get It Right</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <strong>cloud accounting software</strong> like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Xero</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>QuickBooks</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>FreeAgent</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>…can help you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Track income and expenses in real time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flag disallowable expenses automatically</li>\n\n\n\n<li>See your likely tax bill <em>before</em> it’s due</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stay MTD (Making Tax Digital) compliant</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we don’t just file your returns—we make the tools work <strong>for you</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How We Help You Stay Profitable (and Legal)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We go beyond the basics.

      "content": "\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we pride ourselves on staying ahead of the curve so that <strong>you</strong> don’t have to. With the announcement from HMRC that applications are now open for exemptions on the grounds of <em>digital exclusion</em>, now is the time for sole traders and landlords to act, seek clarity, and if necessary, secure their exemption from MTD IT. Here’s a full breakdown of what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📣 Big news: Exemption applications now open</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC has recently confirmed that individuals who believe they’re <strong>digitally excluded</strong> can now apply for an exemption from MTD for Income Tax. In summary:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>From 6 April 2026, individuals with <em>qualifying income</em> (self-employment or property) over <strong>£50,000</strong> will have to use MTD for Income Tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 6 April 2027, the threshold drops to <strong>£30,000</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 6 April 2028, it will be <strong>£20,000</strong> (for the 2026-27 year) as law is extended.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>But if you can demonstrate <em>digital exclusion</em>, you <strong>may</strong> be exempt from using the MTD digital system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re reading this and thinking: “Am I going to have to switch to digital reporting next year?”; the answer is likely yes, unless an exemption applies to you. And that’s where we step in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ What kinds of scenarios will HMRC accept for exemption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC defines “digitally excluded” as cases where <strong>“it’s not reasonably practicable”</strong> to use compatible software and keep digital records. Examples cited include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A taxpayer’s <strong>age</strong>, health condition or disability means they cannot use a computer/tablet/smartphone/software.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The taxpayer lives in a location where <strong>internet access is unavailable or unsuitable</strong>, and no suitable alternative location is reasonably accessible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A practising member of a <strong>religious society or order</strong> whose beliefs are incompatible with using electronic communications or keeping electronic records.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly: HMRC says that the taxpayer must show how their <strong>personal circumstances</strong> make digital compliance <em>not reasonably practicable</em>, not just inconvenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚫 What situations HMRC will not accept</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being clear about these will help you decide whether an exemption application is credible, and how we at Black &amp; White Accounting can help you build that case:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC guidance states that the following <em>alone</em> will <strong>not</strong> qualify for exemption:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Simply because you have <strong>always filed a paper tax return</strong> in the past.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You are <strong>unfamiliar with accountancy software</strong> &#8211; because unfamiliarity alone does not make digital reporting &#8220;not reasonably practicable&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You only have a <strong>small number of digital records</strong> to create each year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will cost <strong>extra time or extra money</strong> for you to sign up for and use MTD-software (unless that cost is combined with other factors like disability, remoteness, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: HMRC expects you to make a strong case. If you simply dislike or find digital systems inconvenient, you won’t likely qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 How to apply to be exempt &#8211; and how we help you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the application process, step by step &#8211; and where Black &amp; White Accounting can take the lead to support you all the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Check whether you need to use MTD for Income Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Work out if you’re within the thresholds (over £50,000 from April 2026, £30,000 from April 2027, £20,000 from April 2028) for self-employment/property income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re below the threshold, you aren’t yet mandated,  but you may <strong>opt in</strong> early.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you are above, then prepare to join MTD unless you secure a valid exemption.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Black &amp; White helps:</strong> We’ll review your income streams and projections, confirm your threshold status, and advise whether you’re in scope and therefore likely to need either to comply or to consider an exemption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Decide if you have genuine grounds for “digital exclusion”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Review whether any of your personal circumstances match HMRC’s examples: health/disability, poor internet access or geographical remoteness, religious beliefs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gather evidence: perhaps a statement of access issues, medical reports, religious society membership, or combinations thereof.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How we help:</strong> We’ll assist you in assessing your circumstances against HMRC’s criteria, pull together supporting documentation, and formulate the narrative why MTD is not reasonably practicable for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Submit the application to HMRC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The application must be made <strong>before</strong> you are required to use MTD. HMRC aims to respond within <strong>28 days</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Application can be made by phone or writing to HMRC (Self Assessment general enquiries). The letter should be headed: <em>“Making Tax Digital for Income Tax &#8211; digitally excluded application”</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll need to provide: your National Insurance number, name, address; how you currently submit your tax return; whether you use an agent (and what they do); your reasons and supporting information; details of any additional needs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How we help:</strong> We will draft or review the letter/application, ensure all details are accurate, liaise with HMRC (if authorised) and monitor the process so you don’t miss deadlines or required follow-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: After applying – what happens next?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>HMRC will issue a decision letter. If approved, you may continue submitting Self Assessment returns (paper or non-MTD digital) instead of joining the quarterly MTD updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If HMRC rejects, you have <strong>30 days</strong> from the date on the letter to appeal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Even while you wait for HMRC’s response, you should still <em>prepare</em> as though you may have to join MTD, keeping your records up to date and software ready.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your circumstances change (for instance, your disability improves or internet access becomes available) you must notify HMRC, because your exemption may no longer apply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How we help:</strong> We’ll keep you on track with deadlines, manage your record-keeping whether you’re joining MTD or awaiting an exemption decision, and assist with the appeal if required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🌟 Why choose Black &amp; White Accounting as your partner</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We’re a fast-growing firm with a dynamic approach: we bring the latest regulatory updates (such as this MTD IT exemption) to our clients <strong>proactively</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We specialise in helping small business owners, sole traders and landlords &#8211; the very groups most impacted by MTD IT.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We take the hassle off your plate: from eligibility assessments and income-threshold reviews, to compiling supporting evidence, drafting the exemption application, liaising with HMRC, and preparing you for either scenario (compliance or exemption).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether you <em>apply for exemption</em> or <em>move into full MTD-compliance</em>, we provide ongoing support so you’re never left navigating unfamiliar software or new processes alone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We believe in clarity, responsiveness and practical advice: no frightening jargon, just a clear path forward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 Final thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rollout of MTD for Income Tax is one of the biggest shifts in UK tax-admin for sole traders and landlords in many years. Being prepared matters. While the introduction of digital-recording and quarterly updates is the norm for most, the availability of <strong>exemption</strong> on grounds of digital exclusion gives a crucial lifeline for those whose circumstances genuinely make the digital route impractical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you might qualify for the exemption, or even if you’re unsure and want reassurance, now is the time to act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we’re ready to help you every step of the way: from checking whether you’re in scope, reviewing your circumstances for digital exclusion, to applying for exemption or guiding you seamlessly into MTD-compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>👉 <strong>Get in touch</strong> with us today, and let’s make sure your tax-journey is as smooth and stress-free as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s turn the unknown into “done and dusted”.</strong></p>\n",

The upcoming Autumn Budget is shaping up to be one of the most consequential and closely watched in recent years &#8211; especially for businesses, investors, and high-net-worth individuals. And as a dynamic, growth-driven accountancy firm, this is exactly the kind of event we live for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll walk through:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What the Budget <em>is</em> (in case any clients ask!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When it will happen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The big tax, spending, and policy changes potentially in the air</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What your business or personal finances should be bracing for</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What we (as your accountants) will be doing ahead of, during, and after the event</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What <em>is</em> the Budget (and why it matters)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its heart, the Budget is the Chancellor’s blueprint for how the UK raises taxes and spends money over the coming year (or years). It’s the moment when policy meets politics: tax thresholds, reliefs, spending priorities, welfare, investment incentives; almost everything in the public finances gets at least a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, the Budget is a potential pivot point. New tax burdens, changes in deductions, tweaks to compliance and enforcement; all of this can shift your planning, cash flow, and investment choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: it’s not just for economists and politicians. It’s for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When is the 2025 Budget?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark your calendar now: <strong>26 November 2025</strong> is the date the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will deliver the Autumn Budget to the House of Commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That date gives us a runway, but not a lot of slack. The lead-up period will be full of leaks, speculation, and shifting market expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s in Play: Key Areas to Watch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headlines are already filling up with speculation about what might change. Below is a curated view of the most plausible and impactful shifts we’re watching (and telling our clients to watch). However, these are still speculative, we will not know until the Chancellor enters the dispatches box exactly what is coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Tax thresholds &#8211; “stealth tax” through freezes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the favourites for raising revenue without headline rate hikes is simply <em>freezing</em> thresholds for longer. As wages and inflation push income higher, more people move into higher tax bands (fiscal drag). Analysts expect the freezes on personal allowance, higher rate thresholds, and possibly the Inheritance Tax (IHT) thresholds to be extended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tweaks to reliefs, loopholes &amp; pension rules</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than hitting headline rates, the Treasury may go after reliefs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Restricting the tax and National Insurance advantages of salary sacrifice schemes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limiting higher-rate reliefs on pension contributions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reforming or capping exemptions (e.g. on capital gains, residence reliefs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Closing loopholes” in property or other niches (often framed as fairness rather than new taxation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Property &amp; real-estate taxes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The property sector is under the spotlight. Some possibilities under discussion:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bringing property income (i.e. certain landlord rental income) into the scope of National Insurance contributions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reforming Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) or replacing it with a seller’s tax on high-value properties</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjusting Private Residence Relief (PRR) in high-value cases, perhaps capping it over a certain value or aligning CGT and income tax rates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New council tax bands, revaluation, or more aggressive taxation of second homes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes can carry knock-on effects; fewer properties listed, market uncertainty, and shifts in investor behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Personal &amp; wealth taxes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given pressures on public finances, there’s talk of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An explicit wealth tax (though this is politically and administratively tricky)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reducing the 25% tax-free pension lump sum or capping it for higher-value individuals</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Aligning CGT rates more closely with income tax for gains above thresholds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tightening Inheritance Tax reliefs and possibly extending the gift-giving rules (e.g. lifetime caps, cumulation rules)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Business &amp; corporation tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the government has committed (so far) <strong>not</strong> to increase the headline corporation tax rate (currently 25%), there is still room to tinker around the edges:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adjusting surcharge rates (e.g. for banks)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reducing the threshold for VAT registration or increasing the sectors it applies to</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tightening rules on deductions, capital allowances, or R&amp;D incentives</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compliance changes, penalty reforms, and more aggressive enforcement</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without a rate hike, a small adjustment to surcharges or reliefs can meaningfully impact tax bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Spending, public services &amp; investment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the spending side, many expect:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Further pressures on welfare budgets, eligibility criteria or benefit elements (though politically sensitive)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More capital investment — especially in infrastructure, green energy, technology, or regional growth zones (consistent with Labour’s “modern supply-side” agenda)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A push to maintain or increase public service funding (health, education) to match Labour’s manifesto commitments</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A need to balance growth and fairness in the narrative — tax rises must be justified as fair or targeted</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Might Rock Your Boat: Impacts &amp; Risks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the likely outcomes (and risks) that our clients should start planning for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cash flow shock</strong>: If new liabilities (or reduced reliefs) are introduced retrospectively or mid-year, businesses may face surprises</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investment decisions</strong>: Capital tie-ups, expansions, or M&amp;A plans could be altered or delayed until after the dust settles</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Property investors &amp; landlords</strong>: Any change in how property income or gains are taxed can mean higher costs, or changes in strategy (sell vs hold)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Individual tax planning</strong>: High net worth individuals or those near thresholds must reassess pension strategies, gifting, capital gains timing</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Administrative burden</strong>: More compliance, tighter rules, more HMRC scrutiny, the hidden cost of “fixing loopholes” is often compliance overhead</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Market &amp; sentiment risk</strong>: Investors, lenders and markets respond to uncertainty. A “bad” or aggressive budget could dampen confidence</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, there may be <strong>opportunities</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reliefs or incentives in areas the government wants to promote (R&amp;D, green, regional investment)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Restructuring or reorganising assets ahead of changes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Locking in favourable rates or treatments before they expire</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Early assessment of capital gains, pension allowances or gifting to reduce exposure</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Big Question: Will It Be “Painful”?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short answer: probably. The government is facing tighter public finances, higher borrowing costs, and pressures to meet its own fiscal rules. The fantasy of raising large new revenues without cost or friction is unlikely to survive the scrutiny of markets and politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the framing matters. If the Chancellor can thread a narrative of <strong>fairness, investment and growth</strong>, she may soften blowback. We do expect some tax rises or relief reductions, but likely with targeted exemptions or phased implementation to reduce political backlash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>How Black &amp; White Accounting Will Support You</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we know that budgets aren’t just about headline numbers, they’re about how those changes flow through to your business, your family, and your future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our approach is simple: we cut through the jargon and give you clear, actionable advice that helps you make confident decisions.

From tax codes to NI contributions, getting PAYE wrong can lead to <strong>underpayments, overpayments, HMRC letters, and confused staff</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we help employers keep payroll clean, compliant, and crystal clear—even when your team has a few extra gigs on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know to stay on the right side of PAYE—and keep your employees happy and HMRC off your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💼 First, Yes—People <em>Can</em> Have More Than One Job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s completely legal and increasingly common for employees to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Work two part-time roles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hold a job and run a self-employed business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have multiple PAYE jobs (e.g. hospitality or gig work)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But when <strong>you</strong> become one of those employers, <strong>PAYE rules still apply</strong>—and the setup might not be as simple as you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 The Key Issues for Employers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Tax Code Confusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone has multiple PAYE jobs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>HMRC usually applies the <strong>full personal allowance (£12,570)</strong> to just <strong>one job</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The other(s) will use a <strong>basic rate code (BR, D0 or D1)</strong>—which means <strong>all pay is taxed at 20%, 40%, or 45%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your payroll system applies the wrong tax code, your employee might:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Overpay tax (and get grumpy)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Underpay tax (and face a nasty bill later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 <strong>What you need to do</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Always use the tax code HMRC gives you (via a P45 or starter checklist)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don’t try to guess or “help” by assigning the full allowance unless you’re told to</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If no tax code is provided, follow the <strong>starter checklist rules</strong> to assign the correct temporary code</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. National Insurance Contributions (NIC)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the twist:<br><strong>NIC is calculated per job</strong>—not per person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if your employee has two jobs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They could end up paying <strong>NI twice</strong> on earnings <strong>below the threshold</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>HMRC may issue a refund—but <strong>months later</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 <strong>What you need to do</strong>:<br>You can’t avoid this—it’s how the system works. But you can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Inform your employee that NICs are per employer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Suggest they contact HMRC for a refund if they’ve overpaid</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Student Loans and Other Deductions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student loan repayments, Postgraduate Loans, and even Scottish tax codes are applied across <strong>all employment income</strong>—so it’s important each job uses the correct flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you forget to tick the student loan box during setup:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your employee may underpay</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HMRC may demand a correction later—through your payroll</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Always complete the starter checklist carefully—it includes student loan status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Benefits and Threshold-Based Triggers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your employee’s second job might push them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Over the <strong>pension auto-enrolment</strong> threshold</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Over the <strong>NIC primary threshold</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Into a <strong>higher tax band</strong> than expected</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Into <strong>student loan repayment territory</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 <strong>What you need to do</strong>:<br>Run your payroll as normal, based only on <strong>what they earn with you</strong>.<br>But advise your team to track their combined income and plan ahead.

      "content": "\n<p>In the fast-paced world of business, change is the only constant. But every so often, a regulatory shift comes along so profound that it demands attention and proactive preparation. The <strong>Companies House reforms</strong> set to begin on <strong>18 November 2025</strong> are exactly that kind of shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we believe in not just keeping pace, but staying ahead. Here’s what’s changing, why it matters, and how we will guide you through the new landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Changing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Companies House reforms stem from the <strong>Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA)</strong>, designed to modernise UK corporate registers, tighten anti-fraud controls, and dramatically raise transparency standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>18 November 2025</strong>, four core changes take effect:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mandatory Identity Verification (IDV)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Every new director and new Person with Significant Control (PSC) must <strong>verify their identity</strong> <em>before</em> incorporation or appointment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Existing directors and PSCs must verify their identity within a <strong>12-month transition period</strong>, typically aligned with their next confirmation statement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Abolition of Some Statutory Registers</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>From 18 November 2025, companies will <strong>no longer be legally required</strong> to keep registers of:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Directors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Directors’ residential addresses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secretaries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PSCs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Instead, those details will be maintained centrally by Companies House.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Companies will still need to maintain a <strong>register of shareholders (members)</strong>, either at the registered office or a <strong>single alternative inspection location (SAIL)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tighter Control on Who Can File on Your Behalf</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Only <strong>verified individuals</strong> (i.e. those who have passed ID verification) or <strong>Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs)</strong> will be able to file documents with Companies House.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>To act as an ACSP, a firm must register with Companies House and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) supervision.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Other Reforms in the Pipeline (Coming Shortly After)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While not in force on 18 November, the shift toward requiring <strong>all companies to file via commercial accounting software</strong> is scheduled to begin in <strong>April 2027</strong>. This change will replace paper and web-based submissions altogether.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 2027, many companies that currently file <strong>abridged accounts</strong> will no longer be allowed to do so; <strong>profit &amp; loss figures</strong>, directors’ reports, and fuller disclosure become the norm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: from late 2025, identity verification and register simplification hit first; by 2027, the full digital transformation of reporting follows. There has been speculation that the future reforms could be reformed, but this has not been announced yet. Rest assured if there are any changes, we will update you as soon as they are announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Is This Change Happening?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This overhaul isn’t arbitrary, it’s part of a bold mission to <strong>rein in economic crime</strong>, restore trust in the UK’s company registry, and bring the system into the digital age.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Combat fraud and shell companies</strong><br>  For years, weak verification has allowed entities to register under false names or addresses (think “Darth Vader Ltd.”). The new rules aim to close that loophole.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improve data quality, consistency, and reliability</strong><br>  By centralising and verifying key officer information, Companies House can reduce errors, standardise formats, and make the register more trustworthy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Simplify corporate administration</strong><br>  Removing redundant internal registers and consolidating statutory data handling should reduce duplication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Modernise and digitise reporting</strong><br>  The shift toward mandatory use of commercial accounting software is intended to reduce fraud risk, standardise submissions, and streamline operations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support enforcement powers</strong><br>  The reforms give Companies House sharper powers to query, challenge, reject, or strike filings that don’t comply, making the regime more resilient to misuse.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: to bring the UK registry into the digital age, raise the bar on accountability, and reduce the shadow economy of fraudulent corporate entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Risk of Doing Nothing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t a “nice to have”, non-compliance carries real consequences, potentially including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Filings may be <strong>rejected or voided</strong> if submitted by unverified individuals</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Companies &amp; officers risk <strong>penalties, annotations, or restrictions</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Where filings are invalidated, corporate actions (changes of director, share issues, etc.) could collapse</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In extreme cases, non-compliance might impact a company’s legal standing or its ability to act</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, data from Vistra suggests that <strong>only 28%</strong> of UK directors were “ready” for the reforms as of mid-2025, leaving a huge proportion exposed to last-minute scramble. <a href=\"https://www.vistra.com/insights/only-28-uk-directors-are-ready-companies-house-reforms-despite-looming-deadlines-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vistra</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Will Help You Ride the Change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we see this transition not as a burden, but as an opportunity; for stronger compliance, smoother operations, and clearer assurance. Here’s how we’ll support our clients every step of the way:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Proactive Identity Verification Assistance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll guide your directors and PSCs through the verification process, whether via GOV.UK’s One Login method or via our status as an <strong>Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP)</strong>.<br>We’ll manage the logistics, ensure proper documentation, and monitor deadlines — so no one gets left behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Registration as Your ACSP</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black &amp; White is preparing to become a registered ACSP. That means we can handle identity verification and statutory filings on your behalf, licensed by law, supervised under AML rules, and fully compliant with Companies House requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Register Review &amp; Transition Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll assess your company’s existing statutory registers and prepare for the transition to the new regime (e.g. migration or archiving of redundant registers).<br>We’ll also ensure your shareholder (member) register is correctly held and maintained in compliance with the SAIL or registered office requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Filing Controls &amp; Quality Assurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once filings can only be made by verified individuals or ACSPs, the margin for error narrows. We’ll build robust internal checks, ensure identity-verified filers carry out submissions, and guard against rejection or non-compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Training &amp; Communication</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll offer workshops, guides, and tailored advice to educate company directors, secretarial teams, and stakeholders in your organisation about what’s changing, when, and how to comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Forward Planning for 2027 Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re already preparing clients for the second wave of reforms — especially the transition to software-only filing and expanded disclosure obligations. With Black &amp; White as your partner, you won’t be scrambling, you’ll be ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Word: Don’t Wait for the Deadline</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regulatory upheaval can feel daunting, but it’s also a moment to reinforce trust, modernise your operations, and strengthen your compliance posture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>18 November 2025</strong>, identity verification becomes non-negotiable. But with foresight and partnership, like that offered by <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting, </strong>you can turn this challenge into an opportunity to shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get you ready. Let’s get you ahead.</p>\n",

But don’t worry,  with the right preparation (and the right accounting partner!), this change can be smooth, efficient, and even beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’re here to help landlords, and the estate and letting agents who support them, understand exactly what’s coming, why it matters, and how to make it work in your favour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📜 A Quick History of Making Tax Digital (MTD)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government launched the <strong>Making Tax Digital</strong> initiative back in <strong>2019</strong>, starting with VAT. The goal? To make the tax system more efficient, accurate, and easier to manage by reducing paperwork and embracing digital tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, MTD has rolled out to VAT-registered businesses and will soon extend to <strong>self-employed individuals and landlords</strong> with income over £50,000 from <strong>April 2026</strong> (and those earning over £30,000 by 2027).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, MTD is here to stay, and it’s reshaping the way individuals and businesses interact with HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 So, What Exactly <em>Is</em> MTD?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MTD means that instead of submitting one annual Self Assessment tax return, landlords will need to <strong>digitally record</strong> their property income and expenses and <strong>submit quarterly updates</strong> to HMRC through approved accounting software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means no more piles of receipts, no more last-minute scrambles in January, and fewer errors. Everything will be recorded digitally, giving landlords a clearer, more up-to-date picture of their finances year-round.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎯 The Goal of MTD &#8211; Why It’s Happening</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government’s aim with MTD is simple:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Reduce mistakes in tax reporting (currently costing HMRC billions each year).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Give taxpayers real-time visibility of their financial position and tax liability.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Streamline communication between taxpayers and HMRC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For landlords, this means <strong>less guesswork, more control</strong>, and the ability to make informed financial decisions throughout the year, not just at tax time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🏘️ What This Means for Landlords</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn more than <strong>£50,000 in annual gross property income</strong> from 2026 (or £30,000 from 2027), you’ll need to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep digital records</strong> of all property income and expenses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit quarterly updates</strong> to HMRC via MTD-compatible software.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit an end-of-period statement (EOPS)</strong> and a final declaration each year.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have multiple properties, you’ll need to record and report the details of each, and if you’re both self-employed and a landlord, you’ll need to do this for each source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds like a lot? It doesn’t have to be, not with the right systems in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧭 What Landlords Need to Do Now</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Get organised early.</strong> Start digitising your records now, so you’re not rushing in 2026.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Choose the right software.</strong> You’ll need MTD-compliant accounting software to keep records and file updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Understand your reporting requirements.</strong> We can help you determine whether you’re in the first wave (2026) or second (2027).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Talk to your accountant.</strong> The sooner you prepare, the easier it’ll be to stay compliant, and stress-free.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚙️ How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help &#8211; Every Step of the Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’re not just keeping up with MTD, we’re leading the charge.

      "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Smash Your Profits—Not Your Peace of Mind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve got a limited company, then you’ve got a date with HMRC every year. It’s called <strong>Corporation Tax</strong>—and understanding it could be the difference between <strong>smart growth</strong> and <strong>nasty surprises</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we love turning financial jargon into clear, actionable advice. So whether you’re a first-time founder or scaling up fast, this blog gives you the lowdown on what Corporation Tax is, when it applies, and how to stay ahead of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 What Is Corporation Tax?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporation Tax is a tax paid by <strong>limited companies</strong> on their <strong>taxable profits</strong>. Think of it as the business version of Income Tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Profits can come from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Trading (selling goods or services)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investments</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Asset sales (like selling property or shares)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>🧠 <strong>Sole traders don’t pay Corporation Tax</strong>—they pay Income Tax through Self Assessment. This only applies to <strong>limited companies</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💼 How Much Is Corporation Tax?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of April 2023, Corporation Tax is <strong>no longer one fixed rate</strong>. Here’s the deal:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Profit Band</strong></td><td><strong>Rate</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Up to £50,000</td><td>19% (Small Profits Rate)</td></tr><tr><td>£50,001–£250,000</td><td>Marginal Relief (a tapered rate between 19%–25%)</td></tr><tr><td>Over £250,000</td><td>25% (Main Rate)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 Tip: If your business is connected to others (e.g. part of a group), those thresholds are shared across the group!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧮 How Do You Calculate Corporation Tax?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a simplified breakdown:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start with your company’s profit</strong> (after business expenses)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjust for things HMRC doesn’t allow</strong> (e.g. client entertainment, non-business costs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apply the correct tax rate</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Subtract any reliefs, losses or allowances</strong> (more on that below)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>📍 Your Corporation Tax is based on <strong>your company’s accounting year</strong>, not the calendar year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📆 When and How Do You Pay?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Key deadlines:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax Return (CT600):</strong> Due <strong>12 months</strong> after your accounting period ends</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Corporation Tax payment:</strong> Due <strong>9 months and 1 day</strong> after your year-end\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>So if your year ends 31 March 2025, you must pay by <strong>1 January 2026</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>⚠️ There are <strong>penalties</strong> for filing late, even if you don’t owe anything. So don’t risk it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📉 Can You Reduce Your Corporation Tax Bill?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That’s where we come in 😎</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some <strong>common ways to reduce your bill</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Claiming All Allowable Expenses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From tools and travel to software subscriptions and mobile phones—<strong>if it’s wholly and exclusively for business</strong>, it could be deductible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Capital Allowances</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bought equipment, vehicles or computers? You might be able to claim <strong>100% in the year you buy it</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ R&amp;D Tax Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you developing new products, systems or software? You could claim <strong>R&amp;D tax relief</strong>, which significantly reduces your Corporation Tax—or even leads to a cash rebate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Director’s Salary &amp; Dividends</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay yourself wisely. The right mix of <strong>salary and dividends</strong> can reduce both your personal and company tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ Pension Contributions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employer pension contributions are <strong>tax-deductible</strong> and great for long-term planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We help clients build a <strong>year-round tax strategy</strong>, not just fire-fight at year-end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💻 MTD for Corporation Tax—Coming Soon!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong> for Corporation Tax is on the horizon, expected to kick in in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keeping <strong>digital records</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submitting updates via <strong>HMRC-approved software</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Possibly more frequent reporting (like VAT and income tax)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now’s the time to future-proof your business with tools like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Xero</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>QuickBooks</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>FreeAgent</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll set you up, show you how to use them—or take it all off your hands!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧠 Why This Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You work hard to grow your business. The last thing you want is to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Miss a deadline and pay a penalty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overpay because you didn’t know your allowances</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get investigated by HMRC because of a dodgy return</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart Corporation Tax planning = <strong>more profit, less stress</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We make Corporation Tax planning simple, strategic and completely tailored to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With us, you get:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>✅ Annual accounts and Corporation Tax returns done right</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Year-round advice on how to <strong>reduce your tax bill</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Guidance on <strong>salary/dividend strategy</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Access to the best cloud software (we’ll set it up)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Support with <strong>R&amp;D claims</strong>, pension planning, and more</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✅ Total peace of mind—because we handle HMRC so you don’t have to</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📢 Final Word: Get Ahead of the Tax Game</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporation Tax doesn’t have to be scary.<br>With the right advice, it can become a <strong>powerful tool</strong> to grow and protect your profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📞 <strong>Want to Pay Less Tax and Grow More Confidently?

      "content": "\n<p>At last, the moment we’ve been preparing for: HM Revenue &amp; Customs has launched full-blown promotional activity around Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax Self-Assessment (MTD for ITSA) aimed at sole traders and landlords. No more “it might happen”… it <em>is</em> happening. It just would have been nice if the message had been louder, clearer, and earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s our take at <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> of what’s going on, what you need to know, and how we’ll stand by you every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is MTD? (And what it is <em>not</em>)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ What it <em>is</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>MTD for Income Tax Self-Assessment (ITSA) means that if you’re a sole trader or a landlord (or a similar unincorporated taxpayer) with qualifying income from self-employment and/or property, you must:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep <strong>digital records</strong> of your income and expenses (using software that is recognised by HMRC).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit <strong>quarterly updates</strong> of those digital records to HMRC.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>At year-end, submit a final declaration (which links together the quarterly updates, your other income and reliefs).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s part of HMRC’s drive to modernise tax-administration (‘digital first’), reduce tax errors and reduce the tax-gap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It <em>already</em> applies to VAT-registered businesses (since April 2019).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🚫 What it <em>isn’t</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It is <em>not</em> simply an optional extra for those “who want to go digital” (for those in-scope it will be mandatory).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is <em>not</em> limited to paper plus spreadsheets. If you rely solely on manual spreadsheets without a digital link or compatible software, you’ll likely fall short.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is <em>not</em> (for now) being mandated for all taxpayers or all business types (limited companies or partnerships might have different rules).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is <em>not</em> only an end-of-year change. Quarter-by-quarter submissions mean tax-affairs are gradually monitored rather than just once a year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is impacted?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a sole trader or landlord, you should check carefully whether you fall into the scope. Key points:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The threshold for ‘qualifying income’ is based on <strong>gross income</strong> from self-employment <em>and</em> property (before expenses and tax) for the relevant prior tax year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rollout is in phases:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>From <strong>6 April 2026</strong>: those with qualifying income > <strong>£50,000</strong> will be required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From <strong>6 April 2027</strong>: those with qualifying income > <strong>£30,000</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From <strong>6 April 2028</strong>: those with qualifying income > <strong>£20,000</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Examples: If you’re a sole trader making £55,000 self-employment income in 2024–25, you’ll likely be in-scope from April 2026. If you earn say £25,000 income (property + self-employment) you might not be mandated until April 2028.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some income does <em>not</em> count towards the threshold (for example, PAYE employment income, dividends, etc).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exemptions and deferrals may apply (if you are digitally excluded for reasons of age, disability, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What it will <em>mean</em> for you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how your day-to-day will change, and why you shouldn’t wait until the last minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔ Benefits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’ll have <strong>real-time visibility</strong> of your income, expenses and likely tax bill. The new digital tools bring better cash-flow planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You reduce the risk of large year-end surprises (big tax bill, missing receipts, scrambling).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your record-keeping becomes cleaner, more systematic &#8211; less “shoe-box of receipts” style. That’s good for your peace of mind and good for your accountant.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You and your accountant can integrate software, bank feeds, expense capture and make the process smoother.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>⚠ Challenges &amp; what to watch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’ll need to adopt <strong>compatible digital software</strong> now (or imminently) and make sure workflows are set up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll have to submit quarterly updates (so more frequent but lighter burden – still needs discipline).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Because the system is more “live” there is less room for leaving everything to the end of the year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Penalties will apply if you miss deadlines (and get too many points).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you rely on traditional spreadsheets or paper, you may need bridging software or to move fully to a cloud system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📅 Timeline you must keep top of mind</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>By 6 April 2026: If you are over the threshold you must have software, digital record-keeping, and be ready to submit your first quarterly update.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7 August 2026: Deadline for first quarterly update for someone falling into 2026 start.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 2027 onwards: More taxpayers with lower thresholds will join. So even if you’re “below now”, you’ll want to prepare ahead.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s essential to begin preparation now, not wait until the year or two before your start date.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HMRC’s Communication Plan: Who, What, How, When</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the adverts are <em>here</em>.

If you’re using spreadsheets alone you’ll likely need bridging software or a move.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Digital link</strong>: If you use more than one piece of software (e.g., sales system + spreadsheet) you’ll need to ensure data flows digitally (not manual copy-paste) to meet the “digital links” requirement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Split incomes</strong>: If you have both self-employment and property income, both count for threshold checks and you will send separate quarterly updates for each income stream under some regimes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business bank account or clean records</strong>: Particularly for landlords, mixing personal and business transactions can complicate the digital record-keeping requirements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prepare early = less stress</strong>: Even if you’re not yet mandated (because your income’s below the threshold now) getting systems in place ahead of time means you’ll be ready when the deadline hits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Penalties</strong>: The old system of late-return penalties will morph into a “points-based” scheme (for some aspects) under MTD for ITSA.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Exemptions apply</strong>: If you are digitally excluded for legitimate reasons (age, disability, location, religion) you may apply for an exemption &#8211; so check if this applies to you.

But every year, the same question rears its head:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Should I take a <strong>salary</strong>, a <strong>dividend</strong>, or a mix of both?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, the answer matters more than ever—because recent changes to <strong>Corporation Tax rates, dividend allowances, and National Insurance thresholds</strong> mean <strong>your old strategy may no longer be your best one</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting Limited</strong>, we help ambitious directors squeeze every drop of value from their company <strong>without stepping into a tax trap</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s unpack the salary vs dividend decision in 2025—and help you take home more, the smart way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 The Basics: How Salary and Dividends Work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Salary</strong> is paid via PAYE, like any employee. It’s:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A deductible expense for your company (reduces profit and Corporation Tax)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subject to Income Tax <strong>and</strong> National Insurance (NI)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can help qualify for state pension and mortgage applications</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dividends</strong> are paid out of post-tax profits. They’re:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Not deductible</strong> for Corporation Tax</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Taxed personally at lower rates than salary</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Not subject to NI</strong> (that’s a win!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Only payable if the company has distributable profits</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have pros and cons. But <strong>2025 has shaken up the numbers</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📈 2025 Tax Update Recap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what’s changed—and what’s hurting directors the most:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🚨 Corporation Tax Bands (since April 2023)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Up to £50,000 profit → 19%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Over £250,000 profit → 25%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Between = <strong>tapered marginal relief</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>👉 This makes <strong>salary more valuable</strong> as a deduction for companies over £50k profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🚨 Dividend Allowance Shrunk (Again)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2022/23: £2,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023/24: £1,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2024/25: £500</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep—just <strong>£500</strong> is now tax-free. Everything above that gets taxed at:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>8.75% (basic rate)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>33.75% (higher rate)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>39.35% (additional rate)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>💥 This makes large dividend strategies less tax-friendly—especially for high earners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧮 The Numbers: 2025 Salary vs Dividend Comparison</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say your company has <strong>£50,000 in profits to pay you</strong>, and you’re the sole shareholder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scenario A: All Dividends</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Corporation Tax (19%) = £9,500</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Remaining = £40,500</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividend tax (basic rate) = ~£3,500</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Take-home</strong> = ~£37,000</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scenario B: Salary up to £12,570 + Dividends</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Salary is tax-free (within personal allowance)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Company saves ~£2,400 in Corporation Tax (on the salary deduction)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividends from remaining profits = ~£37,000</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dividend tax = lower because of reduced profit</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Take-home</strong> = <strong>~£38,500</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 In 2025, <strong>blending salary + dividends is more tax-efficient</strong> than pure dividends for most director/shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ When to Lean Into Salary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to increase salary if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’re near the <strong>Corporation Tax taper zone</strong> (£50k–£250k)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to <strong>build up qualifying income</strong> for state pension or borrowing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You have little to no other income (and can use personal allowance tax-free)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to make <strong>larger pension contributions</strong>—these are salary-linked</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus: Salary counts as <strong>earned income</strong>, which helps with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Mortgage applications</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personal pension relief</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Child benefit thresholds</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ When Dividends Still Work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dividends still shine if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You want <strong>simplicity and flexibility</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ve already hit your National Insurance thresholds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You want to <strong>avoid employer NI contributions</strong> (currently 13.8%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You have <strong>multiple shareholders</strong> (can vary dividends easily)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Just keep an eye on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Available post-tax profits</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dividend documentation</strong> (minutes + vouchers)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>PAYE vs dividend balance</strong>, especially if you receive other income</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚠️ The Danger Zone: Taking Too Much as Dividends</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve seen directors get caught out by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Taking dividends when there’s no profit</strong> (illegal, and red-flagged by HMRC)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Using dividends to repay overdrawn directors’ loans</strong> without paperwork</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Assuming dividends are always cheaper</strong>—they’re not, post-2025 changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>📉 A poor drawdown strategy = personal tax shock + Section 455 charge + missed opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤖 What About MTD Software?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using software like <strong>Xero, QuickBooks, Sage or FreeAgent</strong> lets us:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Track real-time profits (so you know what’s available for dividends)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run simulations of different extraction strategies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create payslips and dividend vouchers instantly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make quarterly planning part of your routine—not just a year-end panic</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How Black &amp; White Accounting Helps You Win</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t just file tax returns—we plan your <strong>director wealth strategy</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>📊 A personalised salary/dividend split plan</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🧮 Real-time profit tracking via cloud software</li>\n\n\n\n<li>💬 Ongoing advice when profits rise (or drop)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>🧾 Proper documentation to stay HMRC-safe</li>\n\n\n\n<li>💡 Year-end reviews to optimise extraction before deadlines hit</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes—we help you adjust your strategy every year as tax laws change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 Final Word: Don&#8217;t Let Outdated Advice Cost You in 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The dividend-only model worked in 2018.<br>In 2025?

      "content": "\n<p>Selling a property can be exciting, but when you’re not living in it, the tax implications can quickly take the shine off your profit. Enter <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</strong>: a crucial part of property ownership that every landlord, investor, and second-home owner needs to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re an estate or letting agent helping clients navigate a sale, or a landlord planning ahead, here’s everything you need to know, and how <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> can help you manage it smoothly, efficiently, and without any nasty surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💰 What Is Capital Gains Tax (CGT)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong> is a tax you pay on the profit (the “gain”) when you sell or dispose of an asset that’s increased in value, including property that isn’t your main home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t pay CGT on the full sale price, only on the <strong>gain</strong>, the difference between what you paid for the property and what you sell it for, after deducting allowable costs like stamp duty, legal fees, and estate agent commissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<br>If you bought a flat for <strong>£200,000</strong>, spent <strong>£5,000</strong> on buying costs and <strong>£10,000</strong> improving it, and later sold it for <strong>£300,000</strong>, your taxable gain would be <strong>£85,000</strong> (£300,000 – £200,000 – £5,000 – £10,000).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧮 How to Calculate the Capital Gain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculating your gain isn’t just about the headline figures, it’s about getting the details right. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sale price</strong> (or market value if given away)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Minus the purchase price</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Minus allowable costs</strong> (such as legal fees, stamp duty, estate agent fees, and capital improvements, but not repairs or maintenance)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Minus your annual CGT allowance</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For the 2025/26 tax year, the <strong>annual CGT exemption</strong> is <strong>£3,000</strong> per individual, meaning you only pay tax on gains above that amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📈 Current CGT Rates on Property</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CGT rates depend on your overall income:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>18%</strong> for <strong>basic rate taxpayers</strong> (on the portion of the gain within the basic rate band)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>24%</strong> for <strong>higher and additional rate taxpayers</strong> (since the reduction from 28% announced in 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These rates apply specifically to <strong>residential property gains</strong>. For other assets, the rates may differ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you jointly own a property, each owner calculates their gain and applies their own CGT allowance and tax rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📈 Current CGT Rates on Property</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CGT rates depend on your overall income:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>18%</strong> for <strong>basic rate taxpayers</strong> (on the portion of the gain within the basic rate band)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>24%</strong> for <strong>higher and additional rate taxpayers</strong> (since the reduction from 28% announced in 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These rates apply specifically to <strong>residential property gains</strong> for <strong>individuals</strong>. For other assets, the rates may differ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you jointly own a property, each owner calculates their gain and applies their own CGT allowance and tax rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💼 <strong>If the property is owned through a limited company</strong>, the rules are different, companies don’t pay Capital Gains Tax. Instead, they pay <strong>Corporation Tax</strong> on the gain, currently at <strong>25%</strong> (or the applicable small profits rate if the company qualifies). This can sometimes make company ownership more tax-efficient, but it depends on your broader financial situation and how profits are extracted from the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🏠 Reliefs That Can Reduce or Eliminate CGT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several <strong>reliefs</strong> that can reduce how much CGT you owe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Private Residence Relief (PRR):</strong> If the property was your main home at any point, part of the gain may be exempt.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lettings Relief:</strong> May apply in limited cases if you once lived in the property and later let it out.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spousal Transfers:</strong> Assets can be transferred between spouses or civil partners tax-free, which can help use both annual exemptions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules can get complex, especially for landlords who’ve lived in the property, made improvements, or own jointly. That’s where professional advice makes all the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⏱️ The 60-Day Reporting Rule (and How We Got Here)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since <strong>April 2020</strong>, UK residents who sell a residential property that triggers CGT have been required to <strong>report and pay the tax to HMRC within a short window</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, this was just <strong>30 days, </strong>a deadline that caught many people out. But after widespread feedback from taxpayers and professionals, HMRC extended the window to <strong>60 days</strong> in <strong>October 2021</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that <strong>within 60 days of completion</strong>, you must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Report the sale</strong> via HMRC’s online “UK Property Return” service, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pay any CGT due</strong> based on your best estimate at the time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll still need to include the gain in your annual Self Assessment, but this separate 60-day return is <strong>mandatory, </strong>and penalties apply for late filing or payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚙️ Why This Rule Exists</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 60-day rule was introduced to <strong>speed up CGT collection</strong> and <strong>reduce underpayment risk</strong>. Previously, CGT on property sales could be declared more than a year after completion, now, HMRC gets the tax in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is to improve compliance and make sure everyone pays the right tax at the right time, though it does add an extra administrative step for property owners and agents to manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧭 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we make sure your clients, and you, never have to stress about CGT deadlines or complex calculations.

With different options available, from holding properties in your own name to forming partnerships or companies, the right choice can shape your cash flow, tax position, and growth potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help landlords and investors find the most tax-efficient structure for their portfolios and plan for the future with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 The Main Structures for Property Ownership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but understanding the key options is the first step to making an informed decision. Let’s break them down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>👤 1. Sole Trader (Individual Ownership)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the most common and straightforward structure, especially for first-time landlords. You personally own the property, receive the income, and pay tax on your profits through Self Assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Simple to set up and manage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No separate company accounts or filings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to personal tax allowances and reliefs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Income is taxed at your personal rate, which could be up to 45%.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limited ability to deduct mortgage interest for residential lets.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No protection if something goes wrong, as you and the property are legally the same entity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Best suited for: smaller landlords with modest rental income or those testing the waters of property investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>👥 2. Partnership</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A partnership allows two or more people to own property together, sharing income, expenses, and responsibilities. Each partner is taxed individually on their share of the profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Flexible profit-sharing arrangements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easy to add or remove partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some flexibility in transferring interests between partners.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Partners are personally liable for debts and taxes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Still subject to the same mortgage interest restrictions as sole traders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can become complex if one partner wants to exit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Best suited for: families or business partners managing multiple properties together with shared goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🏢 3. Limited Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owning property through a limited company has become increasingly popular, especially for higher-rate taxpayers and those building larger portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Profits are taxed at the <strong>Corporation Tax rate of 25%</strong>, not personal income tax rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full mortgage interest can usually be deducted as an expense.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Greater control over reinvestment and long-term planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limited liability protection for directors and shareholders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>More administrative work and annual filing requirements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mortgage options can be more limited and sometimes more expensive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you take profits out personally, further tax may apply through dividends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Best suited for: investors building a property business or planning long-term growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>⚖️ 4. Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An <strong>LLP</strong> blends elements of a traditional partnership with some of the legal protections of a company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Partners’ liability is limited to what they invest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offers flexibility in profit allocation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can help with succession planning or complex ownership structures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Still taxed personally on profits, not at Corporation Tax rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More administrative work than a standard partnership.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not always suitable for smaller portfolios.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Best suited for: professional investors or family groups managing significant property assets who value flexibility and legal protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔄 Converting Your Portfolio into a Limited Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many landlords who started as individuals or partnerships are now choosing to <strong>incorporate</strong> their property business to benefit from lower Corporation Tax rates and full interest deductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to transfer your portfolio into a company, but it must be done carefully to avoid unexpected tax charges. HMRC may view the transfer as a sale, potentially triggering <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</strong> and <strong>Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, reliefs can sometimes apply, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Incorporation Relief</strong> for CGT, if you run a genuine property business with multiple properties and active management.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SDLT Partnership Relief</strong>, if structured correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we assess your individual circumstances, model the financial impact, and manage the process end-to-end to ensure it’s done efficiently and compliantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💼 Other Useful Considerations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When deciding how to structure property ownership, it’s important to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Long-term goals</strong> – short-term tax savings might not always align with future plans.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Exit strategy</strong> – how you plan to sell, pass on, or refinance your properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Financing</strong> – lenders often have different criteria for companies versus individuals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inheritance planning</strong> – some structures make it easier to transfer wealth efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Good tax planning doesn’t just reduce your bill; it also gives you more flexibility, security, and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧭 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping landlords and property investors structure, grow, and manage their portfolios tax efficiently.

      "content": "\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we pride ourselves on staying ahead of the curve so that <strong>you</strong> don’t have to. With the announcement from HMRC that applications are now open for exemptions on the grounds of <em>digital exclusion</em>, now is the time for sole traders and landlords to act, seek clarity, and if necessary, secure their exemption from MTD IT. Here’s a full breakdown of what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📣 Big news: Exemption applications now open</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC has recently confirmed that individuals who believe they’re <strong>digitally excluded</strong> can now apply for an exemption from MTD for Income Tax. In summary:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>From 6 April 2026, individuals with <em>qualifying income</em> (self-employment or property) over <strong>£50,000</strong> will have to use MTD for Income Tax.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 6 April 2027, the threshold drops to <strong>£30,000</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 6 April 2028, it will be <strong>£20,000</strong> (for the 2026-27 year) as law is extended.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>But if you can demonstrate <em>digital exclusion</em>, you <strong>may</strong> be exempt from using the MTD digital system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re reading this and thinking: “Am I going to have to switch to digital reporting next year?”; the answer is likely yes, unless an exemption applies to you. And that’s where we step in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">✅ What kinds of scenarios will HMRC accept for exemption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC defines “digitally excluded” as cases where <strong>“it’s not reasonably practicable”</strong> to use compatible software and keep digital records. Examples cited include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A taxpayer’s <strong>age</strong>, health condition or disability means they cannot use a computer/tablet/smartphone/software.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The taxpayer lives in a location where <strong>internet access is unavailable or unsuitable</strong>, and no suitable alternative location is reasonably accessible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A practising member of a <strong>religious society or order</strong> whose beliefs are incompatible with using electronic communications or keeping electronic records.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly: HMRC says that the taxpayer must show how their <strong>personal circumstances</strong> make digital compliance <em>not reasonably practicable</em>, not just inconvenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚫 What situations HMRC will not accept</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being clear about these will help you decide whether an exemption application is credible, and how we at Black &amp; White Accounting can help you build that case:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC guidance states that the following <em>alone</em> will <strong>not</strong> qualify for exemption:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Simply because you have <strong>always filed a paper tax return</strong> in the past.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You are <strong>unfamiliar with accountancy software</strong> &#8211; because unfamiliarity alone does not make digital reporting &#8220;not reasonably practicable&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You only have a <strong>small number of digital records</strong> to create each year.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will cost <strong>extra time or extra money</strong> for you to sign up for and use MTD-software (unless that cost is combined with other factors like disability, remoteness, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: HMRC expects you to make a strong case. If you simply dislike or find digital systems inconvenient, you won’t likely qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 How to apply to be exempt &#8211; and how we help you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the application process, step by step &#8211; and where Black &amp; White Accounting can take the lead to support you all the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Check whether you need to use MTD for Income Tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Work out if you’re within the thresholds (over £50,000 from April 2026, £30,000 from April 2027, £20,000 from April 2028) for self-employment/property income.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re below the threshold, you aren’t yet mandated,  but you may <strong>opt in</strong> early.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you are above, then prepare to join MTD unless you secure a valid exemption.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Black &amp; White helps:</strong> We’ll review your income streams and projections, confirm your threshold status, and advise whether you’re in scope and therefore likely to need either to comply or to consider an exemption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Decide if you have genuine grounds for “digital exclusion”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Review whether any of your personal circumstances match HMRC’s examples: health/disability, poor internet access or geographical remoteness, religious beliefs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gather evidence: perhaps a statement of access issues, medical reports, religious society membership, or combinations thereof.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How we help:</strong> We’ll assist you in assessing your circumstances against HMRC’s criteria, pull together supporting documentation, and formulate the narrative why MTD is not reasonably practicable for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Submit the application to HMRC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The application must be made <strong>before</strong> you are required to use MTD. HMRC aims to respond within <strong>28 days</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Application can be made by phone or writing to HMRC (Self Assessment general enquiries). The letter should be headed: <em>“Making Tax Digital for Income Tax &#8211; digitally excluded application”</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll need to provide: your National Insurance number, name, address; how you currently submit your tax return; whether you use an agent (and what they do); your reasons and supporting information; details of any additional needs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How we help:</strong> We will draft or review the letter/application, ensure all details are accurate, liaise with HMRC (if authorised) and monitor the process so you don’t miss deadlines or required follow-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: After applying – what happens next?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>HMRC will issue a decision letter. If approved, you may continue submitting Self Assessment returns (paper or non-MTD digital) instead of joining the quarterly MTD updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If HMRC rejects, you have <strong>30 days</strong> from the date on the letter to appeal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Even while you wait for HMRC’s response, you should still <em>prepare</em> as though you may have to join MTD, keeping your records up to date and software ready.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your circumstances change (for instance, your disability improves or internet access becomes available) you must notify HMRC, because your exemption may no longer apply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How we help:</strong> We’ll keep you on track with deadlines, manage your record-keeping whether you’re joining MTD or awaiting an exemption decision, and assist with the appeal if required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🌟 Why choose Black &amp; White Accounting as your partner</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We’re a fast-growing firm with a dynamic approach: we bring the latest regulatory updates (such as this MTD IT exemption) to our clients <strong>proactively</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We specialise in helping small business owners, sole traders and landlords &#8211; the very groups most impacted by MTD IT.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We take the hassle off your plate: from eligibility assessments and income-threshold reviews, to compiling supporting evidence, drafting the exemption application, liaising with HMRC, and preparing you for either scenario (compliance or exemption).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether you <em>apply for exemption</em> or <em>move into full MTD-compliance</em>, we provide ongoing support so you’re never left navigating unfamiliar software or new processes alone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We believe in clarity, responsiveness and practical advice: no frightening jargon, just a clear path forward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 Final thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rollout of MTD for Income Tax is one of the biggest shifts in UK tax-admin for sole traders and landlords in many years. Being prepared matters. While the introduction of digital-recording and quarterly updates is the norm for most, the availability of <strong>exemption</strong> on grounds of digital exclusion gives a crucial lifeline for those whose circumstances genuinely make the digital route impractical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you might qualify for the exemption, or even if you’re unsure and want reassurance, now is the time to act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we’re ready to help you every step of the way: from checking whether you’re in scope, reviewing your circumstances for digital exclusion, to applying for exemption or guiding you seamlessly into MTD-compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>👉 <strong>Get in touch</strong> with us today, and let’s make sure your tax-journey is as smooth and stress-free as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s turn the unknown into “done and dusted”.</strong></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Being a landlord can be incredibly rewarding, but it also comes with a maze of tax rules that can trip up even the most experienced investors. From allowable expenses and recordkeeping to choosing the right ownership structure, smart tax planning can make the difference between a good return and a great one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we work with landlords, property investors, and agents every day to make sure they’re not paying a penny more in tax than they should, while keeping their property business fully compliant and future-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are our <strong>top tax tips for landlords</strong> to help you keep more of what you earn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 1. Claim Every Allowable Expense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The golden rule: if an expense is <strong>wholly and exclusively</strong> for the purpose of renting out your property, it’s probably deductible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Typical allowable expenses include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Letting agent fees and management costs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Accountancy and legal fees related to rental activity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Property repairs and maintenance (but not improvements)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Buildings and contents insurance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Utilities, council tax, and ground rent (if paid by you)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cleaning, gardening, and general upkeep</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel costs for property management or inspections</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not allowable:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Improvements that increase the property’s value (these may count toward Capital Gains Tax relief later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your own time or labour</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personal costs or anything not directly linked to the rental</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep detailed records and receipts; small costs add up fast, and missing them means missing out on savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🏗️ 2. Get the Ownership Structure Right</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How you own your properties can significantly affect how much tax you pay. Whether you’re starting out or expanding your portfolio, choosing the right structure is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sole Trader (Individual Ownership)</strong><br>Simple to manage and ideal for smaller landlords, but profits are taxed at your personal income tax rate, and mortgage interest relief is restricted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Partnership</strong><br>Flexible profit sharing, useful for families or couples, but still taxed personally on each partner’s share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limited Company</strong><br>Profits are taxed at the <strong>Corporation Tax rate of 25%</strong>, and full mortgage interest relief is available. However, extracting profits through dividends can add further tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong><br>A hybrid option offering partnership flexibility with some legal protection, best for more complex or professional setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>More on this can be found in our blog here [week 3 blog link].</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The right structure depends on your income, future goals, and portfolio size. Getting this wrong can be costly, but the right advice can unlock big long-term savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧾 3. Keep Great Records &#8211; It Pays Off</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good recordkeeping isn’t just about compliance, it’s about control. Clear, up-to-date records make it easier to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Track profits and losses accurately</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claim every deduction you’re entitled to</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prepare for future tax changes (like MTD)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make strategic decisions based on real-time data</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Paper receipts and spreadsheets are becoming a thing of the past. Using a <strong>cloud-based accounting platform</strong> such as Xero, QuickBooks, or FreeAgent keeps everything organised and accessible, and it will soon be a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💻 4. Get Ready for Making Tax Digital (MTD)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next phase of <strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD)</strong> is coming in <strong>April 2026</strong>, and it will affect landlords with property income over £50,000 (and those earning over £30,000 by 2027).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of one annual Self Assessment, landlords will need to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep <strong>digital records</strong> of all income and expenses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit <strong>quarterly updates</strong> to HMRC via approved software</li>\n\n\n\n<li>File a <strong>final annual declaration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting set up early means you’ll avoid stress later, and you’ll gain better insight into your property finances throughout the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>More on this can be found in our blog here [https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/mtd-for-landlords-2026-and-beyond-everything-you-need-to-know/].</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💷 5. Don’t Forget About Capital Allowances and Reliefs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you let out <strong>furnished holiday properties</strong>, you may be able to claim <strong>Capital Allowances</strong> on items such as furniture, fixtures, and fittings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other valuable reliefs include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Private Residence Relief (PRR)</strong> if you’ve lived in the property at any point</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lettings Relief</strong> (limited cases)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Replacement of Domestic Items Relief</strong> for replacing furniture and appliances in residential lets</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Knowing which reliefs apply, and when, can shave thousands off your tax bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📆 6. Plan Ahead to Minimise Your Tax Burden</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategic planning is key. Consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Timing property sales</strong> to make use of your annual CGT allowance (£3,000 per person in 2025/26)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Splitting ownership</strong> with a spouse or civil partner to use both allowances</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reinvesting profits</strong> to reduce immediate tax liabilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reviewing mortgage arrangements</strong> under different ownership structures</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The earlier you plan, the more flexibility you’ll have to reduce your tax exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚙️ How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we specialise in helping landlords and property investors stay compliant, tax-efficient, and stress-free.

      "content": "\n<p>The calendar is ticking towards the Autumn Budget 2025, and for landlords and property investors, it feels like the calm before a storm. While nothing is confirmed yet, several credible rumours are circulating that could significantly impact rental income, property portfolios, and tax liabilities. This is your chance, both as an estate/letting agent and for your landlord clients, to get ahead, plan smart, and ensure you’re not caught off-guard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting we’re already working with agents and landlords to assess potential scenarios, model their impact, and prepare strategies. Let’s walk through what <em>might</em> be coming &#8211; note that what follows are only <strong>possible</strong> changes, not guarantees &#8211; and talk about how to prepare.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔍 Key Rumoured Changes for Landlords &amp; Property Owners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most frequently discussed possibilities ahead of the 2025 Budget:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>An 8% National Insurance</strong><strong>‐style levy on rental income</strong>: There’s speculation that the Treasury is considering applying National Insurance (NI) contributions to rental income for the first time (currently rental income is not subject to NI).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Replacement or overhaul of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)</strong>: One idea floated is an annual property tax or a restructured form of SDLT, possibly spreading payments or changing rates for investment properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Further changes to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on property disposals</strong>: Speculation includes cuts to allowances, higher rates, or extending CGT to main homes in certain scenarios.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Freezing or adjusting income tax thresholds and reliefs</strong>: Though not specific only to landlords, freezing thresholds means higher tax burdens even without rate increases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher taxation or levies on high-value property portfolios or second homes</strong>: Reports suggest that properties above certain values may face extra charges or be targeted for new taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📌 Why Agents and Landlords Should Care</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Planning ahead is a differentiator</strong>: As an estate or letting agent, you add value to your service when you help clients anticipate tax change risk rather than react to it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Portfolio decisions may need to be accelerated</strong>: If changes like CGT cuts or new levies are confirmed, clients might decide to buy, sell, or restructure now rather than later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Structure and ownership matter</strong>: Different ownership structures (personal ownership, limited company, partnerships) will bear tax changes differently. Knowing how potential changes affect each structure is key.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cash-flow and compliance will be pressured</strong>: With new taxes or levies, landlords may face higher costs, stricter reporting, or debugging of outdated structures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🔧 How to Prepare &#8211; Practical Steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some actions agents can encourage their landlord clients to take now, so they’re not scrambling when the Budget hits:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review current portfolio structure</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Look at how properties are held (sole name, partnership, company) and what tax implications each has under potential changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Model what an NI levy on rental income or CGT cut would do in your client’s case.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Update ownership and financing strategy</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If clients are considering switching to a limited company structure, it may be worth starting discussions now.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check mortgage terms, lender covenants and tax cost of transfer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintain impeccable records and cash-flow forecasts</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Good record-keeping makes it easier to spot how new rules might impact returns.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consider stress-testing portfolios with higher tax burdens or new levy scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax &amp; portfolio review meeting</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Schedule a strategic review with an accountant or tax adviser to consider options before the Budget is announced.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Watch for rumours and announcements &#8211; being ready means being able to act quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on timing</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you suspect a CGT allowance cut or new levy, timing of sales, ownership changes or acquisitions could matter.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plan for different tax environments and ensure you’re ready for change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🤝 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help You &amp; Your Clients</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting we specialise in property tax and investment structuring. Here’s how we partner with estate and letting agents and their clients to navigate this uncertain terrain:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pre-Budget scenario modelling</strong>: We run different tax change scenarios (NI levy, CGT changes, SDLT reform) so landlords can see the potential impact on their business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ownership structure review</strong>: We advise whether personal, partnership or limited company ownership continues to make sense under possible new rules.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax planning &amp; compliance support</strong>: We ensure clients are set up with the right reporting systems, anticipate changes, and avoid last minute surprises.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Supporting agents and their landlord clients</strong>: We provide white-label materials, webinars or guidance you can share with your clients to add value to your service.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing monitoring and agility</strong>: Once the Budget is announced, we help clients respond quickly &#8211; whether that means restructuring, re-financing, sale planning or adjusting strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 Final Thoughts &#8211; Act Now, Don’t Wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key message? <strong>Don’t wait for the Budget to land</strong> before doing something. Rumours may yet change, but the early signals suggest significant tax pressure for landlords and property owners. By preparing now &#8211; reviewing structure, modelling outcomes, getting records in order &#8211; you position yourself and your clients to act, not react.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an estate or letting agent, partnering with Black &amp; White Accounting means you are offering your clients more than just a property service &#8211; you’re supporting their financial strategy, growth and resilience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>📩 Get in touch with us today and let’s build a pre-Budget readiness plan for you and your landlord clients &#8211; so you’re ready whatever the Chancellor announces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK business landscape is evolving rapidly, and so are the costs of running a company. From <strong>1 February 2026</strong>, Companies House will introduce a significant overhaul of its fees. Whether you’re an existing client or a business exploring your options, Black &amp; White Accounting is here to help you understand these changes and stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s Changing? – The Key Fee Increases</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the most commonly used Companies House services will become more expensive. Here are some of the headline changes:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Service</strong></td><td><strong>Current Fee</strong></td><td><strong>New Fee (from 1 Feb 2026)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Digital incorporation</strong></td><td>£50</td><td><strong>£100</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Paper incorporation</strong></td><td>£71</td><td><strong>£124</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Same-day digital incorporation</strong></td><td>£78</td><td><strong>£156</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Confirmation Statement (digital)</strong></td><td>£34</td><td><strong>£50</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Confirmation Statement (paper)</strong></td><td>£62</td><td><strong>£110</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voluntary Strike-Off (digital)</strong></td><td>£33</td><td><strong>£13</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voluntary Strike-Off (paper)</strong></td><td>£44</td><td><strong>£18</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While most fees are rising sharply, the cost to close a company is actually <strong>decreasing</strong>, see more below. Please note these are the statutory fees charged by Companies House for their services. If you use an accountant or formation agent to handle these filings on your behalf, their professional service fees will be higher, as they include the time, expertise, and administrative work involved in preparing and submitting the documents correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Are Fees Increasing?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These increases are part of broader reforms brought in under recent UK legislation aimed at improving transparency and tackling economic crime. The changes are designed to:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Strengthen Identity Verification</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>New rules require directors, people with significant control, and others associated with a company to verify their identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Improve Data Accuracy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House is being given enhanced powers to query, investigate, and remove inaccurate or suspicious information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Modernise Systems and Infrastructure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgraded digital systems, compliance tools, and security measures come with ongoing costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Support Enforcement Work</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the funding will support investigations into fraudulent activity, the disqualification of directors, and the winding-up of non-compliant or abusive companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Ensure Cost Recovery</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies House operates on a cost-recovery basis, meaning fees are being increased to match the higher operational demands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for Businesses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Higher Costs for Starting a Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs and start-ups will face higher initial costs due to the doubling of digital incorporation fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Increased Ongoing Compliance Costs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annual confirmation statement will be more expensive, which businesses need to factor into their budgeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Push Toward Digital Filing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While fees have risen across the board, digital services remain cheaper than their paper counterparts, encouraging more efficient online filing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Scrutiny and Compliance Obligations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Companies House now checking information more carefully, businesses need to ensure accuracy and timeliness in their filings. Mistakes or omissions could bring delays or further queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Potential Decline in Shell Companies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher incorporation fees may discourage frivolous company formations, contributing to a more trustworthy register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Closing a Company Is Becoming Cheaper</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One unexpected twist in the changes is that <strong>voluntary strike-off</strong> &#8211; the process of closing a limited company, will become significantly cheaper for digital filings:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>From <strong>£33 down to £13</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This reduction is likely intended to help remove dormant, inactive, or non-compliant companies from the register, strengthening overall data quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For business owners with dormant or unused companies, this could be a smart time to consider whether keeping the entity active is worth the continuing compliance costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other Useful Things to Know</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Timing matters:</strong> If you’re planning to incorporate soon, you may wish to do so before February 2026.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Budgeting is key:</strong> Businesses should factor higher filing fees into their forecasting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dormant businesses should review their position:</strong> With confirmation statement fees rising and strike-off getting cheaper, some companies may now be worth closing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Expect more verification requirements:</strong> Identity checks and documentation requirements will become more stringent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help You Navigate These Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, our mission is to help businesses grow with confidence, even when the rules are changing. Here’s how we can support you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔ Strategic Incorporation Advice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering forming a company, we can help you plan the timing, structure, and paperwork to minimise cost and maximise efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔ Complete Compliance Management</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We take care of your statutory filings &#8211; confirmation statements, annual accounts, and more, ensuring accuracy and timeliness so you avoid complications or penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔ Guidance on Closing Companies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about striking off a dormant or redundant entity? We’ll walk you through the process, compare your options, and prepare everything you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔ Risk Reduction and Governance Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With tighter Companies House scrutiny, good governance is essential. We help ensure your records, filings, and company information are compliant and reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔ Future-Focused Strategic Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Companies House reforms are only one part of a wider shift in UK corporate regulation. We help you stay ready, not reactive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fees are rising dramatically</strong> from February 2026, particularly for incorporation and annual filings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The changes are designed to improve transparency, reduce fraud, and modernise Companies House systems.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Closing a company will become significantly cheaper</strong>, especially for digital strike-offs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Businesses should prepare now</strong>, reviewing their structures, budgeting for higher costs, and ensuring compliance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Black &amp; White Accounting is here to help you adapt confidently and strategically.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The 2025 Budget landed with a thud; and not just because it’s a big one. In a rare bit of Budget-day drama, the <strong>OBR accidentally released its Economic &amp; Fiscal Outlook early</strong>, meaning half of Westminster seemed to know the numbers before the Chancellor even stood up. A “technical error”, they said. Cue frantic refreshing of news feeds…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beyond the chaos, this was a Budget delivered against a tough backdrop: <strong>slow but stable growth</strong>, <strong>high borrowing</strong>, households still feeling the squeeze, and the Treasury sticking firmly to the line that <strong>big headline tax cuts are simply not on the table</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, this is a Budget of <strong>quiet but significant shifts</strong> &#8211; especially on the taxation of <strong>property</strong>, <strong>savings</strong>, <strong>dividends</strong>, and <strong>pensions</strong>. A lot of people won’t see immediate changes today, but the cumulative effect is meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the key things you need to know now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Big Picture – What kind of Budget was this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of this Budget as less “rabbit out of the hat” and more “slow tightening of the belt”.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No changes to income tax, NI or VAT rates</strong>, but thresholds are <strong>frozen for longer</strong>, pulling more people into higher bands over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investment income</strong> &#8211; from <em>property</em>, <em>savings</em> and <em>dividends, </em>becomes noticeably less tax-advantaged over the next few years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Targeted wealth taxes</strong> are introduced, including a <strong>mansion-tax style surcharge</strong> for homes over £2m.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support is directed towards <strong>families</strong>, <strong>pensioners</strong>, and <strong>everyday energy costs</strong>, while still trying to meet tight fiscal rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn’t a “wow” speech, but the fine print really matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Takeaways – Quick Headlines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A. Personal tax</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No change to the main tax rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Income tax thresholds stay frozen until the end of the decade, quietly increasing tax bills as wages rise.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 2029, <strong>large pension salary sacrifice arrangements</strong> will lose much of their NI advantage (anything above £2,000 per year will attract NI).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B. Investment income taxes are going up</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>New rises &#8211; phased in from 2026 to 2027 will hit:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Dividend income</strong> (up 2 percentage points for basic and higher-rate taxpayers).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings interest</strong> (also up 2 percentage points).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rental property income</strong> (new higher rates of 22%, 42% and 47%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people with modest savings are unaffected, but <strong>company directors, landlords and investors</strong> need to take note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C.

      "content": "\n<p><strong><em>Your detailed guide to the Autumn Budget 2025 and what it means for you</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <strong>26 November 2025</strong>, Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered a Budget packed with significant tax changes, big structural reforms, and a strong emphasis on rebuilding public services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It arrived following an extraordinary moment: the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts were <strong>accidentally published early</strong>, creating a rare Budget-day scramble. But once the dust settled, the message was clear: this is a Budget that quietly raises revenue, largely without changing the main tax rates, but through a series of targeted reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break down what was announced, how it affects you, and how to plan ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Economic Backdrop: Why This Budget Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Budget lands at a time when the UK economy is facing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Slow but steady GDP growth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>High government borrowing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rising pressure on public services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Persistent cost-of-living challenges</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stagnant productivity and weak business investment</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has effectively ruled out large headline tax cuts or drastic spending reductions. Instead, the strategy is to raise revenue <strong>gradually and structurally</strong>, particularly from investment income and higher-value property, while protecting public services and supporting families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a short-term tweak, it is the beginning of a <strong>long-term reshaping of the tax system</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Tax Changes: What’s Changing and When</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most important measures clients need to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A. Income Tax &amp; National Insurance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>➤ <em>Headline rates stay the same – but thresholds are frozen</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Income tax rates remain unchanged</strong> at\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>20% basic rate</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>40% higher rate</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>45% additional rate</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thresholds remain frozen until at least April 2031</strong><br>Fiscal drag means more of your future pay rises could be taxed at higher rates.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>➤ <em>Pension salary sacrifice reforms (from April 2029)</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, pension salary sacrifice allows you to save income tax <em>and</em> National Insurance (NI) by exchanging salary for employer pension contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the new rules:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The first £2,000 per year of pension salary sacrifice remains NI-free</strong>, as today</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anything above £2,000 per year will now be subject to both employer and employee NI</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This reduces the attractiveness of large pension sacrifice arrangements, especially for higher earners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">B. Dividend Tax: Rates Are Rising</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>April 2026</strong>, dividend tax rates increase by <strong>2 percentage points</strong> for basic and higher-rate taxpayers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dividend tax changes:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Band</strong></td><td><strong>Current Rate</strong></td><td><strong>New Rate (2026)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic rate</td><td><strong>8.75%</strong></td><td><strong>10.75%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Higher rate</td><td><strong>33.75%</strong></td><td><strong>35.75%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Additional rate</td><td><strong>39.35%</strong></td><td><strong>39.35%</strong> (unchanged)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This has a significant impact on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Company directors taking dividends</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investors with taxable dividend income</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Individuals with portfolios held outside ISAs or pensions</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">C. Savings Income Tax: Also Increasing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>April 2027</strong>, the tax you pay on interest (if you exceed your Personal Savings Allowance or have substantial non-ISA savings) rises by <strong>2 percentage points</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings interest tax changes:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Band</strong></td><td><strong>Current Rate</strong></td><td><strong>New Rate (2027)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic rate</td><td><strong>20%</strong></td><td><strong>22%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Higher rate</td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>42%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Additional</td><td><strong>45%</strong></td><td><strong>47%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ISAs remain tax-free and will be even more valuable going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">D. Property Income Tax: A New, Higher Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>April 2027</strong>, property (rental) income will have new, separate tax bands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Property income tax changes:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Band</strong></td><td><strong>Current Equivalent Rate</strong></td><td><strong>New Property Rate (2027)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic rate</td><td><strong>20%</strong></td><td><strong>22%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Higher rate</td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>42%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Additional</td><td><strong>45%</strong></td><td><strong>47%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finance cost (mortgage interest) relief for landlords will be updated to match the new basic property rate of <strong>22%</strong>, up slightly from 20%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Portfolio landlords</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Higher-rate taxpayers with leveraged properties</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Those with personally held buy-to-lets</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">E. High-Value Property: “Mansion Tax” Style Surcharge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>April 2028</strong>, a new council tax surcharge applies to property valued over <strong>£2 million</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indicative annual charges:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>£2m–£2.5m:</strong> approx. <strong>£2,500 per year</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>£5m+:</strong> approx. <strong>£7,500 per year</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a recurring annual cost for high-value homeowners and may influence future market dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">F. Families &amp; Welfare</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Major change:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>➤ <em>The two-child benefit cap is abolished from April 2026</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most significant welfare reforms in years and will increase support for many families with more than two children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal Credit, disability support, and other allowances will also rise with inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">G. Pensioners</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>State Pension triple lock is maintained</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pensioners will see a <strong>4.8% increase</strong> to their State Pension from April 2026</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most pensioners will not be directly affected by the new wealth and investment taxes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">H. Cost of Living: Energy, Fuel, and EVs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Energy bills</strong>: around <strong>£150 off</strong> typical household bills from April 2026</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fuel duty</strong>: the 5p cut is <strong>maintained</strong>, and duty is frozen until at least September 2026</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rail fares</strong>: temporarily <strong>frozen</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Electric Vehicles</strong>: new EV road pricing from 2028/29\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>approx. <strong>3p per mile</strong> for EVs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>approx. <strong>1.5p per mile</strong> for hybrids</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I.

      "content": "\n<p><strong><em>How the latest tax changes will impact landlords, buyers, sellers and property investors, and how Black &amp; White Accounting can help them navigate the new landscape</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>2025 Budget</strong> has introduced some of the biggest changes to the UK property and investment tax landscape in years. While much of the focus in the media has been on families and public services, the fine print contains <strong>major implications for landlords, homeowners, second-home owners, and high-value property buyers</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For estate and letting agents, understanding these changes is essential, because your clients will soon be asking questions. Some will benefit, others will face higher tax bills, and many will need guidance on how to structure their property affairs going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a clear breakdown of the key changes, what they mean for your clients, and how <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong> can support you and them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. High-Value Properties Face a New Annual Charge (“Mansion Tax” Style Surcharge)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the headline announcements from Budget 2025 is a new <strong>council tax surcharge</strong> on residential properties valued over <strong>£2 million</strong>, coming into effect from <strong>April 2028</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Indicative annual charges:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>£2m–£2.5m:</strong> around <strong>£2,500 per year</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>£5m+:</strong> around <strong>£7,500 per year</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impact on your clients</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Owners of high-value homes will see <strong>higher annual running costs</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Buyers may factor this surcharge into offers, potentially affecting property values at the top end of the market.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sellers may need to reconsider pricing strategies and timing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investors in luxury buy-to-let properties will need to revisit their financial models.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This won’t deter all buyers, but it <strong>changes the economics</strong> of high-end homeownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Tax on Rental Income Is Rising</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A major area of reform that directly impacts landlords is the overhaul of <strong>property income tax</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>April 2027</strong>, rental income will be taxed at new, higher rates:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Property income tax rates (from 2027):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Band</strong></td><td><strong>Current Rate</strong></td><td><strong>New Rate</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic rate</td><td><strong>20%</strong></td><td><strong>22%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Higher rate</td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>42%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Additional rate</td><td><strong>45%</strong></td><td><strong>47%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finance cost (mortgage interest) relief</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Currently given at <strong>20%</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 2027, relief will be aligned to the new <strong>22%</strong> basic property rate</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impact on your landlord clients</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lower net rental profits</strong>, particularly for higher-rate taxpayers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased pressure on landlords with <strong>mortgaged properties</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some landlords may consider selling, particularly those with small portfolios or highly leveraged properties</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More professional landlords are likely to explore <strong>incorporation</strong> or <strong>portfolio restructuring</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most important changes for agents to be aware of, because it affects <strong>landlord retention</strong>, <strong>rent levels</strong>, and <strong>market supply</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Higher Taxes on Dividends and Savings: Hitting Property Investors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many landlords and property investors rely on dividends from their companies or interest on savings used for deposits or portfolio funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budget 2025 increases these taxes too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dividend tax (from April 2026):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Band</strong></td><td><strong>Current</strong></td><td><strong>New</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic</td><td><strong>8.75%</strong></td><td><strong>10.75%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Higher</td><td><strong>33.75%</strong></td><td><strong>35.75%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Additional</td><td><strong>39.35%</strong></td><td><strong>39.35%</strong> (unchanged)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings income tax (from April 2027):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Band</strong></td><td><strong>Current</strong></td><td><strong>New</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic</td><td><strong>20%</strong></td><td><strong>22%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Higher</td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>42%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Additional</td><td><strong>45%</strong></td><td><strong>47%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Buy-to-let investors operating through limited companies will face <strong>higher personal tax on extracted profits</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investors with large cash reserves (sale proceeds, deposit funds, bridging finance buffers) will pay more tax on interest</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This reinforces the importance of <strong>using ISAs</strong>, <strong>holding companies</strong>, and <strong>careful extraction planning</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. EV Road Pricing &amp; Transport Costs: Relevant for Rural and Commuter Markets</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From 2028/29:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>3p per mile</strong> for electric vehicles</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>1.5p per mile</strong> for hybrids</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This won’t directly affect the property market, but agents working in <strong>commuter belts</strong>, <strong>rural areas</strong>, or <strong>locations with limited public transport</strong> may find buyers more sensitive to mileage costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. High-Value Landlords &amp; Developers Should Expect More Compliance Activity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Budget includes a substantial investment in HMRC compliance, especially around:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Undeclared rental income</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Property portfolio structuring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Capital gains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overseas property ownership</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use of LLPs, SPVs and offshore companies</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This means more landlords will be seeking professional advice, and agents who can point them toward reliable support will be valued.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Positive News for Families: More Disposable Income for Certain Tenants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has abolished the <strong>two-child benefit cap</strong> from April 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For agents, this could mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>More households with <strong>improved affordability</strong> for rents</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased stability for families in the private rented sector</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Potential upward pressure on demand for <strong>larger rental homes</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A small but meaningful shift, particularly in family-oriented rental markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.

      "content": "\n<p>If you caught the recent Sky News headline, you might have raised an eyebrow. According to the UK’s fiscal watchdog, <strong>over two million jobs could be affected by Artificial Intelligence within the next decade</strong>. AI isn’t creeping in quietly. It’s arriving with fireworks, headlines and plenty of questions about who will be impacted and how fast things might change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the good news. If you run a business, you don’t need to panic. AI is far less about replacing everything and far more about reshaping how work gets done. Think of it as having an extremely efficient assistant who works 24/7, doesn’t take annual leave and never complains about spreadsheets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So What Did the Sky News Report Actually Say?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sky’s coverage highlighted several key points worth knowing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>AI could reshape financial and professional sectors dramatically over the next 10 years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Millions of roles may change, particularly those involving repetitive admin, number-crunching, and manual data tasks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Productivity could rise, but only for businesses that adapt early and learn how to work <em>with</em> AI rather than against it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Translation for business owners:<br><strong>The businesses that thrive will be the ones that embrace AI sensibly and strategically.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Upside of AI for Business Owners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI brings some serious perks, here are just a few examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It takes the boring stuff off your desk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data entry, invoice matching, receipt sorting and mind-numbing admin can all be handled by AI, freeing you up for the work you actually enjoy (or at least don’t dread).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It makes your numbers faster and more accurate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI doesn’t get tired. It doesn’t work late and make mistakes. It processes financial data quickly and cleanly, giving you clearer insights sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It gives accountants superpowers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we spend less time on paperwork, we spend more time on strategic stuff like tax planning, forecasts, business advice and finding ways to improve your profitability and other key business objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It can save money</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More automation often means fewer hours spent on admin, lower operational costs and smoother financial operations overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But Let’s Be Honest… AI Isn’t Magic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clever, but it’s not perfect. Here are the limits worth remembering:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It can’t understand context like a human</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give AI a quirky, unusual transaction and it might get confused. Give it a tax planning scenario and… well… please don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It can be confidently wrong</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes AI produces an answer that looks right but isn’t. That’s why human oversight isn’t optional. It’s essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It still needs guardrails</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security, compliance, ethics and data protection require human judgment and professional standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It won’t benefit all businesses equally</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A micro-business with simple books gets different gains than a multi-site manufacturer with complex costing or stock systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is powerful, but it’s <em>not</em> a replacement for people. It’s a tool that works best when guided by humans who know what they’re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What This Means for Different Types of Businesses</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI’s impact will vary, but here’s a quick, light-hearted look:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Retail and e-commerce</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI + loads of transactions = a match made in heaven. Automation helps clean up financial chaos and speeds up reporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Service-based businesses</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less admin, more time with clients. What’s not to love?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Manufacturing and wholesale</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can help with repetitive processes, but humans still need to check the numbers behind costing, stock and margins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Startups</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI gives founders more time to build, pitch, develop and dream. And fewer late nights spent sorting receipts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SMEs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most small businesses benefit the most and the fastest from automation because time saved equals money earned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Should Business Owners Do Right Now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s your AI action plan, made simple:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Find the repetitive tasks</strong><br>If it’s boring and someone hates doing it, AI can probably help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Start small and experiment</strong><br>No need to go full sci-fi. Dip your toes in first.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work closely with your accountant</strong><br>They’ll help you choose the right tools and avoid expensive mistakes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep compliance and security in mind</strong><br>AI tools vary. Choose wisely.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on the areas where humans shine</strong><br>Decision making, strategy, planning and interpreting the story behind your numbers.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Black &amp; White Accounting Helps Clients Thrive in the AI Era</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where we come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We help you understand where AI actually makes sense</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every shiny tool is worth using. We’ll help you cut through the noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We help you choose and implement the right tech</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No jargon, no overwhelm. Just the solutions that work for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We review and interpret the numbers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can crunch data, but we explain what it means and what you should do next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We support you as you grow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI helps businesses scale, and we make sure your financial foundations scale with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We keep you future-ready</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next decade will bring big changes. With us, you’ll be prepared, confident and ahead of the curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sky News report is clear: AI will reshape the next decade. The question is whether businesses fear it or harness it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we help you harness it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to explore what AI could mean for your business specifically, we’d love to chat.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>It’s easy for things to slip through the cracks; a property inherited years ago, a casual let that turned long-term, or a change in circumstances that went unreported. But if a landlord has rental income that hasn’t been declared to HMRC, it’s vital to act fast, before HMRC comes knocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For estate and letting agents, this isn’t just a matter of good practice; it’s part of your <strong>professional responsibility</strong>. Being able to spot when a landlord may need to disclose undeclared income, and guiding them in the right direction, protects your clients, your reputation, and your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we help landlords and agents handle undeclared rental income in the right way; quickly, discreetly, and efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">💡 Why Undeclared Rental Income Is a Big Deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC is taking rental income more seriously than ever before. With new digital systems, cross-checking data from letting agents, the Land Registry, mortgage lenders, and even online rental platforms, undeclared income rarely goes unnoticed for long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, HMRC’s <strong>Let Property Campaign</strong> &#8211; a long-running disclosure initiative, has already recovered hundreds of millions in unpaid tax from landlords who voluntarily came forward. Those who don’t disclose and are later caught can face hefty penalties, interest charges, and in extreme cases, prosecution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">⚖️ The Professional Obligations of Estate and Letting Agents</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Agents play a crucial role in promoting compliance, and the law expects you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under <strong>anti-money laundering (AML)</strong> and <strong>professional conduct regulations</strong>, agents must take reasonable steps to ensure the clients they act for are legitimate and tax-compliant. If you <strong>suspect</strong> that a landlord has undeclared rental income, you have a duty to <strong>inform and advise</strong> them that they need to make a full disclosure to HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not about policing clients; it’s about protecting them. Helping a landlord bring their tax affairs up to date demonstrates professionalism, builds trust, and reduces the risk of HMRC scrutiny for both them and your agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚨 What to Do If You Discover a Landlord Hasn’t Been Declaring Income</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find that a landlord has undeclared rental income, the key is to act <strong>quickly, carefully, and with the right guidance</strong>. Here’s the best approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Encourage them to seek professional advice immediately.</strong><br>Direct them to a qualified accountant or tax adviser who can handle the disclosure process &#8211; like the team at Black &amp; White Accounting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advise them not to contact HMRC directly without advice.</strong><br>Saying the wrong thing early on can complicate matters. The right professional can manage the disclosure strategically.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reassure them that voluntary disclosure is the right move.</strong><br>Coming forward through the official Let Property Campaign significantly reduces penalties and shows HMRC they’re cooperating.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid offering tax advice yourself.</strong><br>Stay within your professional remit &#8211; your role is to guide, not to calculate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>By helping your landlords take action early, you’ll be saving them money, stress, and potential legal trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🏢 What Is the Let Property Campaign?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Let Property Campaign (LPC)</strong> is HMRC’s official scheme for landlords to <strong>voluntarily disclose undeclared rental income</strong>. It’s designed for individuals (not companies) who have underpaid or not paid tax on UK residential property income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the campaign, landlords can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Declare income from one or more UK properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pay the right amount of tax, plus interest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Receive <strong>reduced penalties</strong> &#8211; often as low as 0–20%, compared to up to 100% if HMRC discovers the omission first.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s straightforward but must be done properly. Landlords must calculate the full amount owed, submit the disclosure, and make payment within 90 days. That’s where expert help is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">📋 How Landlords Can Prepare a Disclosure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what the process typically involves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Notify HMRC</strong> of their intention to disclose under the Let Property Campaign.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gather records</strong> &#8211; rental income, expenses, mortgage statements, and letting agreements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Calculate the tax owed</strong>, including any penalties and interest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Submit the full disclosure and payment</strong> within the 90-day window.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Handled properly, it’s a clean slate &#8211; and often far less painful than landlords fear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧭 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At <strong>Black &amp; White Accounting</strong>, we’ve helped countless landlords bring their tax affairs up to date smoothly and confidentially &#8211; while protecting their future rental income from unnecessary penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how we support both <strong>landlords and agents</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Confidential advice</strong> &#8211; we handle sensitive cases discreetly, protecting your client relationships.<br>✅ <strong>Complete disclosure management</strong> &#8211; from contacting HMRC to preparing calculations and submissions.<br>✅ <strong>Penalty reduction</strong> &#8211; we ensure the disclosure qualifies for the lowest possible penalty rate.<br>✅ <strong>Ongoing tax compliance</strong> &#8211; helping landlords stay fully compliant for future years.<br>✅ <strong>Agent support</strong> &#8211; we provide resources and briefings for your team so you can confidently guide landlords when these situations arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our aim is simple: to turn potential problems into opportunities for clarity, compliance, and long-term peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🚀 Stay Ahead &#8211; Protect Your Clients and Your Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With HMRC’s data tracking more sophisticated than ever, undeclared rental income is a risk landlords can’t afford to ignore. But handled early and properly, it doesn’t need to become a crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For estate and letting agents, being proactive isn’t just good service, it’s good business.

      "content": "\n<p><strong>…and the surprisingly fun history behind it</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎉 A (Very) Short History of the Office Christmas Party</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into HMRC rules, let’s warm up with a bit of festive trivia…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Victorian employers</strong> actually kick-started the tradition of hosting Christmas feasts for employees, usually goose, ale and a half-day off.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>By the <strong>1920s</strong>, companies were throwing “modern” office parties complete with dancing and paper crowns.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And by the <strong>1980s</strong>, office Christmas parties had fully evolved into legendary spectacles of karaoke, questionable dancing, and enough tinsel to wrap the building twice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the office Christmas party is <em>still</em> a cherished British workplace ritual, and HMRC, surprisingly, is totally fine with it… as long as you follow their rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎁 HMRC &amp; Christmas: What’s Allowed, What’s Not</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break down the festive tax rules in a way even the office Grinch can understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎄 1. The Annual Staff Party Allowance (The Big One)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC allows businesses to hold <strong>annual events</strong>, including Christmas parties, <strong>totally tax-free</strong> <em>if</em> all the following are true:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ The event is open to all staff</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t need to be <em>just</em> one event, multiple events across the year count, as long as <strong>all employees</strong> have the option to attend at least one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ The total cost is £150 per head</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Food &amp; drink</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Entertainment</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Venue hire</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transport</li>\n\n\n\n<li>VAT</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Important:</strong><br>It’s <strong>not</strong> a <em>£150 allowance;</em> it’s a hard limit.<br>If you go even <strong>£1 over</strong>, the <em>entire</em> amount becomes taxable as a benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ It must be an annual event</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christmas party? Perfect.<br>Summer BBQ? Also fine.<br>Spontaneous “we survived Q3” drinks? Not covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎁 2. Trivial Benefits: Gifts for Staff</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC lets you give staff small Christmas gifts <em>tax-free</em> under the <strong>Trivial Benefits</strong> rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ The gift must cost £50 or less</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it costs £50.01… sorry, no mince pie of mercy, the whole amount is taxable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ It cannot be cash or a cash voucher</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But store vouchers (non-cash) are fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ It must not be a reward for work</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thanks for smashing your KPIs” = ❌<br>“Happy Christmas, enjoy this chocolate hamper!” = ✔️</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ Directors need to be extra careful</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For close company directors, total trivial benefits are capped at <strong>£300 per year</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎄 3. Gifts for Clients: What You <em>Can</em> and <em>Can’t</em> Do</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving a box of festive treats to clients? Lovely. Tax-deductible? Sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔️ What HMRC Allows</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Client gifts are allowable <em>if</em> they:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cost <strong>£50 or less per person</strong>, <strong>and</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are <strong>promotional</strong> (your business name or logo must be on them),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are <strong>not food, drink, tobacco, or vouchers</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>❌ What HMRC Doesn’t Allow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Alcohol</strong>, mince pies, chocolates, hampers = <em>not</em> deductible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gifts over <strong>£50</strong> = no deduction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gifts without your branding = no deduction</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So that branded notebook is fine.<br>That branded bottle of Prosecco? Sadly… no.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🧦 Fun Festive Fact Break</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HMRC once clarified that if you give an employee a turkey, it <strong>can</strong> be a trivial benefit…<br>But if it’s a particularly <em>luxury</em> turkey, it might exceed £50, in which case your turkey has become a taxable benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A genuinely iconic HMRC moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎉 Common Christmas Questions (Answered!)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can we hold multiple parties?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! Just make sure the <strong>combined cost</strong> of the events you invite all staff to doesn’t exceed <strong>£150 per head</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are virtual Christmas parties covered?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, even Zoom-based quizzes, entertainment and home-delivered meal kits can be included in the £150 per head allowance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can we claim VAT back on party costs?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The party is for staff (not clients), and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your business is VAT-registered.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎄 In Summary: The Helpful HMRC Christmas Checklist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allowed Tax-Free for Staff</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>✔️ Parties up to £150/head</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✔️ Trivial gifts ≤ £50 each</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✔️ Director trivial benefits up to £300/year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>✔️ Virtual parties</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not Allowed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>❌ Cash gifts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ Gifts > £50 (for trivial benefits)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ Rewards for work</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ Client gifts of food, drink or vouchers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>❌ Parties where only certain staff are invited</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎁 Want a Stress-Free Christmas?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black &amp; White Accounting is here to help you stay compliant <em>and</em> festive.<br>From party planning budgets to year-end tax optimisation, we help your business make the most of the season, without any unpleasant surprises from HMRC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like, I can also:<br>✨ Create a social media version of this blog<br>✨ Create a client-facing PDF<br>✨ Turn this into an email newsletter<br>✨ Add illustrations or brand styling</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just tell me what you’d like!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎁 How Black &amp; White Accounting Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Black &amp; White Accounting, we know that Christmas is one of the busiest and most joyful times of the year — but it can also be a time when businesses unintentionally fall foul of HMRC’s festive fine print.
