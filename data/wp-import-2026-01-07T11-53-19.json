      "content": "The company car has been a favourite target for the Government and the taxman for a decade or more now so much so that it’s actually hard to decide whether it’s a perk of the job or not anymore. However, in the global effort to push green technologies onto an ever more willing public increasingly concerned about the future of the environment, the company car may have had a reprieve.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nA partial reprieve we’re quick to add because it only applies to the cleanest and greenest cars. The rate on no-emission and low-emission cars dropped dramatically on the 5<sup>th</sup> April 2020 although, given what’s been happening in the world in recent months, it’s not surprising that this change will have passed many people by.\n\nIn this article, we explain in detail (using as little jargon as possible) this important change includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>what company car tax is</li>\n \t<li>what P11d is and what it means in relation to the value of a car</li>\n \t<li>how to work out company car tax</li>\n \t<li>a worked example to demonstrate the big difference in cost by going electric</li>\n \t<li>the advantages and disadvantages of going electric</li>\n \t<li>getting advice from an accountant on electric cars and company cars in general</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is company car tax?</h2>\nYou may have heard of benefits-in-kind (BiK) – they are non-monetary incentives and rewards given by a company to an employee. Standard benefits-in-kind include childcare, health insurance, and company cars.\n\nEach year, nearly all of the benefits-in-kind given to an employee must be shared with HMRC via a P11d form. The employee then pays income tax and National Insurance on the value of the benefits and the company pays National Insurance Employers’ Contributions.\n\nExcept in the rarest of cases, HMRC does not accept appeals to waive benefits-in-kind payments on a company car on the grounds that the car is only used for business purposes. They will contend that the employee derives personal benefit from the use of the car – this includes the commute into work.\n<h2>The P11d value of car</h2>\nCars are expensive and it would be unreasonable to ask a basic rate taxpayer, for example, to pay tax of 20% on the entire value of a company car at its new retail price all in one go.\n\nInstead, HMRC calculates the benefit-in-kind value of the car based upon a calculation which includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the price of the car minus registration fee, road tax, and other non-taxable costs (the manufacturer sets the value of the car) and</li>\n \t<li>the amount of pollution it produces as measured by grams per kilometre of CO<sub>2</sub></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to work out company car tax</h2>\nTo work out company car tax, you first find the P11d value of your car.\n\nYou then multiply that P11d value by the company car tax rate – those rates are in the table below:\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"

In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, that’s 20% for people earning up to £50,000, 40% for people earning between £50,001 and £150,000, and 45% for people earning £150,001 and above.\n<h2>Worked example</h2>\nAs you can see from the table above, the P11d value of cars with zero emissions and those with emissions of between 1 and 50 grams drops dramatically from the 2019/2020 tax year to the 2020/2021 tax year.\n\nA drop this substantial is likely to shape the choices made by companies when ordering the fleet for their staff. Not only do the staff benefit but so does the company in the form of lower National Insurance Employers’ Contribution payments.\n\nHow would this work in the real world? Let’s compare how much cheaper the choice of a zero-emission car is with a standard car powered by an internal combustion engine.\n\nLet’s consider a BMW 520d M Sport 4dr Auto with 151g/km of emissions and the zero emission Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD 4dr Auto.\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>Vehicle</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\"><strong>BMW 520d M Sport 4dr Auto</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\"><strong>Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD 4dr Auto</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>P11D value</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£40,595</td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£49,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>Top speed</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\">146mph</td>\n<td width=\"30%\">145mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>Emissions</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\">151g/km</td>\n<td width=\"30%\">0g/km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>2020/2021 BiK cost per month</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£473.61</td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£0.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>2021/2022 BiK cost per month</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£473.61</td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£16.33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40%\"><strong>2022/2023 BiK cost per month</strong></td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£473.61</td>\n<td width=\"30%\">£32.67</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe BMW would cost your employee £17,049 over the 3 years in comparison to £588 for the Tesla.\n\nThat is quite an incentive. Will it fast forward the adoption of zero and low emission driving in the UK? We’ll know in a couple of years’ time.\n<h2>Advantages and disadvantages of going electric</h2>\nThe financial advantage to switching to electric cars is clear from the worked example above. In addition, businesses purchasing ultra-low or no emission vehicles qualify for a 100% first year allowance – that’s equivalent to full tax relief on the car in the year it was purchased.\n\nElectric cars are expensive to purchase however prices have begun to fall in recent years. Some employees may also be reluctant to make the switch because of fears over the lack of charging points (especially if they don’t have a charging point installed at their premises), the time cars take to charge, the range of the batteries, and, according to many, they’re not particularly enjoyable to drive.\n<h2>Company cars and your business</h2>\nIf you’d like to talk with an accountant about reducing the amount of taxation you and your staff have to pay on company cars or if you’re considering refreshing your fleet, get in touch with us and we’ll run worked examples for your company based on what you own now and what you’re considering replacing it with.\n\nCall our team today on freephone 0800 140 4644 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a>.",

      "content": "Owing someone or another company money is always stressful but, when you’re in debt to HM Revenue and Customs, it can be a particularly uncomfortable experience.\n\nIf you have fallen into arrears on your tax payments, you can guarantee that HMRC will do everything in their power to make sure they get the money they’re owed.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, what do you need to know. In this article, we’ll cover:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the powers the tax man actually has</li>\n \t<li>the value in talking to HMRC</li>\n \t<li>the Time to Pay system</li>\n \t<li>whether a loan is the right course of action</li>\n \t<li>the benefits of speaking with an accountant about HMRC debt</li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>HMRC’s infinite power with revenue debt</h2>\nThe taxman is the most serious creditor you can have chasing you for payment because HMRC has a whole range of powers available to it for collecting the money you owe them.\n\nBack in April 2014, a new law was passed allowing HMRC to seize tax that is owed directly from an individual’s or a company’s bank account. While they will issue a number of warnings before they do this, HMRC  may even choose to have your bank account frozen as a warning sign to you that they will be taking the money soon.\n\nThey are, however, bound by the rule that they must leave at least £5,000 across your bank and savings accounts and that they can only seize amounts upwards of £1,000.\n\nA spokesperson for HMRC told <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/11245113/When-the-taxman-can-take-money-from-your-bank-account-and-Isa.html\">the Telegraph</a> that HMRC can “take money from any account – including any type of Isa – it does not matter where they are held,” but that “the people we are targeting will have had plenty of warning and time to settle their affairs.”\n\nIn addition to this direct recovery of debt, HMRC have other ‘enforcement actions’ in their repertoire to recover the money they are owed. These include:\n<h3>Court action</h3>\nIf you do not pay the money you owe HMRC, they may decide to take you to court. Should the court uphold HMRC’s decision, you could be made to pay court fees and HMRC’s costs on top of the tax you owe. Read more about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/if-you-dont-pay-your-tax-bill/court-action\">court action here</a>.\n<h3>Distraint</h3>\nThis involves HMRC taking the assets that you own from you and then selling them to pay off your debt. They send a bailiff or enforcement officer to your home or business to seize property that will cover the cost of your tax bill plus certain fees. Find out more on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/if-you-dont-pay-your-tax-bill/taking-control-of-goods\">gov.uk</a> website.\n<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>\nIf you do not pay your tax bill or your debts to HMRC exceed the assets you own, you could be made bankrupt. When this happens you may lose your home, business, savings, and investments in the process. See more about what happens during <a href=\"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/what-happens-when-you-become-bankrupt\">bankruptcy here</a>.\n<h3>HMRC Security Bonds</h3>\n<strong> </strong>When HMRC suspect there is a risk you will not pay your future tax liabilities on time, they can ask you to pay a deposit – or bond – on various types of tax. If your business is issued a Notice of Requirement for security then the debt can even be transferred to you personally. <a href=\"https://www.companydebt.com/hmrc-tax-problems/hmrc-security-bond-when-do-you-have-to-pay-security/\">Read more here</a>.\n<h3>Winding up petition</h3>\n<strong> </strong>Failing to pay your company’s tax bills (corporation tax, VAT, and PAYE) could result in a winding up petition being issued. If you don’t pay back the amount HMRC are demanding within seven days, your bank accounts will be frozen, you will not be able to sell or transfer any company assets, and other creditors could use the same petition to wind up your company. See what happens following a <a href=\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/insolvency/content/100712\">winding up order</a> here.\n\nHow should you handle HMRC if you owe them money that you can’t pay back within the timeframe given by HMRC?\n<h2>Talk to HMRC</h2>\nIf you know you can’t pay your bill when it arrives, the first course of action should always be to get in touch with HMRC directly. Simply not paying your tax may appear to them like evasion which is a serious criminal offence.\n\nHMRC may agree that you won’t be able to pay the total bill upfront and they will often offer a solution to help you meet your tax obligations without financially crippling you.\n<h2>Time to Pay Arrangements</h2>\nPayment plans like a time-to-pay arrangement give you the option to pay the tax you owe in more manageable monthly instalments rather than in one big lump sum.\n\nIt is important to note that time to pay arrangements only apply to the tax arrears in question. You will still be required to pay all future taxes on time and in full.\n\nIf you are struggling with your tax bill, contact HMRC ahead of your payment deadline to ask if this would be available to you. You can find out more about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/time-to-pay\">Time To Pay</a> here and you can apply to pay tax in instalments<a href=\"https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/pay-what-you-owe-in-instalments\"> here</a>.\n<h2>Use a loan</h2>\nSince HMRC have begun escalating the number of winding up orders they’re issuing, some businessowners choose to take out loans to pay all of their overdue tax bill in one go.\n\nYou can then spread the cost of your tax bill across a year or a number of years with your monthly loan repayments. Please note that the interest on any loan you take out will mean that you end up paying your finance provider more than you would have paid HMRC.\n\nOne of the most common type of loans taken out to service an HMRC debt is a bridging loan – please be careful with these as they require security. If you only have equity in your primary residential property, the bridging loan company will accept that but, because it’s secured on your own home, it’s regulated and you’ll have a maximum of 12 months before you have to pay the loan back in full.\n<h2>Work with your accountant</h2>\nIf you are in VAT arrears or if you are having trouble meeting your PAYE bill, you should try to negotiate with HMRC wherever possible.\n\nThis is a good time to take advantage of your accountant’s experience in dealing with the taxman. They will, in many cases, be able to help you to reach an agreement with HMRC to help you manage and pay down the debt.\n<h2>Work with Black and White Accounting</h2>\nIf we foresee that you may have trouble paying HMRC when a bill becomes due, we’ll let you know that we have concerns. Working with your accountant will give you the time you need to make cutbacks in your spending, to push customers to pay their invoices, and to make alternative arrangements with HMRC for a payment plan.\n\nAt Black and White Accounting we have over 150 years’ experience between us in helping private and corporate clients minimise the amount of tax they pay as well as negotiating with HMRC on how arrears can be managed and paid back.\n\nCall our team today on freephone 0800 140 4644 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a>.",

      "content": "Despite it feeling to the contrary sometimes, not every penny we earn is taken by HMRC. There are number of different tax allowances that we can take advantage of which shields some of our income from the public purse. The most significant of these is the Personal Allowance – currently set at £12,500, whatever we earn under that amount attracts no income tax.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nOf course, it’s not quite true that we don’t pay any tax on earnings below that amount. We start paying National Insurance at 12% once our earnings reach £9,516 a year. For the self-employed, it’s worse – you pay Class 2 NI when your profits/income reaches £6,475 a year.\n\nOne of the newer tax-saving incentives is the marriage allowance – a tax-free amount of money which means that, under certain circumstances, you’ll be taxed up to £250 less if you are one of a married couple or a civil partnership.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover:\n<ul>\n \t<li>what the marriage allowance is</li>\n \t<li>who qualifies to receive it</li>\n \t<li>what the current financial thresholds are for a successful application</li>\n \t<li>how you apply for it</li>\n \t<li>what happens if your spouse or civil partner has died recently</li>\n \t<li>how you receive the money</li>\n \t<li>how to claim for previous years if you have not yet done so</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is the Marriage Allowance?</h2>\nThe UK Marriage Allowance is a benefit available to married couples or those in a civil partnership.\n\nThe higher-earning spouse may receive up to an additional £1,250 on top of their personal allowance in the form of a transfer from their lower earning partner. To qualify, the higher earner must pay income tax at the basic rate and the lower earning must not earn more than the personal allowance.\n\nThe Marriage Allowance allows the lower earning partner to gift 10% of their personal allowance to their higher earning partner up to a value of £1,250. In effect, this would mean that the higher earning partner’s personal allowance is now £13,750 and not £12,500.\n\nAs they are not paying tax on this additional £1,250, they save £250 – the basic rate of tax is 20%.\n\nCurrently, for the lower earning partner to transfer £1,250 to their higher earning partner, they must earn less than £11,250.\n\nWhat about when a lower earning partner earns £11,500, for example? The higher earning partner would still receive the £1,250 addition to their personal allowance, but you would pay tax on £250.\n\nLikewise, if the lower earning partner earned £12,000, they would pay 20% tax on £750 and their partner would still get the additional £1,250 on their personal income.\n<h2>Who qualifies to receive Marriage Allowance?</h2>\nThe following criteria need to be met in order for you and your partner to benefit from the Marriage Allowance:\n<ul>\n \t<li>be married or in a civil partnership</li>\n \t<li>both must be born after April 5<sup>th</sup>, 1935 – if one, or both of you was born before this, you should apply to claim the ‘Married Couple’s Allowance’ which is a slightly different system</li>\n \t<li>one member of the couple must earn below the basic allowance while the other partner earns above it and currently pays income tax at the basic rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is the current financial threshold for marriage allowance?</h2>\nIn England, the lower earning partner must earn no more than £12,500 per year. The higher earner in the marriage must earn between £12,500 and £50,000.\n\nIn Scotland, there is a slight difference. The higher earner must be earning between £12,500 and £43,430 – however the rate is at 20%.\n<h2>How do I apply for marriage allowance and will my tax code change?</h2>\nThe Marriage Allowance scheme is organised through HMRC. Individuals should apply either through via the HMRC website or by calling them on 0200 300 3300.\n\nIf you qualify, the recipient’s tax code will usually change to ‘M’ to state that they are receiving a marriage allowance from their partner. The partner who transfers the money will usually have their tax code changed to ‘N’, showing that they too are using the marriage allowance taxing system.\n<h2>What happens if my partner died recently? Can I apply and get it backdated?</h2>\nYes. If your spouse died after April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2016, you are eligible to apply for Marriage Allowance including backdated claims (more on those later). In this case, you should ring HMRC Income Tax Helpline and discuss this with them.\n<h2>How will we receive the money for our marriage allowance?</h2>\nThe partner whose personal allowance has been increased pays a lower amount of tax on their salary every month.\n<h2>Will we pay tax on the money we ‘earn’ through this?</h2>\nNo. The marriage allowance is an incentive and you do not get taxed on this money. It’s a way of paying less tax when one partner is not using all of their personal allowance.\n<h2>Backdating claims</h2>\nThe Marriage Allowance was first introduced in the 2015/2016 tax year. In 2017, up to two million UK couples were not claiming for this allowance when they were entitled to it.\n\nYou can claim Marriage Allowance retrospectively for up to four years.\n<ul>\n \t<li>2018/19 tax year: up to £1,190 of the lower earner's personal allowance may be transferred with a maximum £238 tax saving per household.</li>\n \t<li>2017/18 tax year: up to £1,150 of the lower earner's personal allowance may be transferred with a maximum £230 tax saving per household.</li>\n \t<li>2016/17 tax year: up to £1,100 of the lower earner's personal allowance may be transferred with a maximum £220 tax saving per household.</li>\n</ul>\nYou may apply for a retrospective payment online at HMRC’s website – click <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-marriage-allowance\">here</a>. Your refund is paid by cheque.\n\nHelp with tax allowances from Black and White Accounting\n\nThe marriage allowance tax is one of the many different methods you can use to save a small amount of money you pay in tax each year.

      "content": "Income disparity has been a growing concern for some time among politicians and campaigners. For many people who work hourly paid jobs, it can be incredibly difficult to make ends meet. In the ten years following the Great Recession of 2008, inflation outstripped wage growth in many of those years.\n\nThe UK introduced The Minimum Wage on the 1<sup>st</sup> of April 1999. The new law meant that employers were now legally obliged to pay their staff a set amount of money (or more) per hour for the labour they provided.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe’ve had over 20 years of the Minimum Wage in the UK yet and, in that time, it has risen from £3.60 in its founding year to £8.20 – where it currently stands in 2020.\n\nThe Living Wage was introduced in 2016 and it applies to workers aged 25 and over. This is also binding legislation meaning that employers must pay qualifying members of staff a minimum of £8.72 an hour.\n\nThere is also the Real Living Wage – not a government scheme but rather a campaign run by the <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/living-wage-foundation\">Living Wage Foundation</a>, an “independent movement of business and people who campaign for the idea that a hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay.”\n\nThey believe that the current levels of both the Minimum Wage and the Living Wage are not enough for staff to get by on and that, in the real world, staff need more money to pay for their monthly rent, food, and other expenses.\n\nUnlike the Minimum Wage and the Living Wage, the Real Living Wage is set at the same rate for the UK except for London where the recommended minimum hourly rate of pay is higher.\n\nIn this article, we take a detailed look at the current Minimum Wage, Living Wage, and Real Living Wage here in the UK and which factors employers should consider when paying their staff.\n<h2>What is the current UK Minimum Wage?</h2>\nDepending on the age of a worker and on whether they are an apprentice, the National Minimum Wage and Living Wages levels as of April 2020 are as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>if a staff member is 25 and over, £8.72 per hour</li>\n \t<li>if a staff member is 21-24, £8.20 per hour</li>\n \t<li>if a staff member is 18-20, £6.45 per hour</li>\n \t<li>if a staff member is 17 or younger, £4.55 per hour</li>\n \t<li>if a staff member is an apprentice, £4.15 per hour</li>\n</ul>\nEmployees are entitled to this rate of pay as a minimum by law. It doesn’t matter if an employer is a small or private company as the legislation applies to any organisation which has employees.\n\nIf an employer draws up a contract of employment which states that a member of staff will receive below the minimum wage, this isn’t legally binding. The Government’s Minimum Wage would override the employment contract essentially nulling the relevant term in the agreement.\n<h2>Who is entitled to receive the Minimum Wage?</h2>\nEmployees must be at least old enough to leave school to benefit from the Minimum Wage. Other individuals who also qualify for the Minimum Wage include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>full time workers</li>\n \t<li>part time workers</li>\n \t<li>casual staff</li>\n \t<li>agency workers and temps</li>\n \t<li>people who work from home</li>\n \t<li>apprentices (entitled to the current apprentice rate – see below for more information)</li>\n \t<li>trainees and workers still on probation</li>\n \t<li>disabled members of staff</li>\n \t<li>agricultural and farm workers</li>\n \t<li>workers from overseas</li>\n \t<li>offshore workers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Apprentice workers’ wages</h2>\nIf you employ apprentices, the National Minimum Wage is applied slightly different. This is because you have to consider other rules when setting a level of pay – for example, if the apprentice in question is under 19, they qualify to receive the minimum apprenticeship wage.\n\nIf the apprentice is over 19, they are then entitled to the correct National Minimum Wage for their age group after they have successfully completed their first year of their apprenticeship.\n<h2>Who does not qualify to receive the National Minimum Wage?</h2>\nThere are some people who do not qualify for either the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage. They are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>if you are self-employed or run your own business or company</li>\n \t<li>company directors of a business</li>\n \t<li>workers who are under the school leaving age (normally 16)</li>\n \t<li>individuals who work on a government programme, for example the ‘Work Programme’ or on a pre-apprentice government scheme</li>\n \t<li>if you are a member of the armed forces such as the Army or the Navy</li>\n \t<li>voluntary workers or volunteers</li>\n \t<li>if you are a higher or further education student completing work experience or a work placement for up to 1 year</li>\n \t<li>family members of the employer who live in the employer’s home</li>\n \t<li>if you are shadowing someone at a place of work</li>\n \t<li>non-family members who live in their employer’s house, share work and leisure activities, and are not charged for meals or accommodation (for example, au pairs)</li>\n \t<li>young people on EU schemes such as Erasmus+, Leonardo da Vinci, or Comenius</li>\n \t<li>prisoners</li>\n \t<li>share fishermen</li>\n \t<li>individuals working on a Jobcentre Plus Work Trial for up to 6 weeks</li>\n \t<li>if you are living and working within a religious community</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Guidance for employers and paying the UK Minimum Wage:</h2>\nEmployers are legally obliged to pay staff correctly. You must by law pay your staff the minimum wage or more for which they qualify.\n\nHowever, there are some payments which you should not include when you’re calculating the minimum wage.\n\nThese things are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>extra pay for unsocial hours during shift work</li>\n \t<li>tips, service charges, and cover charges</li>\n \t<li>items the worker has purchased for the job and for which they are not reimbursed such as uniform, safety equipment and tools</li>\n \t<li>if the employer has paid for travel to work</li>\n</ul>\nFurther considerations you should take into account, but which do not affect the payment of minimum wages:\n<ul>\n \t<li>income tax payments and National Insurance contributions</li>\n \t<li>wage loans or advances for a staff member</li>\n \t<li>the repayment of overpaid wages from a staff member</li>\n \t<li>meals or food for the staff</li>\n \t<li>accommodation for workers if provided by the employer above the offset rate (either £8.20 per day or £57.40 per week)</li>\n \t<li>any penalty charges a worker incurs due to misconduct</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is the difference between National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage?</h2>\nThe main difference between the two scheme is the age of the employees which each covers.\n\nThe Living Wage was introduced in 2016 by the Government with its <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage\">target being to reach 66% of median earnings by 2024</a>.\n<h2>How does the Real Living Wage differ?</h2>\nThe Real Living Wage’s <a href=\"https://www.turn2us.org.uk/About-Us/News/Could-you-live-off-the-minimum-wage\">calculations suggest</a> that being paid at the current levels set for the Minimum Wage and the standard Living Wage allows for staff in receipt of either to comfortably meet their monthly bills including for basic needs like food or rent.\n\nBusinesses involved in the scheme volunteer to pay their staff the <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage\">real Living Wage</a> despite their being no legal obligation to do so. Currently, nearly 6,000 UK businesses choose to pay their staff the real Living Wage.\n\nEmployers including ITV, Google, Everton FC, Chelsea FC, IKEA, and other FTSE 100 companies are members of the scheme and their participation has been verified and certified by the Living Wage Foundation. As a result, 180,000 employees now benefit from the scheme and many of these employers use the Real Living Wage logo on their website and it forms part of their wider programme for corporate social responsibility.\n\nThe real Living Wage currently stands at £9.30 per hour for the UK with the London weighting rate coming in at £10.75 per hour.\n<h2>What should you pay your staff?</h2>\nWe know that every business is different and that most employers want their staff to be happy with the wages they receive for the work they do.\n\nDeciding on the level of wages to pay is difficult because you, as the owner, have to make sure that the reward you receive for employing people is commensurate with the risk you’re taking in doing so.\n\nWhen deciding the levels of wages, you set, key considerations include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>How much value do they add to the business? We appreciate that this is much harder to gauge with non-revenue-generating staff but try to examine how much company service levels or operational efficiency would be affected by someone’s absence to try to calculate a monetary value.</li>\n \t<li>What is the average wage of someone performing that role locally? It’s then a commercial decision for you about whether you wish to pay at that level, pay lower, or pay higher.</li>\n \t<li>What is the average wage of someone performing that role at a competitor? Your competitor(s) and you are fighting for market share so what would you need to offer promising talent to work for you instead?</li>\n \t<li>Could you pay lower but incentivise staff with bonuses for hitting profitability targets?</li>\n</ul>\nPlease contact us at Black and White Accounting with any questions or queries you have on the UK Minimum and Living Wage scheme as well as for constructive advice and feedback on your current wage structure.\n\nWe have been helping clients for over 20 years and we offer a free hour-long consultation to discuss the structuring or legislation around paying staff, for any new clients.\n\nOur advice is confidential as well as being up to date with current laws and information.\n\nCall our team today on freephone 0800 140 4644 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a>.",

      "content": "<h1>6 signs it’s time to grow your business</h1>\nI read an article in <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/why-most-businesses-never-reach-1m-turnover/\">City AM</a> recently that reminded me of many of the clients I’ve had the pleasure of working with over the last two decades here at Black and White Accounting. Only 1 in 25 companies set up in the UK reach a turnover of £1m. Only one in 250 reach a turnover of £10m.<!--more-->\n\nAccording to the article, it would take a £500,000 turnover business to reach the magical £1,000,000 turnover level at an annual growth rate of 3% per annum. In her engaging article, journalist Emma Haslett says that “many business owners find themselves trapped” in a cycle where growth is barely keeping pace with inflation.\n\nThe great question here is why? Emma’s belief, a belief I share, is that there is a fear among entrepreneurs about growth and about the increased responsibility. For many business owners, it’s daunting enough walking into their premises with their mind on the the thought that I have to find the wages at the end of the month for these 10 people. Imagine the feeling of walking through larger premises with the knowledge that 100 people (and their families) are dependent on you making more right decisions than wrong ones.\n\nThese fears are very real and very genuine. The important thing to remember however is that Premier League footballers, Grand Slam tennis players, and stadium rock stars didn’t get to where they got to without help. Why should you,  be any different?\n\nYou see a lot as an accountant. A proactive accountant – something I’ve always prided myself on being – is like the person who gives directions to the driver in a motor rally. The driver is in full control but, at critical moments, my job is to spot both opportunities to save time and hazards which could knock us right out of the race.\n\nAnd it’s in that spirit as the direction giver in the rally car that is your business, I wanted to share my thoughts about the six signs I see in any business which tell me it’s time for that company to grow.\n<h2>Sign 1 - your turnover is predictable</h2>\nYou’ve probably been running your business now for at least 2 years. You’ve gone through the immense learning curve that all company owners go through when you realise that being in charge means a lot more than just being good at servicing customers – there’s a whole other side to being the boss.\n\nYou’ve learned to manage your time a lot better and, sometimes with your heart in your mouth, you’ve taken a leap into the dark and you’ve employed other people to start to take the workload away from you. You’re still working for the business but now you also feel like you’re working on the business at the same time.\n\nThe experiments you’ve carried out into generating more revenue and servicing customers better and faster has now started to turn into your company’s “system” – your <em>modus operandi</em>. You’ve got comfortable with it and so have your staff. They know what you expect of them and they know what to expect of you.\n\nEverything seems very stable now – including you. The extreme emotional and financial highs and lows of the first year are slowly becoming a memory and you feel like the shield which surrounds you has grown greatly in strength. You’re much better able to cope with unexpected events that ever before.\n\nAll of this has combined to create a company capable of generating stable revenues every month. They may vary slightly or there may be a slight upward trend, but you and your staff are now not panicked wondering where the next sale is going to come from.\n<h2>Sign 2 - your profit margins are creeping up</h2>\nYou’ve also noticed that, as revenues have stabilised, you’re now making more money on the work that you did than 12 months ago.\n\nYour profit margins are creeping higher – some of this increased profit may find its way into your bank account as dividends, some of it on low-level business improvements, and some of it on modest pay increases for your colleagues.\n\nThe person who started the business because of a passion to provide a superior product or service to customers is still there but, inside, you feel like more of a businessperson whose job it is to quality control your staff to make sure that they’re still reaching your high standards.\n<h2>Sign 3 - the same customers keep coming back and asking for more</h2>\nYou might have stepped away completely or partially from fulfilment, but you’ve done it in such a way that your clients haven’t noticed any drop in your standards.\n\nSo much so that word of mouth is spreading. Of course, you run your own advertising and marketing campaigns and this is still (and always be) the most successful way to bring in new customers. But those customers, however you found them, continue to come back and they continue to recommend your products and services to others.\n\nYou find that you’re getting requests from the customers to provide more products and services to them because they’d rather you do what it is they want because yours is a company they can trust. And, in their minds, there are too few of those types of businesses about these days.\n<h2>Sign 4 - Sometimes, though, you struggle to cope with demand</h2>\nYou’re really good at predicting levels of demand for your products and services so you know to make sure that, when you need it, there is extra stock or capacity available.\n\nYou’re noticing though that, when demand spikes, you run out of room either to stock the products you need to stock or find the extra labour needed to do the job.\n\nIn fact, although you greatly enjoy running your business most of the time, these spikes are the only real thing that causes you stress now. The stress is caused not by a worry that you won’t be able to service your customers but that you won’t be able to service them as well as they expect.\n<h2>Sign 5 - the post-VAT cash continues to climb</h2>\nThere are two ways to look at VAT and both are equally as valid:\n<ul>\n \t<li>you have to find a significant amount of money on a particular day every three months to pay HMRC and it’s a pain in the a*se</li>\n \t<li>it’s like a three-month interest-free loan from the government.</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you first registered for and paid VAT, it felt like the former. Now it feels like the latter because turnover and profitability are so predictable that you know that there’s no chance that you’re not going to be able to pay it off in full and on time. You might even use a bit of the VAT to experiment on something new from time to time you feel that confident about payment.\n\nAnd every three months (except, sometimes, for those quarters where your corporation tax goes out), the amount of standing cash you have in your bank account continues to grow.\n<h2>Sign 6 - You feel hungry for success – it gnaws away at you</h2>\nYou like the fact that you’re making a decent return from a growing set of loyal customers but, in the back of your mind, you’re worried that you’re becoming complacent. You know the financial ebbs and flows of your business and you know that everything could be put in jeopardy with a sustained period of depressed turnover.\n\nYou like the fact that the cash in your account continues to get larger after you’ve settled the VAT. Perhaps you’ve opened a savings account but, no matter how hard you try, you can’t get excited at earning 0.05% interest on your deposit.\n\nFor a little while now, you feel that you’ve got this pretty much right but is this all there is? Is there nothing more? You know that you’re comfortable and that your business is built on strong foundations, but you also feel that you can do even more.\n\nAnd that feeling starts to turn into something else – frustration and dissatisfaction. Frustration and dissatisfaction at something which gave you so much pleasure not so long ago.\n<h2>If this is you, what do you do now?</h2>\nFirst thing’s first, you’re probably ready to grow and to become one of the 25 who grows their business past the £1,000,000 turnover level.\n\nThis is a risk you’re thinking of taking – a big risk. If you decide to do this, the shield that you’ve built up around you will weaken substantially and you’ll feel prone to the extreme highs and lows that characterised the early days of your entrepreneurial career.\n\nBut is it worth it? YES!\n\nWhy? At the moment, you are the business despite the fact that you might delegate many of your previous responsibilities to others. If you get expansion right, the business will turn into its own living and breathing entity independent of you. While you might pine occasionally for the early days when you were needed, nostalgia is overrated.\n\nYou’ll have financial freedom like you’ve never had before. You’ll know that you’ve created something of value and worth – an army of people walking into the premises you tell them to walk into and who do the things your managers tell them to do all the time earning you money.\n\nPlease believe me when I say that some of my happiest customers run £100,000 a year businesses. In fact, most of my customers are happy but none are as happy as those earning a great living from a company which doesn’t need them anymore.\n<h2>You will need help – and here’s why</h2>\nThe person that you were and are now may not have the skills and experience needed to scale a business without making costly errors on the way. I mean absolutely no offence when I say that but running a company from one premises with 10 members of staff is a lot easier than running 10 offices with 10 staff each in them. I remember when we went from one office to two – I turned grey in six months because I was inexperienced at that time.\n\nEvery step you take needs planning to the <em>n</em>th degree. In an ideal world, you will have experienced accountants forensically examining your financial situation prior to expansion to help you understand what you can afford to do and when. Expanding a business always costs a lot more and takes a lot longer than you budget for and it’s always safer to build a business with significant margins of error at every stage.\n\nTalk to us here at Black and White Accounting. Over the last 20 years or so, the team here, with 160 years’ combined experience between them, have helped dozens of clients through this stage – even bringing in outside experts to help when necessary.\n\nMeet with us for an hour.

      "content": "<h1>Taking on an apprentice</h1>\nAs if young people didn’t have it hard enough. Just over a decade ago, the career prospects of many of Britain’s youngest and brightest were dealt a severe blow by the Great Recession and its prolonged aftermath. Now, in 2020, a new generation has to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and this is truly unchartered territory.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nMany companies’ bank accounts will have been drained by the lockdown, but they still have to trade – they have to navigate their way out of this. This may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the young people in our country as employers seek to train them at a much lower cost rather than recruiting experienced personnel instead.\n\nThe most obvious route for companies choosing this approach will be the apprenticeship system.\n\nIn this article, we’ll consider the positive arguments in favour of recruiting apprentices and training them up from scratch. We’ll examine:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the commercial and operational benefits of taking on apprentices</li>\n \t<li>the costs of the apprenticeship scheme</li>\n \t<li>how to sign up for the scheme</li>\n \t<li>budgeting for welcoming apprentices</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The commercial and operational benefits of taking on apprentices</h2>\nYoung people may now select from over 1,500 courses spread across 170 business sectors. The number of courses continues to grow as inventive and adaptable apprentice training and recruitment companies build their educational courses around the needs and demands of employers and the interests and skills of apprentices.\n\nAside gaining an extra body at a temporarily discounted rate to do work in your company, what other benefits will they bring?\n<h3>Teach and learn from your apprentice</h3>\nYour apprentice must be given time to complete their coursework and their study when on the job – most apprentice recruitment agencies recommend setting aside at least one day of the week for this.\n\nThere will be parts of your apprentice’s course which bear little or no relation to the operational or commercial needs of your business although most of it will.\n\nHowever, the knowledge gained by your apprentice on topics your business does not normally concern itself with may deliver wider benefits to your company – your apprentice may make you aware of commercial opportunities that you can exploit with your existing infrastructure and your apprentice’s knowledge which you were unaware of before.\n<h3>The energy of youth and the return on investment</h3>\nParticularly in the post COVID-19 world, all employees will want to prove their worth to their employers to better ensure the likelihood of them being retained for the future. At least your existing staff already have a foot in the door – a motivated, headstrong young member of staff who wants to work and who wants to earn knows that they have to work hard to earn and keep their place within your organisation.\n\nWe’ve all worked for and run companies where a team or a department has been shaken up in a positive way with the arrival of a new member of staff or a new manager who has a different approach. Your apprentice will have the same effect once they have found their feet and they have found mentors they can rely on to look after them.\n\nAn apprentice is a blank canvass – unsullied with the way things were done at their previous employers and unconcerned with anything other than fitting in, proving their worth, and earning their keep.\n\nReports demonstrate that the presence of an apprentice adds the equivalent of £214 productivity per week to a business – 72% of employers reported better company-wide productivity following the establishment of an apprenticeship programme.\n\nAccording to recent statistics, apprentices are far more likely to stay with you longer than employees you recruited through other routes too.\n<h3>Corporate social responsibility</h3>\nMany employers use the fact that they run an apprenticeship programme as part of their corporate social responsibility programme.\n\nIt’s a way of demonstrating that your company is giving back and a way of tying it to the fortunes of the local community. You’re offering career paths to young people in the area – this is particularly valuable if you are located in a post-industrial area which hasn’t managed to shake off the financial and psychological effects of deindustrialisation.\n\nRecent research also found that, when selecting suppliers, many businesses would be more likely to choose a partner with an active apprenticeship programme.\n<h2>The costs of an apprenticeship scheme</h2>\nThe current apprenticeship minimum wage is £4.15 an hour. This is minimum wage for apprentices under the age of 19 or over the age of 19 during the first year of their apprenticeship.\n\nIn the second year and later of their apprenticeship assuming that they are 19, they must receive the National Minimum Wage for their age group.\n\nThis is currently:\n<ul>\n \t<li>£8.72 per hour if 25 or over</li>\n \t<li>£8.20 per hour if 21 to 24</li>\n \t<li>£6.45 per hour if 18 to 20</li>\n \t<li>£4.55 per hour if 17 or younger</li>\n</ul>\nThere are two important conditions you must adhere to when employing an apprentice:\n<ul>\n \t<li>they must work for at least 30 hours a week</li>\n \t<li>they must receive the same in-work benefits as every other employee</li>\n</ul>\nThere is a cost to the course taken by your apprenticeship to which you must pay 5% - the government funds the rest.\n\nThe 5% levy is waved for employers with fewer than 50 staff if you hire an apprentice between the ages of 16 and 18 or an apprentice between the age of 19 and 24 with an Education, Health and Care plan provided by their local authority.\n\nAll employers receive a £1,000 bonus for hiring an apprentice between the ages of 16 and 18 or an apprentice between the age of 19 and 24 with an Education, Health and Care plan provided by their local authority. The first half is paid in the third month and the second half in the twelfth month.\n\nFor all apprentices under the age of 25, you do not have to pay National Insurance Employers’ Contributions on their salaries.\n\nIf your company’s annual wage bill is £3,000,000 a year or more, you must by law set aside 0.5% of that to pay the Apprenticeship Levy. The money paid by a company for the Apprenticeship Levy can be used to fund its own apprentice program.\n<h2>How to start an apprenticeship programme</h2>\nYour apprenticeship program may be one person, or you may choose to recruit 10. Whatever you want, get in touch with a local apprenticeship recruiter first – start <a href=\"https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employer/find-apprenticeship-training\">here</a>.\n\nDiscuss with your provider the level of qualification you want your apprentice to study for – you can choose from:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Intermediate – Level 2 </strong>(equivalent to the educational level of 5 passes at GCSE, Grades A-C</li>\n \t<li><strong>Advanced – Level 3 </strong>(equivalent to the educational level of 2 A-Level passes)</li>\n \t<li><strong>Higher – Levels 4, 5, 6, and 7</strong> (equivalent to the educational level of foundation degree and above)</li>\n</ul>\nThere is flexibility in the system – if you have a particularly ambitious apprentice, some providers offer Advanced Level courses as an optional module.\n<h2>Budgeting for an apprentice</h2>\nAn apprentice’s wage is an additional fixed cost. They’re also not like other new employees in that they have to be supervised – for most, this is their first experience of the working world and there will be some dramas along the way.\n\nCan you afford it? Will an apprentice add value to your business? Before you give the Apprenticeship Service a call, get in touch with us and we can work out both the indirect and direct costs of hiring an apprentice and what value they may deliver back to your company in return.\n\nCall our team today on freephone 0800 140 4644 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a>.",

      "content": "The tax code on our own pay slips as directors and on our employees’ pay slips are used by employers, accountants, payroll processing companies, and pension providers to work out the level of income tax and National Insurance deductions when paying salaries.\n\nAccording to our research, hundreds of thousands of people a year in the UK search the Internet for help in understanding what the tax codes on their wage slips mean – there is genuine confusion out there. Although HMRC do a reasonably good job in explaining the tax system as clearly as possible, they are hampered by the fact that the UK tax code is so dense and complicated in the first place.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIf quantum physics were easy, why would the late great Stephen Hawking need an entire book to explain it? That’s the position that HMRC’s outreach team finds themselves in too.\n\nIn this article, we cover:\n<ul>\n \t<li>what an employee’s tax code should be</li>\n \t<li>how PAYE codes are worked out</li>\n \t<li>the tax code for basic rate payers</li>\n \t<li>what the 0T tax code is</li>\n \t<li>tax codes and the Marriage Allowance</li>\n \t<li>tax codes for people earning over £100,000 a year</li>\n \t<li>the emergency tax code</li>\n \t<li>how your tax code changes if you owe money to HMRC</li>\n \t<li>the tax code for people with more than one job</li>\n \t<li>taxpayer codes in Scotland</li>\n \t<li>help with payroll from Black and White Accounting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What should an employee’s tax code be?</h2>\nYour employee can check the tax code they’re on by using the interactive tool on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-income-tax-current-year\">HMRC website</a>.\n\nThe millions of people in the UK who complete a self-assessment form annually however cannot use this tool at time of writing.\n<h2>How are PAYE codes worked out?</h2>\nWhen working out which code to apply to an employee, HMRC considers:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the tax-free allowance a person is entitled to</li>\n \t<li>any income earned on which tax has not been paid</li>\n \t<li>any benefits in kind you have receive on which tax has not been paid</li>\n</ul>\nIncome which you’ve not paid tax on is then removed from your personal allowance – what remains is a person’s actually tax-free allowance for the year.\n\nYour personal allowance is included within your tax code, albeit with the last digit missing. If, because of tax not paid on other earnings or benefits-in-kind, your personal allowance was reduced from £12,500 to £11,000, the number shown on your PAYE code would be 1100.\n<h2>The tax code for basic rate payers</h2>\nFor basic rate taxpayers, the PAYE code is 1250L for employees.\n\nYou should assume until told otherwise by HMRC that this is the code to use for all members of staff.\n<h2>What is the 0T tax code?</h2>\nIf an employee has no personal allowance because it has all been used up, the tax code on their payslip will be “0T”.\n\nHowever, many employers and their accountants, when waiting for the standard information an employee provides when they begin working for you, assign a 0T code to a new staff member as a temporary measure.\n<h2>Tax codes and the Marriage Allowance</h2>\nIntroduced in 2016, the Marriage Allowance allows an employee earning less than £12,500 (or whatever the personal allowance is that year) to transfer £1,250 of their personal allowance to their spouse or civil partner as long as they are a basic rate taxpayer (earning £12,501 to £50,000 per annum).\n\nYou can encourage your staff to take advantage of the Marriage Allowance by applying for it online <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-marriage-allowance\">here</a>.\n\nWhen a couple takes part in the scheme, “M” will show after the numbers in the tax code of higher earner and “N” for the lower earner.\n<h2>Tax codes for people earning over £100,000 a year</h2>\nOnce a person begins earning £100,000 or more, the letter in their tax code is “T”. At this time, your employee loses £1 from their personal allowance for every £2 above £100,000 they earn. Once their income has passed £123,000, they are no longer in receipt of a personal allowance.\n<h2>The mysterious emergency tax code – what is it?</h2>\nIf you don’t use the “0T” tax code when an employee has started with you, they may be assigned an emergency tax code. The same is true of people returning to salaried work after a period of being self-employed, of staff receiving company benefits, and of staff in receipt of the State Pension.\n\nEmergency tax codes are not meant to be permanent. As soon as you have the information you need from a new or affected staff member to apply the correct tax code, you can do so by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-codes/updating-tax-code\">clicking here</a>.\n\nEmergency tax codes in 2020/2021 are 1250 W1, 1250 M1, and 1250 X.\n<h2>How the tax code changes if you’re in arrears to HMRC</h2>\nHMRC collects money owed to it from taxpayers through the PAYE system. If instructed, you must make these deductions from an employee’s salary.\n\nAnnual repayments are subject to a maximum limit depending on annual earning and the current scale is…\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\"><strong>Employee's PAYE earnings</strong></td>\n<td width=\"38%\"><strong>Maximum annual tax repayment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">Up to £29,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£3,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">£30,000-£39,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">£40,000-£49,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£7,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">£50,000-£59,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">£60,000-£69,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£11,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">£70,000-£79,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£13,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">£80,000-£89,999.99</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"60%\">Above £90,000</td>\n<td width=\"38%\">£17,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe repayment of debt, called “coding out” by HMRC, in this case would mean that you would have to withhold up to £15,000 from a member of staff if they earned between £80,000-£89,999.99. You then transfer the repayment to HMRC on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of each month together with your standard transfer of income tax and both forms of NI.\n\nYou are more likely to encounter this situation if a member of staff has started working for you after a period of self-employment.\n<h2>More than one job? Tax codes</h2>\nFor employees with two or more jobs at different employers, standard tax codes are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>BR (basic rate taxpayer)</li>\n \t<li>D0 (higher rate taxpayer)</li>\n \t<li>BR (additional rate taxpayer)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Taxpayers in Scotland and Wales</h2>\nFor taxpayers paying the Scottish version of income tax, their tax code is prefixed with an “S”.\n\nScottish income tax differs quite markedly from income tax in the rest of the UK -\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Tax band name</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Scottish bands</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Applicable income tax rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Tax band name</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Rest of UK bands</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Applicable income tax rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Personal allowance</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">Up to £12,500</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">0%</td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Personal allowance</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">Up to £12,500</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Starter rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">£12,501 to £14,585</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">19%</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\" width=\"16%\"><strong>Basic rate</strong></td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\" width=\"16%\">£12,501 to £50,000</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\" width=\"16%\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Basic rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">£14,586 to £25,158</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Intermediate rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">£25,159 to £43,430</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">21%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Higher rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">£43,431 to £150,000</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">41%</td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Higher rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">£50,001 to £150,000</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Top rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">Over £150,000</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">46%</td>\n<td width=\"16%\"><strong>Additional rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"16%\">Over £150,000</td>\n<td width=\"16%\">45%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThere is also a Welsh version of income tax however the bands are the same as in England and Northern Ireland. Welsh taxpayers’ tax codes are prefixed with a “C”.\n<h2>Payroll and more from Black and White Accounting</h2>\nPayroll is one of the more complicated tax calculation and deduction obligations placed on employers. It’s one of the easiest to make repeated mistakes on and, if an employer does make repeated mistakes, the compound effect of those mistakes will result in a likely fine from HMRC on top of repayment of any accumulated shortfall.\n\nCall our team today on freephone 0800 140 4644 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a> to discuss your current payroll arrangements to see if we can provide any assistance.",

      "content": "A clear and well-thought-out business plan is a significant asset to any company although, regrettably, most business owners who take the time needed to write one forget about it soon afterwards.\n\nGiven how much time, effort, and brain space running a company takes up though, it’s not surprising that it gets pushed to the back of the queue especially when work is coming in and you’re having to put out internal fires.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nA business plan contains the information you need on whether your company is performing to target or not – are you doing as well as you want to? After all, it’s you who wrote the business plan and it’s you who decided on the financial and operational milestones contained within it.\n\nGood business plans should reflect your business and the world it operates in – it should include information and insight on:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the industry you are operating in – are you doing better than your competitors?</li>\n \t<li>your sales and marketing plans and how effective they are</li>\n \t<li>your finances and goals for growth – are you achieving them?</li>\n \t<li>personnel and staffing – do you have the right team around you?</li>\n \t<li>operating procedures – are your internal operations as efficient and do they leave as little room for error as possible?</li>\n \t<li>geographical considerations and property – too much or too little space? Are you in the right location?</li>\n \t<li>chain of supply – what if a key supplier ceases trading? Do you have back-ups? And are the relationships you have with back-up suppliers as strong as they need to be?</li>\n</ul>\nA solid business plan is a specific and highly detailed document which clearly communicates the company goals and your operating strengths and weakness so that you, other senior managers, and investors know where the company is at now and where it wants to be.\n\nThe presence of a plan provides comfort to employees and investors – more than anyone, your staff and outside investors need to feel like someone is in control and that they know what they’re doing.\n\nIn this article, we cover the 5 main areas that any comprehensive business plan should cover. It isn’t complicated to compose a business plan, but it does require time and effort for it to truly deliver results.\n\nWe recommend including these five sections at a minimum to create a valuable tool you can continue to refer to ensure that your business is reaching its true potential.\n<h2>The Executive Summary</h2>\nThis is your “big picture”.\n\nThis is an overview of your entire business as it is now and how it will develop and grow in the future – in precise detail. Generally speaking, it should be 1 to 2 pages long – but no more than that.\n\nDescribing the path, you intend to take in a clear and concise way will ensure that you, other readers, and investors understand the direction of travel and that everyone has an idea of what is expected of them on that journey.\n\nUse your executive summary to outline the current and future operation and goals of every area of the business – for example, department structures, the management of cash flow, the allocation of resources and stocking levels, marketing plans, accounting conventions, research and development aims, recruitment policies, and so on.\n\nBe brief here as you will be going into much more detail about these areas in the relevant sections of your plan later on.\n<h2>The execution</h2>\nHow are you going to do it?\n\nOnce you have outlined your main goals, the next step is to delve deeper into how exactly you are going to achieve them.\n\nAn effective business plan always includes a detailed sales and marketing plan – how much will it cost to find a new lead and to convert a new customer? Marketing is essential for any business and no business will survive without targeted and sustained exposure to their desired client base. If no-one knows your business exists, how will you make any sales?\n\nYou need to decide whether you will need to use/keep sales reps, the role of the internet in your advertising, whether direct marketing is an appropriate route to market and how to structure it, which geographical regions you’re servicing, and much more.\n\nWhat about service levels? Are you adequately coping with demands servicing customers when needed before, during, and after the sale? Many businesses don’t want to compete on price – we understand that – so you need to decide on what the differentiator for your business is and push it hard. You need to meet and exceed customer expectations – what are your plans for doing so?\n\nIs your internal structure helping or hindering you? Are there too many steps in a process involving too many people? Remove wastage and you increase profitability and response times.\n\nGetting more out of the staff that you have now in terms of revenue and profitability means that you are going to have to remove roadblocks from within the business that are preventing  them getting to where you want them to get to now. Have you spoken with your staff to find out where problems are occurring within the business and asked them what they need to hit the goals you want them to hit?\n\nGetting from where you are now to where you want to be requires a root-and-branch review of every aspect of your business. Knowing how to get there is half the task – the other half is to provide staff with what they need and to be able to measure their performance along the way, making slight alterations if you have to.\n<h2>The Team</h2>\nWho do you need to succeed?\n\nPeople make your business what it is. Particularly if you’re going to be seeking funding, investors need to know what talent you have within your company and how you are best going to use them.\n\nA driven team with clear strengths and individual goals is arguably the most valuable asset a business has. A directionless team with no targets to aim for is a liability.\n\nKnowing in detail the skills and talent that each member of staff has to offer is important as is knowing which areas of weakness need to be addresses.\n\nDo you need additional people to help you achieve your target? Or can you do it more cheaply and give pay rises along with additional responsibilities to your existing members of staff without affecting service levels?\n\nYou’re going to need your team to achieve your goals. Give them the power, the flexibility, the training, and the rewards they need to help them deliver for you.\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\nWhat are your current financials like? Are you profitable or lossmaking? Do you have a healthy cash flow and good gross profit margins?\n\nA sales forecast is essential as is your cash flow and your income statement – otherwise known as your profit and loss – as well as your balance sheet.\n\nThe more detail you can include in your financial plan, the better. Make sure to include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>your fixed costs – make sure that every item of expenditure delivers value back to your company</li>\n \t<li>current loans and debts – can you pay them down faster to reduce your fixed costs?</li>\n \t<li>plant, machinery, and equipment – do they aid or hinder capacity or quality of production? Do you need new machinery to keep up or to increase the number of orders you can fulfil</li>\n</ul>\nAccountants normally recommend that you predict sales and profitability on a month by month basis for the first year of trading a plan covers then every quarter of the following 2 years, respectively.\n\nThis is definitely true however you should update your business plan every 12 months and break down monthly sales and profitability for the year ahead.\n<h2>Competition for your customers</h2>\nWho are you up against and who are you selling to? Who is your target customer and who are they already buying from?\n\nWhichever industry you are in, you need to research the other companies in your sector who are targeting the same customers as you do.\n\nLet’s say you are in the motor trade. You will need to find out who else is selling similar cars in the same geographical location as you and at what prices. You need to find out who is buying these cars and why they’re choosing your competitors over you? Is it the range of cars? Is it the price point? Is it the offer of an extended warranty? Could it be their website and the fact that they advertise on bigger platforms for greater exposure?\n\nBy researching the competition and finding out what it is about them which makes them appealing to the customer base you’re targeting, you are also able to compare your own strengths and weaknesses. It’s a good idea to spend considerable time mapping out the product, services, and marketing plans of your competition to see where you can improve but also to see where you already really stand out.\n<h2>Help with your business plan</h2>\nHere at Black and White Accounting we are an established accountancy and business planning firm with over 20 years’ experience.

      "content": "When is a claimable allowance not a claimable allowance? When HMRC says so. One of the finest lines which many accountants have to be careful not to cross is making sure that every expense we claim back on behalf of a client either in a personal or a business context is allowable. And we’re sure you believe us when we say that it’s genuinely not always as straight forward as it sounds.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe wanted to share with you in an article not only the main types of expenses which we can legitimately claim back on your behalf but also those when there is an element of judgement required.\n\nIn this article, we consider:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the standard expenses you can claim back</li>\n \t<li>is work clothing claimable?</li>\n \t<li>are IT expenses claimable</li>\n \t<li>the annual entertainment allowance</li>\n \t<li>legal fees</li>\n \t<li>costs incurred when working from home</li>\n \t<li>the Annual Investment Allowance</li>\n \t<li>using an accountant to make sure you pay no more tax than you need to</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Standard expenses you can claim</h2>\nThe straightforward definition of “profitability” is the difference between what you’ve sold and all of the expenses you incurred in making those sales. Those costs may be stock, wage costs, rental or mortgage costs for your company’s premises, advertising, marketing, delivery, telecommunications, and so on.\n\nBut what is a legitimate expense? By HMRC’s definition, it’s something which is purchased for use “wholly and exclusively” by a business. If something is purchased which could be and is used for both business and personal reasons, whether it is an allowable expense or not is not always easy to determine.\n<h3>Is work clothing claimable?</h3>\nHMRC’s definition of a uniform is \"a set of clothing of a specialised nature that is recognisable as a uniform and is intended to identify its wearer as having a particular occupation” (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim32475\">HMRC EIM32475</a>).\n\nStandard work uniform on a construction site like steel-toe-capped boots and fluorescent helmets would qualify because they are “wholly and exclusively” necessary for the context. Likewise, a uniform you purchase for a member of staff which would ever only be worn when the employee is performing his or her duty meets the “wholly and exclusively” criteria.\n\nGeneral clothing you purchase for staff members must be included on the P11d form – the form used to report non-monetary expenses and benefits you’ve provided to your employees. With uniforms and protective clothing however, you don’t need to include them on a staff member’s P11d form because they are considered as exempt.\n\nWhich items of clothing would be exempt? Exempt clothing includes any clothing which could be worn for personal reasons as well as for business reasons. HMRC cites the example of someone purchase a formal evening dress to receive an award – this would not qualify because that dress may be worn for social occasions as well as for award evenings.\n<h3>Are IT expense claimable?</h3>\nHMRC will generally allow any expenditure under £500 as claimable revenue expenditure. For hardware and software costing more than £500, we would normally class this as capital expenditure (which doesn’t reduce your level of taxation).\n\nWhere confusion may arise is for the purchase of a piece of equipment like a laptop which may be used for both personal and professional reasons. Unless you can prove that it’s only ever going to be used for professional reasons (virtually impossible), we would recommend you:\n<ul>\n \t<li>pay National Insurance Employer’s Contributions on the value of the laptop if you run a limited company or</li>\n \t<li>claim it as a benefit-in-kind if you’re a sole trader.</li>\n</ul>\nFor sole traders, this means that you’ll have to pay equivalent income tax on the purchase. So, if you are a basic rate taxpayer and the laptop costs £1,000, keep aside £200 for income tax.\n<h3>The annual entertainment allowance</h3>\nFor directors of a limited company, you’re entitled to £300 worth of treats every year. These treats must not be monetary payments and no treat must cost more than £50. These treats are not subject to income tax or NI payments.\n\nFor members of staff, you have a £150 annual entertainment allowance per head (on which you can reclaim the VAT). The £150 may be spend on food, drink, travel, hotel stays, and so on. If you spend more than £150 per head, the entire amount spent becomes liable for tax and NI so please be careful.\n\nWe’re certain that you know this anyway, but you can’t claim business lunches to celebrate the clinching of a significant new deal.\n<h3>Legal fees</h3>\nLegal fees are allowable if you spend them on doing something which directly benefits the company like involving solicitors in trade disputes, lease renewal negotiations, rent reviews, employment advice, and debt collection. These transactions would be classed as revenue expenditure.\n\nLegal fees however are not allowable if, even for the benefit of the company, you use solicitors to acquire a new lease, buy property, or merge with or acquire another company. These transactions would be classed as capital expenditure.\n<h2>Annual Investment Allowance</h2>\nWe’ve touched a couple of times in this article about revenue expenditure and capital expenditure. Revenue expenditure can be used to reduce accounting profitability and therefore the level of tax you pay whereas capital expenditure may not.\n\nCertain types of capital expenditure are allowable however when your company purchases:\n<ul>\n \t<li>expenditure incurred in plant and machinery demolition</li>\n \t<li>fixtures including but not limited to bathroom suites and fitted kitchens</li>\n \t<li>goods, services, and labour linked to a building’s ‘integral features’</li>\n \t<li>goods, services, and labour relating to building alterations required to install other plant and machinery within your premises</li>\n \t<li>items that you retain exclusively for the use of your business</li>\n</ul>\nUntil 31st December 2020, you can spend up to £1m on these items of expenditure and claim them back as if they were revenue expenditure under the Annual Investment Allowance scheme.\n<h2>Pay no more in tax than you need to with Black &amp; White Accounting</h2>\nBlack and White Accounting’s clients benefit from paying just the correct amount of tax on their personal or company earnings because we make sure that every allowable expense is included and claimed for.\n\nWhile individual claims may be small, over the course of a year they often accumulate into a not inconsiderable sum and it’s always better to have that money in your bank account than the Exchequer’s.\n\nWe’re offering a one hour’s free consultation with new clients – we can come to yours or you can come to ours (or we can do a Zoom call if you’re reading this in the era of social distancing). Let us find out about what personal and professional financial success means to you – we’ll put together a suggested package of services for you at a fixed monthly cost which we believe will add the greatest value to your business.\n\nCall our team today on freephone 0800 140 4644 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk\">hello@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk</a>.",

      "content": "With fifty thousand people presented with huge and unexpected tax bills and an argument over the retrospective nature of the charge, the loan charge fiasco has been a situation with tragic consequences. What is it? Are you affected? And can Black and White Accounting help?\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Tax avoidance or devastating misunderstanding?</h2>\nFrom HMRC’s perspective, this situation has quite clearly been a tax avoidance scheme. For many of those caught up in it however, including a large number of contractors and low-paid agency workers, it is a confusing misunderstanding that came from nowhere.\n\nTax avoidance schemes are typically associated with the very rich, so how is it that people struggling to feed their families have become part of this problem?\n<h2>The story of loan-based tax avoidance</h2>\nLaws on tax are typically very tight, but some unscrupulous accountants make their fortunes by closely examining the fine print of the law and finding the holes in the rules.  Knowing that their actions are not necessarily within the jurisdiction of the law, but by following the wording means, that they can offer solutions that closer represent tax avoidance than the true representation of the correct procedures.\n\nMorality, however, is far from objective!\n<h3>Being paid with a loan</h3>\nThe loan charge comes from a particular scheme where rather than having income declared as a payment from an employer or client, it was declared as a loan and thus untaxed.\n\nThese ‘loans’ then had a repayment policy which effectively put them never needing to be repaid - a ‘perfect’ way to move money from a company to an individual without incurring income tax or national insurance.\n\nAnd technically legal.\n\nThe scheme became widespread at the end of the 1990s and was used by many companies in the early 2000s. Of particular note were umbrella companies and agencies, who were able to offer their contractors and staff a very favourable tax situation through use of the system.\n<h3>HMRC’s response</h3>\nIt took many years before HMRC did anything about this particular tax avoidance scheme. The first legislation put in place to try to combat the problem occurred in 2011, but it wasn’t until 2017 that it was fully in force.\n\nThose who had benefitted from the scheme were billed for unpaid tax with a deadline of April 2019 - an unforeseen bill that ran into thousands of pounds for even the lowest-earning victim. Although HMRC offered payment schemes that could run for years to those who came forward before the deadline, the financial impact on affected families was considerable.\n\nThe legislation rolled back to 1999, putting some people in the position of finding themselves billed for two full decades of underpaid tax.\n<h3>The controversy</h3>\nBecause HMRC were charging people stretching back almost twenty years before the law came into force, it was seen as a retrospective charge. Many argue that the idea that HMRC can change the rules on tax extending into the past and then charge for back-payment accordingly is outside of the law and simply not right.\n\nOn the other side of the argument, HMRC maintain that it isn’t retrospective, but retroactive; meaning that the scheme was always one of avoidance and never properly within the law at the time.\n\nIt becomes a more reaching argument due to the wide range of people affected. With employees, agency workers and contractors on low incomes all hit with debilitating levels of tax debt, the retroactive nature of the rules is seen as morally unfair. This is further reinforced due to tragic incidents - at least four known cases of suicide have been recorded as a direct consequence of people being unable to face the financial devastation of the April 2019 bill.\n<h2>The Sir Amyas Morse Review</h2>\nCampaigners put pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson early in 2019 to stop the loan charge. Consequently, a full review led by the former Chief Executive of the National Audit Office, Sir Amyas Morse, was undertaken. Those protesting the charge were hoping that it will lead to a full cancellation of the charge and release tens of thousands of people from unexpected debt.\n\nThe review was completed and published by the government in January 2020 with some benefits for those affected.\n\nAll but one of Sir Amyas Morse’s recommendations were taken on board by HMRC, helping ease some of the burden on those facing enormous tax bills.\n<h3>Halving the ‘look back’ period</h3>\nThe review recommended that the loan charge should not apply to loans entered into before 9th December 2010. This effectively cut the 20-year retroactive change to a 10-year one.\n\nThis will not constitute a change in circumstances for anyone who used the scheme post 2010 but will help a great many people who were victims of the situation in the years between 1999 and 2010.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that it does not mean that any tax due on earlier loans is completely written off, and it is important that you still seek professional financial advice if this change affects you.\n<h3>Exemption of reasonably disclosed loans</h3>\nThis review recommendation stated that if the taxpayer disclosed to HMRC that they were using a loan scheme on their tax return, and no action was taken, that the loan should be considered outside the scope of the loan charge.\n\nThis applies to loans taken out between 9th December 2010, and 5th April 2016.\n\nIn essence, this means that if you gave enough information on your tax return that HMRC could identify and understand the nature of the loan arrangements, yet did nothing to follow that up (by opening an enquiry, for example), that such loans should no longer be covered by the loan charge.\n\nAgain, if this affects you, it is important to clarify your situation with professional financial advice.\n<h3>Refunds of settlements</h3>\nThis next recommendation dictated that HMRC should refund any settlements that were already given (through ‘voluntary restitution’) if the loan now falls outside of the loan charge due to the previous two recommendations.\n\nThe government note that HMRC will not be able to process any refunds until changes to the loan charge legislation have been enacted by Parliament.’\n<h3>Spreading the loan balance</h3>\nIn order to mitigate the impact of the tax payments, Sir Amyas Morse recommended that the outstanding loan balances be optionally split over three years.\n\nThis could be very beneficial for those on lower incomes. Previously, the entire balance of the loan would be added to any income for the year, likely pushing anyone on the basic rate of tax into the higher rate and meaning that much of the loan tax was calculated at 40%. By splitting the balance over three years, it will often be that the adjusted taxable balance remains at the basic tax rate, ensuring only a 20% tax on the loan balance.\n\nIn some cases, this could halve the tax due.\n\nSpeak to Black and White Accounting for help in calculating your tax if you believe these changes could help you.\n<h3>Avoiding hardship and bankruptcy</h3>\nOne key recommendation was that no one subjected to the loan charge should have to pay more than half of their disposable income per year, and that no one should have to sell their home or use their pension to pay the bill.\n\nHMRC have confirmed that they will ‘not seek bankruptcy proceedings for individuals who have engaged with  HMRC, competed an affordability assessment, and are solely unable to pay the loan charge’.\n\nIn short, this reduces many of the  loan charge fears, reassuring those affected that their homes, pensions and basic living standards are safe. It is clear, however, that these reassurances are only in place for those willing to actively engage with HMRC, and that any type of avoidance is not recommended.\n\nAn additional review recommendation regarding payment terms means that those earning under £50,000 per year will automatically be entitled to a minimum of a five-year payment plan (seven years if under £30,000 p.a.).\n\nThis doesn’t mean other payment plans aren’t available for all individuals - HMRC are always willing to look at bespoke payment plans based on an income and expenditure assessment - but it guarantees such plans for those earning less than £50,000.\n<h2>The loan charge deadline</h2>\nThe deadline for filing a tax return for those with loan charge related issues has also been extended to 30th September 2020 (a change from the previously set 31st January 2020). This provides some breathing room to bring your accounts in order and set up any needed payment plans between now and the end of September.\n\nHMRC have confirmed that they will waive any penalties for late filing and late payment, and that no late payment interest will be added, provided that the return is filed and payment made (or an arrangement put in place) by 30th September 2020.\n<h2>If you are affected by the loan charge</h2>\nIt is important that if you have a current payment plan with HMRC that you continue to make payments as arranged until any new assessment has been completed and replacement arrangements made.\n\nAt Black and White Accounting, we are available to help you with advice and are able to contact HMRC on your behalf to make things easier. Give us a call!\n<h2>Avoiding avoidance</h2>\nMaking sure that you follow the correct tax laws and pay your tax and national insurance on time is a key part of both personal and corporate financial management. If you are self-employed, a contractor, an agency worker or the director of a company, then it’s important that you have a trusted accountant to work with you.\n\nAt Black and White Accounting, we can look at your tax with a professional and experienced eye, saving you where it is proper and appropriate and never steering you into any morally grey area!

While dormant company status can greatly reduce the effort and cost involved in maintaining the company, there will still be some time and expenditure required.\n<h3>What do I need to do for my trading company to become dormant?</h3>\nTo make an existing trading company dormant, you should:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Pay any outstanding bills and cancel any business contracts. These might, for example, include leases of buildings or equipment, insurance, utilities, telephone and internet services previously used.</li>\n \t<li>Reconcile the amounts you’re due to receive from your customers and ensure you’ve received all expected payments. You’ll need to terminate any agreements with customers to provide goods and services.</li>\n \t<li>If applicable, pay any outstanding VAT due to HMRC and (usually) cancel the company’s VAT registration.</li>\n \t<li>Pay any final wages due to employees and close the company’s payroll scheme.</li>\n \t<li>It’s usually sensible to close down the company’s business bank account(s). A specific requirement to remain dormant is that the company must not receive any interest payments so any interest bearing account certainly needs to be closed.</li>\n</ul>\nThe company can only be dormant going forward if no transactions pass through it, with <a title=\"What is a dormant company?\" href=\"https://www.informdirect.co.uk/business-finance/dormant-company-definition-and-requirements/\">very few exceptions as to which transactions are allowed</a>. While tidying up all the above details might be time-consuming, it will provide something of a clean break. If, for example, you decide instead to continue paying for utilities or insurance, the company won’t be dormant in HMRC’s eyes and you’ll have to continue to file normal accounts.\n<h3>How do I tell HMRC my company is now dormant?</h3>\nTo confirm with HMRC, you’ll need to write to your local Corporation Tax Office stating the date on which the company became or will become dormant. Their contact details will be on correspondence from HMRC.\n\nHMRC will then send to your <a href=\"https://www.informdirect.co.uk/company-records/registered-office-address-what-is-it/\">registered office address</a> a ‘Notice to deliver a Company Tax Return’. This covers the period of business immediately before the company became dormant. You’ll need to complete and file the return and make a payment of any tax the company owes.\n\nHMRC will usually confirm your dormant status in writing within about three weeks. From the date your company becomes dormant, HMRC will stop treating your company as active – this means that you won’t receive a lot of the correspondence from them you’ve had until now. In most cases, you also won’t need to contact HMRC until the company begins trading again (or you choose to dissolve it).\n<h3>What about telling Companies House?</h3>\nYou do not have to inform Companies House that your company is dormant until it is time to submit your <a href=\"https://www.informdirect.co.uk/company-records/filing-company-accounts-your-questions-answered/\">annual accounts</a>. Remember that full accounts for the period up to the start of dormancy will need to be filed as usual. For the first full accounting period for which the company is dormant, however, you’ll instead need to submit simplified dormant company accounts to Companies House within nine months of the company’s accounting reference date.  That can greatly reduce the administration of maintaining the company and is the reason many people make their companies dormant.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, dormant companies must continue to meet a number of other Companies House filing obligations, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The annual <a href=\"https://www.informdirect.co.uk/confirmation-statements/confirmation-statement-companies-house-what-is-it/\">confirmation statement</a>, which is entirely different and separate from the accounts</li>\n \t<li>When a new director or company secretary is appointed or terminated (or they change certain details like their name or service address), an appropriate form must be submitted.</li>\n \t<li>Changes to the company’s registered office address or, if one exists, a <a title=\"Set SAIL for somewhere to keep statutory records\" href=\"https://www.informdirect.co.uk/company-records/statutory-records-sail-address/\">SAIL address</a> must be submitted on the appropriate form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What if the dormant company then becomes active again?</h3>\nMost dormant companies will become active again at some point in their lives. If your company become active (for example, by starting to trade), you must notify HMRC within three months. The easiest way is to use HMRC’s <a href=\"https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/options?GAURI=\">online registration service</a> to inform them that the company is now active.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

      "content": "Cryptoassets are a relatively new type of asset that have become more prevalent in recent years. New technology has led to cryptoassets being created in a wide range of forms and for various different uses.\nThis paper sets out HMRC’s view - based on the law as it stands at the date of publication – about how individuals who have cryptoassets are taxed. It does not explicitly consider the tax treatment of cryptoassets held for the purposes of a business carried on by an individual.\nThe cryptoassets sector is fast-moving and developing all the time. The terminology, types of coins, tokens and transactions can vary. The tax treatment of cryptoassets continues to develop due to the evolving nature of the underlying technology and the areas in which cryptoassets are used. As such, HMRC will look at the facts of each case and apply the relevant tax provisions according to what has actually taken place (rather than by reference to terminology). Our views may evolve further as the sector develops.\nWhere HMRC considers that there is, or may have been, avoidance of tax, the analysis presented will not necessarily apply.\nFind out about tax treatment of businesses with cryptoassets.\n\nWhat cryptoassets are\n\nCryptoassets (or ‘cryptocurrency’ as they are also known) are cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual rights that can be:\n\ntransferred\n\nstored\n\ntraded electronically\n\nWhile all cryptoassets use some form of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) not all applications of DLT involve cryptoassets.\nHMRC does not consider cryptoassets to be currency or money. This reflects the position previously set out by the Cryptoasset Taskforce report . They have identified 3 types of cryptoassets:\n\nexchange tokens\n\nutility tokens\n\nsecurity tokens\n\nHowever the tax treatment of all types of tokens is dependent on the nature and use of the token and not the definition of the token.\nThis paper considers the taxation of exchange tokens (like bitcoins) and does not specifically consider utility or security tokens. For utility and security tokens this guidance provides our starting principles but a different tax treatment may need to be adopted.\n\nExchange tokens\n\nExchange tokens are intended to be used as a method of payment and encompasses ‘cryptocurrencies’ like bitcoin. They utilise DLT and typically there is no person, group or asset underpinning these, instead the value exists based on its use as a means of exchange or investment. Unlike utility or security tokens, they do not provide any rights or access to goods or services.\n\nUtility tokens\n\nUtility tokens provide the holder with access to particular goods or services on a platform usually using DLT. A business or group of businesses will normally issue the tokens and commit to accepting the tokens as payment for the particular goods or services in question.\n\nSecurity tokens\n\nSecurity tokens may provide the holder with particular interests in a business, for example in the nature of debt due by the business or a share of profits in the business.\n\nWhich taxes apply\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, individuals hold cryptoassets as a personal investment, usually for capital appreciation in its value or to make particular purchases. They will be liable to pay Capital Gains Tax when they dispose of their cryptoassets.\nIndividuals will be liable to pay Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on cryptoassets which they receive from:\n\ntheir employer as a form of non-cash payment\n\nmining, transaction confirmation or airdrops\n\nAs set out in more detail below, there may be cases where the individual is running a business which is carrying on a financial trade in cryptoassets and will therefore have taxable trading profits. This is likely to be unusual, but in such cases Income Tax would take priority over the Capital Gains Tax rules.\nHMRC does not consider the buying and selling of cryptoassets to be the same as gambling.\n\nThe location of exchange tokens\n\nThis section is primarily for non-domiciled individuals calculating their tax liability on the remittance basis and for related Inheritance Tax purposes.\nHMRC considers that throughout the time an individual is UK resident, the exchange tokens they hold as beneficial owner will be located in the UK.\nHMRC has considered other possibilities, but at this stage in the development of these tokens has found that a residence basis most accurately fits the majority of transactions.\nThis means a person who holds exchanges tokens is liable to pay UK tax if they are a UK resident and carry out a transaction with their tokens which is subject to UK tax.\n\nDetermining the location of exchange tokens\n\nWhen considering the location of an intangible asset, the courts will generally look at the nature of the asset to find a suitable comparison.\nFor Capital Gains Tax, sections 275 and 275A of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 provide statutory rules for determining when particular types of assets will be in the UK, but these are unlikely to apply to exchange tokens in most cases. It is HMRC’s view that:\n\nexchange tokens have an economic value as they can be ‘turned to account’ - for example, exchanging them for goods, services, fiat currency (that is money declared by a government to be legal tender) or other tokens\n\nexchange tokens are a new type of intangible asset (different to other types of intangible assets, such as shares or debentures)\n\nthe only identifiable party to consider is the beneficial owner of the exchange token\n\nFor Inheritance Tax, common law is relevant to the extent that Double Taxation Agreements do not determine the location (section 158 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984).\nUsing the residency of the beneficial owner of the exchange tokens to determine the location gives a clear, logical, predictable and objective rule which can be easily applied.\nIf an exchange token is co-owned between 2 or more beneficial owners then section 275C Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 applies (for Capital Gains Tax). Each beneficial owner’s interest in the asset will be where that beneficial owner is resident. If one or more of the co-owners are UK resident, this will not affect the location for those co-owners who are not UK residents.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nFinancial trading in cryptoassets\n\nHMRC taxes cryptoassets based on what the person holding it does. If the holder is conducting a trade then Income Tax will be applied to their trading profits.\nOnly in exceptional circumstances would HMRC expect individuals to buy and sell cryptoassets with such frequency, level of organisation and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade in itself. If it is considered to be trading then Income Tax will take priority over Capital Gains Tax and will apply to profits (or losses) as it would be considered as a business.\nAs with any activity, the question whether cryptoasset activities amount to trading depends on a number of factors and the individual circumstances. Whether an individual is engaged in a financial trade through the activity of buying and selling cryptoassets will ultimately be a question of fact. It’s often the case that individuals and companies entering into transactions consisting of buying and selling cryptoassets will describe them as ‘trades’. However, the use of the term ‘trade’ in this context is not sufficient to be regarded as a financial trade for tax purposes.\nA trade in cryptoassets would be similar in nature to a trade in shares, securities and other financial products. Therefore the approach to be taken in determining whether a trade is being conducted or not would also be similar, and guidance can be drawn from the existing case law on trading in shares and securities.\nMore information on the existing approach and case law for share transactions and financial traders can be found in the HMRC business income manual (BIM56800).\n\nMining\n\nCryptoassets can be awarded to ‘miners’ for verifying additions to the blockchain digital ledger. Mining will typically involve using computers to solve difficult maths problems in order to generate new cryptoassets.\nWhether such activity amounts to a taxable trade (with the cryptoassets as trade receipts) depends on a range of factors such as:\n\ndegree of activity\n\norganisation\n\nrisk\n\ncommerciality\n\nIf the mining activity does not amount to a trade, the pound sterling value (at the time of receipt) of any cryptoassets awarded for successful mining will be taxable as income (miscellaneous income) with any appropriate expenses reducing the amount chargeable.\nThe other taxable income: HS325 Self Assessment helpsheet has more information about miscellaneous income.\nIf the individual keeps the awarded assets, they may have to pay Capital Gains Tax when they later dispose of them.\n\nFees from mining\n\nFees or rewards received in return for mining (for transaction confirmation) are also chargeable to Income Tax, either as trading or miscellaneous income depending on the:\n\ndegree of activity\n\norganisation\n\nrisk\n\ncommerciality\n\nIf the individual receives cryptoassets as payment for the services provided then any increase in value from the time of acquisition will either give rise to a chargeable gain on disposal for Capital Gains Tax purposes or, in the case of a trade, get taken into account in computing any trading profits\n\nAirdrops\n\nAn airdrop is where someone receives an allocation of tokens or other cryptoassets, for example as part of a marketing or advertising campaign in which people are selected to receive them. Other examples of airdrops may involve tokens being provided automatically due to other tokens being held or where an individual has registered to become eligible to take part in the airdrop.\nThe airdropped tokens, typically, has its own infrastructure (which may include a smart contract, blockchain or other form of DLT) that operates independently of the infrastructure for an existing cryptoasset.\nIncome Tax will not always apply to airdropped cryptoassets received in a personal capacity. Income tax may not apply if they’re received:\n\nwithout doing anything in return (for example, not related to any service or other conditions)\n\nnot as part of a trade or business involving cryptoassets or mining\n\nAirdrops that are provided in return for, or in expectation of, a service are subject to Income Tax either as:\n\nmiscellaneous income\n\nreceipts of an existing trade\n\nThe disposal of a cryptoasset received through an airdrop may result in a chargeable gain for Capital Gains Tax, even if it’s not chargeable to Income Tax when it’s received. Where changes in value get brought into account as part of a computation of trade profits Income Tax will take priority over Capital Gains Tax.\n\nIncome Tax losses\n\nAn individual who is trading may be able to reduce their Income Tax liability by offsetting any losses from their trade against future profits or other income. HMRC’s Losses: HS227 Self Assessment helpsheet has more information (including restrictions that apply).\nIf profits from activities are taxable as miscellaneous income, losses may be able to be carried forward to later years. More information on this can be found in helpsheet HS325: other taxable income.\n\nCapital Gains Tax\n\nHMRC would expect that buying and selling of cryptoassets by an individual will normally amount to investment activity (rather than a trade of dealing in cryptoassets). In such cases, if an individual invests in cryptoassets they will typically have to pay Capital Gains Tax on any gains they realise.\nCryptoassets are digital and therefore intangible, but count as a ‘chargeable asset’ for Capital Gains Tax if they’re both:\n\ncapable of being owned\n\nhave a value that can be realised\n\nWhat constitutes a ‘disposal’\n\nIndividuals need to calculate their gain or loss when they dispose of their cryptoassets to find out whether they need to pay Capital Gains Tax. A ‘disposal’ is a broad concept and includes:\n\nselling cryptoassets for money\n\nexchanging cryptoassets for a different type of cryptoasset\n\nusing cryptoassets to pay for goods or services\n\ngiving away cryptoassets to another person\n\nIf cryptoassets are given away to another person who is not a spouse or civil partner, the individual must work out the pound sterling value of what has been given away. For Capital Gains Tax purposes the individual is treated as having received that amount of pound sterling even if they did not actually receive anything.\nIf Income Tax has been charged on the value of the tokens received, section 37 Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 will apply. Any consideration will be reduced by the amount already subject to Income Tax.\nIf an individual donates cryptoassets to charity, they will not have to pay Capital Gains Tax on them. This does not apply:\n\nif they make a ‘tainted donation’\n\nwhere the individual disposes of the cryptoassets to the charity for more than the acquisition cost so that they realise a gain\n\nAllowable costs\n\nCertain costs can be allowed as a deduction when calculating if there’s a gain or loss, which include:\n\nthe consideration (in pound sterling) originally paid for the asset\n\ntransaction fees paid before the transaction is added to a blockchain\n\nadvertising for a purchaser or a vendor\n\nprofessional costs to draw up a contract for the acquisition or disposal of the cryptoassets\n\ncosts of making a valuation or apportionment to be able to calculate gains or losses\n\nThe following do not constitute allowable costs for Capital Gains Tax purposes:\n\nany costs deducted against profits for Income Tax\n\ncosts for mining activities (for example equipment and electricity)\n\nCosts for mining activities do not count toward allowable costs because they’re not wholly and exclusively to acquire the cryptoassets, and so cannot satisfy the requirements of section 38(1)(a) Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 (but it is possible to deduct some of these costs against profits for Income Tax or on a disposal of the mining equipment itself).\nIf the mining amounts to a trade for tax purposes the cryptoassets will initially form part of trading stock. If these cryptoassets are transferred out of trading stock, the business will be treated as if they bought them at the value used in trading accounts. Businesses should use this value as an allowable cost in calculations when they dispose of the cryptoassets. More information can be found in the HMRC Capital Gains manual (CG69220).\n\nPooling\n\nPooling under section 104 Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 allows for simpler Capital Gains Tax calculations. Pooling applies to shares and securities of companies and also “any other assets where they are of a nature to be dealt in without identifying the particular assets disposed of or acquired”. HMRC believes cryptoassets fall within this description, meaning they must be pooled.\nInstead of tracking the gain or loss for each transaction individually, each type of cryptoasset is kept in a ‘pool’. The consideration (in pound sterling) originally paid for the tokens goes into the pool to create the ‘pooled allowable cost’.\nFor example, if a person owns bitcoin, ether and litecoin they would have 3 pools and each one would have it’s own ‘pooled allowable cost’ associated with it. This pooled allowable cost changes as more tokens of that particular type are acquired and disposed of.\nIf some of the tokens from pool are sold, this is considered a ‘part-disposal’. A corresponding proportion of the pooled allowable costs would be deducted when calculating the gain or loss.\nIndividuals must still keep a record of the amount spent on each type of cryptoasset, as well as the pooled allowable cost of each pool.\n\nExample\n\nVictoria bought 100 token A for £1,000. A year later Victoria bought a further 50 token A for £125,000. Victoria is treated as having a single pool of 150 of token A and total allowable costs of £126,000.\nA few years later Victoria sells 50 of her token A for £300,000. Victoria will be allowed to deduct a proportion of the pooled allowable costs when working out her gain:\nAmountConsideration £300,000Less allowable costs£126,000 x (50 / 150)£42,000Gain £258,000\nVictoria will have a gain of £258,000 and she will need to pay Capital Gains Tax on this. After the sale, Victoria will be treated as having a single pool of 100 token A and total allowable costs of £84,000.\nIf Victoria then sold all 100 of her remaining token A then she can deduct all £84,000 of allowable costs when working out her gain.\n\nAcquiring within 30 days of selling\n\nSpecial pooling rules apply if an individual acquires tokens of a cryptoasset:\n\non the same day that they dispose tokens of the same cryptoasset (even if the disposal took place before the acquisition)\n\nwithin 30 days after they disposed of tokens of the same cryptoasset\n\nIf the special rules apply, the new cryptoassets and the costs of acquiring them stay separate from the main pool. The gain or loss should be calculated using the costs of the new tokens of the cryptoasset that are kept separate.\nIf the number of tokens disposed of exceeds the number of new tokens acquired, then the calculation of any gain or loss may also include an appropriate proportion of the pooled allowable cost.\n\nExample\n\nMelanie holds 14,000 token B in a pool. She spent a total of £200,000 acquiring them, which is her pooled allowable cost.\nOn 30 August 2018 Melanie sells 4,000 tokens B for £160,000.\nThen on 11 September 2018 Melanie buys 500 token B for £17,500.\nThe 500 new tokens were bought within 30 days of the disposal, so they do not go into the pool. Instead, Melanie is treated as having sold:\n\nthe 500 tokens she has just bought\n\n3,500 of the tokens already in the pool\n\nMelanie will need to work out her gain on the 500 token B as follows:\nAmountConsideration£160,000 x (500 / 4,000)£20,000Less allowable costs £17,500Gain £2,500\nMelanie will also need to work out her gain on the 3,500 token B sold from the pool as follows:\nAmountConsideration£160,000 x (3,500 / 4,000)£140,000Less allowable costs£200,000 x (3,500 / 14,000)£50,000Gain £90,000\nMelanie still holds a pool of 10,500 token B. The pool has allowable costs of £150,000 remaining.\n\nBlockchain forks\n\nSome cryptoassets are not controlled by a central body or person, but operate by consensus amongst that cryptoasset’s community. When a significant minority of the community want to do something different they may create a ‘fork’ in the blockchain.\nThere are two types of forks, a soft fork and a hard fork. A soft fork updates the protocol and is intended to be adopted by all. No new tokens, or blockchain, are expected to be created. A hard fork is different and can result in new tokens coming into existence. Before the fork occurs there is a single blockchain. Usually, at the point of the hard fork a second branch (and therefore a new cryptoasset) is created.\nThe blockchain for the original and the new cryptoassets have a shared history up to the fork. If an individual held tokens of the cryptoasset on the original blockchain they will, usually, hold an equal numbers of tokens on both blockchains after the fork.\nThe value of the new cryptoassets is derived from the original cryptoassets already held by the individual. This means that section 43 Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 will apply.\nAfter the fork the new cryptoassets need to go into their own pool. Any allowable costs for pooling of the original cryptoassets are split between the pool for the:\n\noriginal cryptoassets\n\nnew cryptoassets\n\nIf an individual holds cryptoassets through an exchange, the exchange will make a choice whether to recognise the new cryptoassets created by the fork.\nNew cryptoassets can only be disposed of if the exchange recognises the new cryptoassets. If the exchange does not recognise the new cryptoasset it does not change the position for the blockchain, which will show an individual as owning units of the new cryptoasset. HMRC will consider cases of difficulty as they arise.\nCosts must be split on a just and reasonable basis under section 52(4) Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992. HMRC does not prescribe any particular apportionment method. HMRC has the power to enquire into an apportionment method that it believes is not just and reasonable.\n\nAirdrops\n\nAn airdrop is when an individual receives an allocation of tokens or other cryptoassets. For example, tokens are given as part of a marketing or advertising campaign.\nThe airdropped cryptoasset, typically, has its own infrastructure (which may include a smart contract, blockchain or other form of DLT) that operates independently of the infrastructure for an existing cryptoasset.\nThe tokens of the airdropped cryptoasset will need to go into their own pool unless the recipient already holds tokens of that cryptoasset, in which case the airdropped tokens will go into the existing pool. The value of the airdropped cryptoasset does not derive from an existing cryptoasset held by the individual, so section 43 Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 does not apply.\n\nCapital Gains Tax losses\n\nIf an individual disposes of cryptoassets for less than their allowable costs, they will have a loss. Certain ‘allowable losses’ can be used to reduce the overall gain, but the losses must be reported to HMRC first.\nThere are special rules for losses when disposing of cryptoassets to a ‘connected person’.\n\nClaiming for an asset that’s lost its value\n\nAs with other types of assets, individuals can crystallise losses for cryptoassets that they still own if they become worthless or of ‘negligible value’.\nA negligible value claim treats the cryptoassets as being disposed of and re-acquired at an amount stated in the claim. As cryptoassets are pooled, the negligible value claim needs to be made in respect of the whole pool, not the individual tokens.\nThe claim will need to state the:\n\nasset which is the subject of the claim\n\namount the asset should be treated as disposed of (which may be £0)\n\ndate that the asset should be treated as disposed of\n\nThe disposal produces a loss that needs to be reported to HMRC. Negligible value claims can be made to HMRC at the same time as reporting the loss.\nMore information about negligible value claims can be found in the HMRC Capital Gains manual (CG13120P).\n\nLosing public and private keys\n\nIf an individual misplaces their private key (for example throwing away the piece of paper it is printed on), they will not be able to access the cryptoasset. The private key still exists as part of the cryptography, albeit it is not known to the owner any more. Similarly the cryptoassets will still exist in the distributed ledger. This means that misplacing the key does not count as a disposal for Capital Gains Tax purposes. More information can be found in the HMRC Capital Gains manual (CG13155).\n\nCryptoassets received as earnings\n\nCryptoassets received as employment income count as ‘moneys worth’ and are subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on the value of the asset.\n\nCryptoassets provided in the form of Readily Convertible Assets (RCAs)\n\nCryptoassets are RCAs if trading arrangements exist, or are likely to come into existence, in accordance with section 702 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.\nExchange tokens like bitcoin can be exchanged on one or more token exchanges in order to obtain an amount of money. On that basis, it is our view that ‘trading arrangements’ exist, or are likely to come into existence at the point cryptoassets are received as employment income.\nIf an employer has a UK tax presence they must deduct and account to HMRC for the Income Tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions due through the operation of PAYE, based on the best estimate that can reasonably be made of the cryptoasset’s value.\nMore information on readily convertible assets can be found in the HMRC employment income manual - (EIM11900).\nIf an employer cannot deduct the full amount of Income Tax due from employment income they must still account to HMRC for the balance. This is called the ‘due amount’. The employee must reimburse their employer for the ‘due amount’ within 90 days after the end of the tax year. If they do not, then a further Income Tax charge and National Insurance contributions liability will arise on an amount equal to the ‘due amount’ under section 222 ITEPA 2003.\nMore information about PAYE: special types of payment can be found in the HMRC employment income manual - (EIM11954).\n\nCryptoassets which are not RCAs\n\nCryptoassets received as earnings from employment, which do not meet the definition of RCAs in section 702 ITEPA 2003, are still subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions.\nEmployers do not have to operate PAYE on payments of earnings that are not RCAs. The individual must declare and pay HMRC the Income Tax due on any amount of employment income received in the form of cryptoassets (using the employment pages of a Self Assessment return). More information on filing a Self Assessment tax return is available.\nThe employer should treat the payment of cryptoassets, which are not RCAs, as payments in kind for National Insurance contributions purposes, and pay any Class 1A National Insurance contributions to HMRC.\n\nCryptoassets provided by a third party in connection with employment\n\nWhere cryptoassets are provided by a third party, in connection with employment, an Income Tax charge may arise under Part 7A ITEPA 2003. A Class 1 National Insurance contributions liability may also arise under Regulation 22B and paragraph 2A of Schedule 3 to the Social Security (contributions) Regulations 2001.\nEmployers must account to HMRC for the Income Tax and National Insurance contributions due through the operation of PAYE, based on the best estimate that can reasonably be made of the cryptoassets’ value.\nMore information on Part 7A ITEPA 2003 can be found in the HMRC employment income manual - (EIM45000).\n\nSubsequent disposal of tokens\n\nAny disposal of the cryptoasset received through employment may result in a chargeable gain for Capital Gains Tax.\n\nRecord keeping\n\nCryptoasset exchanges may only keep records of transactions for a short period, or the exchange may no longer be in existence when an individual completes a tax return.\nThe onus is therefore on the individual to keep separate records for each cryptoasset transaction, and these must include:\n\nthe type of cryptoasset\n\ndate of the transaction\n\nif they were bought or sold\n\nnumber of units\n\nvalue of the transaction in pound sterling\n\ncumulative total of the investment units held\n\nbank statements and wallet addresses, if needed for an enquiry or review\n\nSelf Assessment tax returns\n\nMany cryptoassets (such as bitcoin) are traded on exchanges which do not use pound sterling, so the value of any gain or loss must be converted into pound sterling on the Self Assessment tax return.\nIf the transaction does not have a pound sterling value (for example if bitcoin is exchanged for ripple) an appropriate exchange rate must be established in order to convert the transaction to pound sterling.\nReasonable care should be taken to arrive at an appropriate valuation for the transaction using a consistent methodology. They should also keep records of the valuation methodology.\nThe amount of tax due depends on the individual’s personal circumstances including their residence and domicile status.\n\nOther considerations\n\nPensions\n\nHMRC does not consider cryptoassets to be currency or money so they cannot be used to make a tax relievable contribution to a registered pension scheme.\nMore information on contributions can be found in the HMRC pensions tax manual PTM044100.\n\nInheritance Tax\n\nCryptoassets will be property for the purposes of Inheritance Tax.",

      "content": "The UK is now out of the EU VAT regime and Customs Union from 1 January 2021 following the Brexit transition period. The UK has introduced its new Border Operating Model for the control of imports and exports of goods between the EU and UK excluding Northern Ireland (‘GB’ or ‘Great Britain’).\n\nExporters from the UK should follow the following steps from 1 January 2021...\n\n<!--more-->\n<ol>\n \t<li>Who will export the goods from GB?</li>\n \t<li>Obtain a UK EORI number</li>\n \t<li>Check if you need an export licence</li>\n \t<li>Ensure you are eligible for export VAT exemption</li>\n \t<li>Decide how you will complete export declaration</li>\n \t<li>Information required for your exit declaration</li>\n \t<li>Moving the goods</li>\n \t<li>EU import customs declarations</li>\n \t<li>Completing Intrastat after Brexit</li>\n</ol>\nThese are covered in more detail below.\n<h2>1. Who will export the goods from GB?</h2>\nDetermine who will be the exporter of record and therefore responsible for the UK customs paperwork and export clearance, transport, insurance and other issues relating to the goods movement. This is contained with the in the International Commercial Terms (Incoterms) agreed in the sales contract. Typically, it is the GB supplier. They may also take responsibility of the customs clearance and import VAT for the goods into the EU. This Brexit-popular Incoterms basis is known as Delivered Duty Paid (DDP).\n<h2>2. Obtain a UK EORI number</h2>\nThe exporter will need a UK Economic Operator Registration Identification number from HMRC. This is a unique identification number used on export (and import) paperwork to identify the exporter with customs authorities. UK businesses should already have has this issued from HMRC in preparation for Brexit in 2019; it may be obtained quickly if not. EU businesses acting as the UK exporter may apply to HMRC for one.\n<h2>3. Check if you need an export licence</h2>\nCertain controlled goods require an export licence or certificate. This includes: chemicals; goods; excise goods; livestock and foodstuffs.\n<h2>4. Ensure you are eligible for export VAT exemption</h2>\nExport sales are exempt from UK VAT. However, to be entitled to this relief, the exporter will need proof of the departure of the goods from GB. This could include sales invoice, customs declarations, bill of lading documents and transport documents.\n<h2>5. Decide how you will complete export declaration</h2>\nAs an exporter you may complete customs export declarations and processes yourself, or appoint an intermediary:\n\n5.1 Complete your own customs export process\n\nYou can purchase commercial declarations software\n\nThis will enable you to complete your declarations and file with the UK National Export System (NES).\n\nYou will need to apply to HMRC to register for NES and for a ‘badge’ for HMRC's online customs systems: CDS and CHIEF\n\n&nbsp;\n\n5.2 Use customs intermediary\n\nThe following parties are usually approved by UK HMRC to represent exporters:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Freight forwarders</li>\n \t<li>Customs agent or broker</li>\n \t<li>Fast parcel operators</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>6. Information required for your exit declaration</h2>\nIrrespective of who completes the export paperwork, you will need to compile the following information:\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Commodity code</b> for the product, which identifies the digits that identify a product, its materials and production method. The EU uses the six-digit global Harmonised System, or <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/don-t-get-your-commodity-codes-or-tariffs-wrong.html\">HS Code</a>, and adds a further two digits 'CN heading'.</li>\n \t<li>Departure point and destination</li>\n \t<li>Consignee and consignor</li>\n \t<li>Nature, amount and packaging of the goods</li>\n \t<li>Transport method</li>\n \t<li>Any certificates and licences</li>\n \t<li>An exporter statement of origin to allow your importer to qualify for zero tariffs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Moving the goods</h2>\nYou or your customs intermediary submits the completed customs export declaration to NES for a unique consignment number. This enables you to export the goods from GB and clear customs.\n<h2>8. EU import customs declarations</h2>\nAt the same time, the EU import processes must be completed to ensure your freight forwarder and transport provier will accept the shipment. If supplying on DDP (see above) this will be you. This includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Applying for an EU EORI number. UK importers and exporters into the EU will need a <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/eu-states-enforce-brexit-import-customs-agent-rules.html\">customs intermediary</a> and use their EORI number. This is because they are now non-resident within the EU Customs Union.</li>\n \t<li>Securing any import licence.</li>\n \t<li>Having the exporter's statement of origin to qualify for EU zero tariffs under the '<a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/eu-uk-brexit-preferential-tariffs-and-rules-of-origin.html\">rules of origin</a>' requirements.</li>\n \t<li>Completing EU customs import declarations for the EU member state of import, and this is filed with the relevant country’s customs system</li>\n \t<li>Applying for deferred VAT / Postponed VAT to ensure you do not have to pay import VAT.</li>\n \t<li>If you are clearing the goods, consider an EU VAT registration with <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-services/fiscal-representative-for-eu-vat.html\">Fiscal Representation</a> obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9. Completing Intrastat after Brexit</h2>\nThe UK's HMRC is no longer expecting monthly <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/country-guides/europe/uk/uk-intrastat.html\">Intrastat</a> declarations for the export of goods from GB to EU from 2021. However, movements between <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/uk-intrastat-required-after-brexit--yes-.html\">NI and EU will require Intrastat</a> and imports from EU to GB.\n<h2>Black and White Accounting</h2>\n<div>\n\nThis is a summary guide for individuals and businesses, who are exporting goods from GB to EU from 1 January 2021.

      "content": "With the UK government's tax-free childcare scheme, you could claim up to £2,000 worth of costs per child per year specifically related to childcare. However, only one in six eligible families are taking advantage of the offer and take-up of the scheme among Britain's self-employed and company directors is even lower.\n\nThere are plenty of online guides which offer great advice and support to families on how to claim tax free childcare.\n\nThis is another such article but Black and White Accounting are going to take a slightly different approach with our guide - we're going to focus on families where one or more of the people making a living in a household is self-employed or a company director.\n<h2>What is tax-free childcare?</h2>\nTax-free childcare is a government-run scheme whose purpose is to assist working parents with rapidly-increasing childcare costs.\n\nFor every £8 you pay your childcare provider, the government will top it up by another £2. You can receive up to £2,000 per child per annum up until the age of 12 (or £4,000 per annum for every disabled child up until the age of 17).\n\nThere is a cap on payments from the government of £500 per quarter (or £1,000 for children with disabilities).\n\nThis tax-free childcare payment you may be entitled to receive represents 20% basic tax relief on the first £10,000 worth of childcare costs per child.\n\nIf you or your partner are not working, you may still be eligible for tax-free childcare if you are in receipt of:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the Carer's Allowance or</li>\n \t<li>the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) (previously called the Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Free childcare in the countries of the UK</h2>\nTax-free childcare is not the only scheme of its kind available to parents in Britain.\n\nIn all four countries of the UK, you can claim for 10 or more hours of free pre-school education or free childcare every week.\n<h3>Free childcare in England</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Each child receives 570 free childcare hours per year (parents normally use the service in term time meaning that, over 38 weeks, their children receive 15 hours of care)</li>\n \t<li>If you or your partner earn at least £140 a week but each of you earns less than £100,000 per annum, you may be able to claim for an additional 15 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Free childcare in Scotland</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Every child in Scotland is entitled to 16 hours' worth of free childcare per week</li>\n \t<li>Councils in Scotland are given extra money by the Scottish government to fund further hours of free childcare. Entitlement varies between council regions - click <a href=\"https://www.mygov.scot/childcare-costs-help/funded-early-learning-and-childcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to see how many additional hours your child may receive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Free childcare in Northern Ireland</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>There are no free childcare hours offered in Northern Ireland but pre-school education is funded through the <a href=\"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/pre-school-education-places\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pre-School Education Programme</a> which, for 38 weeks of the year (term time), provides parents either 12.5 or 22.5 hours' worth of tuition a week for their children.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Free childcare in Wales</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>In Wales, the amount of free childcare varies per week depending on your local authority but it will never be less than 10 hours - click <a href=\"https://gov.wales/find-your-local-family-information-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here </a>to see how much each council offers.</li>\n \t<li>Some areas offer up to 30 hours a week, 10 hours of which is made up by early education.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Who is eligible for tax-free childcare?</h2>\nTax-free childcare is available for families meeting the following criteria:\n<ul>\n \t<li>you're a parent to a child who is under 12 years old (or who is under 17 years old with a disability)</li>\n \t<li>you’re under 25 or an apprentice earning the equivalent of 16 hours' work paid at National Minimum Wage or Living Wage levels</li>\n \t<li>you (and your partner if applicable) work and you (both) earn at least the National Minimum Wage or Living Wage for 16 hours a week</li>\n \t<li>you are on paid ordinary or additional maternity, paternity or adoption leave or you are in receipt of Maternity Allowance for another child</li>\n \t<li>you are on paid shared parental leave</li>\n \t<li>you are on sick leave</li>\n \t<li>you are on paid annual leave</li>\n \t<li>you live and work in the UK (excluding Armed Forces personnel posted overseas and other Crown servants)</li>\n \t<li>your child is under 12 years old is disabled and under 17 years old</li>\n</ul>\nYou won't be able to use tax free childcare if you earn more than £100,000 per annum or, in the cases of claims made by homes with two parents present, your household income is greater than £100,000 per annum.\n\nIf you are in receipt of tax credits, Universal Credit, a childcare bursary or grant, or childcare vouchers, you can't claim under the tax-free childcare scheme. If you do make an appliaction and your are successful, any child tax credit or working tax credit you receive will cease immediately.\n\nIf you've been self-employed for less than twelve months, there is no minimum income requirement you need to match to apply for tax free childcare.\n<h3>Coronavirus (COVID 19) and tax-free childcare</h3>\nEligibility to receive tax-free childcare and/or 30 hours' free childcare did not change during the pandemic however HMRC did introduce flexibility to their qualifying criteria on a temporary basis.\n\nHowever, this additional flexibility was withdrawn on 8th January 2021.\n<h2>When do I receive the tax-free childcare money from the government?</h2>\nThe money you receive from the government is paid into a \"tax-free childcare account.\" You pay the childcare providers you choose direct from your tax-free childcare account.\n\nWhenever you pay money into your online childcare account, the government will top it up the same day (normally within two hours).\n\nOther family members and friends can top up your childcare account if they wish.\n<h2>Childcare providers</h2>\nTo qualify for tax-free childcare, the childcare providers you choose must be regulated the ChildCare Register, the Early Years Register, or OFSTED.\n\nMore than 70,000 childcare providers have joined the scheme but please do check that that your chosen provider's application has been approved by the appropriate regulator before you purchase childcare services from them.\n\nThe types of childcare service provider you can use the scheme for include au-pairs, nannies, playgroups, nurseries, childminders, after-school clubs, and breakfast clubs.\n\nSome holiday camps also accept vouchers as do art, football, and tennis clubs. Childcare provided by home care workers is also eligible as long as they work for a registered home care agency.\n<h2>Tax-free childcare - most frequently asked questions</h2>\n<h3>What's the best thing to do for households whose joint income is £40,000 a year or less?</h3>\nIf you work (or you both work if you're in a couple) and you're paying for childcare, you should consider claiming up to 85% of your childcare costs back through Universal Credit instead of using the tax-free childcare scheme.\n\nUniversal Credit recipients can claim back up to £646.35 a month for one child or £1,108.40 monthly for two or more children. You may wish to take advice on this from us before making a decision or, if you'd prefer, the Childcare Service Helpline can provide you with advice.\n<h3>Should you choose childcare vouchers or tax free childcare?</h3>\nTax-free childcare was brought in to replace childcare vouchers - this scheme is still ongoing however it has been closed to new applicants since October 2018.\n\nChildcare vouchers were offered by employers for children up to the age of 15 (16 if disabled). Unlike the tax-free childcare scheme, there is no minimum or maximum earning limit.\n\nChildcare vouchers are generally better for smaller families with lower childcare costs. If you run a business and your partner is on the payroll of another firm, it may be worth your partner checking to see if their employer still issues childcare vouchers. If they do, get in touch with us and give us details of their scheme and we'll be able to run costed examples for you.\n<h3>What will happen to the current childcare vouchers scheme?</h3>\nThe likelihood is that the childcare vouchers scheme will end in around 2034 when disabled children born in 2018 reach the age of 16.\n<h3>What about tax-free childcare for single parents?</h3>\nYou can apply for tax-free childcare as a single parent although only one childcare account can be set up per child.\n\nIf the other parent wishes to contribute, then they will need to pay into their child's online childcare account.\n<h3>What about tax-free children if I'm on sick, annual, maternity, paternity, shared parental, or adoption leave?</h3>\nYou can apply for tax free childcare under these circumstances but:\n<ul>\n \t<li>you can't claim for 30 hours' free childcare for a child you're currently on shared parental or adoption leave to look after and</li>\n \t<li>you won't receive tax-free childcare for a child you're currently on shared parental or adoption leave to look after until 31 days after you've gone back to work.</li>\n</ul>\nRegarding older children, you can claim tax-free childcare if you're not currently on shared parental or adoption leave. You may also qualify for Contributory Employment And Support Allowance or Carer's Allowance whether your partner is working or not.\n<h3>How often do you need to complete the eligibility criteria form?</h3>\nYou need to confirm your eligibility for tax-free childcare every three months by using your online child service account.\n\nIf nothing has changed in the intervening three months, you simply need to tick the appropriate box. You should also be sent a reminder to your personal email address four weeks before you have to re-confirm your eligibility.\n<h3>What happens if my claim does not meet the necessary eligibility criteria?</h3>\nIf you no long meet the eligibility criteria, you may be able to retain your 30 hours' free childcare for a short space of time depending on your childcare provider's policies.\n<h2>Help with tax free childcare for the self-employed and for company directors</h2>\nBeing a parent is difficult - being a parent with responsibility for running a business is every harder.\n\nMany benefits schemes are created without the self-employed and company directors in mind - we only have to think back to the coronavirus crisis to see that.\n\nHowever, 30 hours' free childcare and tax-free childcare are available to both the self-employed and to company directors. You've paid into the system for years and you're entitled to receive these benefits so, if you're eligible, you should make full use of them.\n\nTo speak with one of the Black and White team on how to claim tax free childcare, call us on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here to email us</a> for more information.",

      "content": "Tax codes are used by employers and pension providers to work out how much tax they should deduct from your job or pension before the money arrives in your bank account.\n\nEach source of income you benefit from, whether from a job or pension, will have its own tax code so it's important to make sure that you check them all.\n\nIn this article, the team at Black and White Accounting explains everything you need to know about the tax codes for every job or pension you earn income from as well as how to contact HMRC if you think you're on the wrong code or if you think you've overpaid or underpaid your tax.\n<h3>Who has a tax code?</h3>\nAll full- or part-time employee who receive their wages via the PAYE system must have tax code. People in receipt of private pensions also have a tax code.\n\nPeople who are self-employed, unemployed, or in receipt ONLY of a state pension do not have a tax code.\n<h3>Where can I find my tax code?</h3>\nIf you don't know which code you're on for a particular job or pension, you can find it either on:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>your payslip</strong> - the notification you receive from your employer every time you're paid your wages,</li>\n \t<li><strong>your P45</strong> - the form an employer gives you when you stop working from them,</li>\n \t<li><strong>your P60</strong> - your employer's annual summary of your salary and the amount deducted for tax,</li>\n \t<li><strong>pension advice slip</strong> - for employees paying in to a private pension,</li>\n \t<li><strong>PAYE coding notice </strong>(sometimes called a P2) - HMRC's explanation of how your tax code was generated (usually sent out in March), or</li>\n \t<li><strong>HMRC's gov.uk website</strong> - you can check your tax code with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-income-tax-current-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HMRC online</a> if you have an account with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is the tax free personal allowance?</h2>\nBefore we explain the tax code, it's worth exploring what the tax free personal allowance is.\n\nIn the UK, you'll allowed to take home £12,570 in pay before you start paying income tax (your National Insurance tax free allowance is lower). With the basic rate of tax at 20%, the full personal allowance saves you £2,500 a year in income tax.\n\nContained within your code is the level of your personal allowance. Divide the figure contained by 10 to find out what it is. This is why most employees will see the figure \"1257\" featured in their actual tax code.\n\nThe amount of tax free income you can earn usually changes every April in accordance with the Chancellor's previous budget.\n<h2>Explaining tax code letters</h2>\n<table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-left: 1px solid #000000;

People in receipt of taxable state benefits or people who receive employee benefits from work are also often on the K tax code.\n\nLet's say that, as part of your job, an employer provides you with a company car for business and personal use and they pay for the road tax and the petrol you use.\n\nHMRC calculates how much this benefit and any other company benefits you receive are worth to you and they then reduce that amount from your personal allowance.\n\nThe format for this tax code is \"K\" followed by the adjusted personal allowance worked out by the tax man followed by \"L\".\n<h3>The T tax code</h3>\nIf you have a T code, you'll need to consult with your employer to find out more to determine the level of your tax free allowance for the year.\n<h3>The 0T tax code</h3>\nIf your tax code is 0T, then you have used up your Personal Allowance for this tax year or you've started work for a new employer and you haven't provided them with the details they need to give you a tax code.\n<h3>The M &amp; N tax codes</h3>\nThe M tax code and the N tax code relate to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marriage Allowance</a>.\n\nThe Marriage Allowance allows the lower earner in a marriage or civil partnership to transfer 10% of their tax free allowance to their spouse or civil partner if the lower earner is paid (usually) £12,570 or less and the higher earner between £12,501 and £50,270 before they receive Marriage Allowance.\n\nThe M tax code means that you’ve received a transfer of 10% of your partner’s Personal Allowance whereas the N tax codes means that you've transferred 10% of your Personal Allowance to your partner.\n<h3>The BR, D0, and D1 tax codes for a second job or pension</h3>\nThe BR, D0, and D1 codes are used in most cases when you have more than one job or pension.\n\nThe meaning of these tax codes is as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>BR code - your pay or pension is taxed at the basic rate</li>\n \t<li>D0 code - your pay or pension is taxed at the higher rate</li>\n \t<li>D1 code - your pay or pension is taxed at the additional rate</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The NT tax code</h3>\nIf your tax code is NT, this means that you're not paying any tax on the income you're receiving.\n<h3>The W1 and M1 tax codes</h3>\nIf you're on emergency tax code, then you'll see 1257L W1, 1257L M1 and 1257L X on your payslip. W1 represents weekly pay and M1 represents monthly pay.\n\nYou'll be placed on an emergency tax code if you don't give your employer the information they need when they notify HMRC that you're working for them. It's actually HMRC who decides the tax code you're on.\n\nEmergency tax codes are usually issued if:\n<ul>\n \t<li>you didn't receive a P45 from your previous employer or</li>\n \t<li>if you start your first job and this is your first source of income part way through the tax year.</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you're on an emergency code, no account is taken of any allowances or reliefs you receive. In addition, if you start a new job in the fourth month of the tax year, then you should normally receive two thirds of your tax free allowance in your monthly pay packet. With an M1 tax code, only one twelfth of your personal allowance is recognised meaning that you'll likely pay too much tax.\n\nWhen you do eventually hand your P45 or P46 to your employer, your tax code will change to the correct one and you'll be reimbursed for the tax you've overpaid. However, if you don't get it straight away, HMRC will send it to you as a refund.\n<h3>The Y tax code</h3>\nThe tax free income allocated to a person with a Y code is higher because they were before 6 April 1938.\n<h3>The S tax code</h3>\nThe S tax code relates to Scottish income tax. If you live and work in Scotland and you receive the full standard personal allowace, you'll see S1257L as the tax code on your payslip.\n\nIf your tax code is S0T, then you have used up your Personal Allowance or you've started work for a new employer and you haven't provided them with the details they need to give you a tax code.\n\nIf you’ve got more than one job or pension, you may have one of the following tax codes on the list below:\n<ul>\n \t<li>SBR - income from this employer or pension provider is taxed at the basic rate in Scotland</li>\n \t<li>SD0 - income from this employer or pension provider is taxed at the intermediate rate in Scotland</li>\n \t<li>SD1 - income from this employer or pension provider is taxed at the higher rate in Scotland</li>\n \t<li>SD2 - income from this employer or pension provider is taxed at the top rate in Scotland</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The C tax code</h3>\nAlthough employees are taxed at the same rate in Wales as they are in England, people living and working in the country have a different tax code system.\n\nTax codes in Wales begin with C and, if you receive the full standard personal allowace, you'll see C1257L as the tax code on your payslip.\n\nIf your tax code is C0T, then you have used up your Personal Allowance or you've started work for a new employer and you haven't provided them with the details they need to give you a tax code.\n\nIf you’ve got more than one job or pension, you may have one of the following tax codes on the list below:\n<ul>\n \t<li>CBR - your wages or pension is taxed at the basic rate in Wales</li>\n \t<li>CD0 - your wages or pension is taxed at the higher rate in Wales</li>\n \t<li>CD1 - your wages or pension is taxed at the additional rate in Wales</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tax codes in Northern Ireland</h3>\nNorthern Ireland shares the same tax codes as England.\n<h2>Tax code FAQ</h2>\n<h3>What happens if your tax code is wrong?</h3>\nHM Revenue and Customs expect you to tell them if you think your tax code is wrong. That's because, in their minds, they rely on information provided by you and your current/former employee to assign you with the correct tax code.\n\nIf your tax code looks wrong, it probably is. You'll need to contact HMRC as soon as possible - you can do so at their <a href=\"http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/contactus/home.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>.\n<h3>What if I've overpaid tax?</h3>\nIf you've paid too much tax because your code is wrong, you need to tell HMRC straight away on 0300 200 3300.\n\nIf you're overpaying in this tax year (April 6-April 5), HMRC will tell your employer and they'll amend your tax code. On these occasions, employers refund the overpaid tax via your wages. They'll also send you a P800 (\"simple assessment\") letter at the end of the tax year.\n\nYou can claim up to four additional years of overpaid tax. If your claim is older than that and HMRC were to blame for the error, they will consider the case sympathetically.\n<h3>What if I've underpaid tax?</h3>\nWe've seen that you can claim back overpaid tax from the previous four tax years. Likewise, if you've underpaid tax, HMRC can also go back four years as well (although they can go back up to 20 years if you were deliberately underpaying tax in their opinion). HMRC will often agreement repayment plans for larger amounts.\n\nYou may challenge HMRC's attempt to claim underpaid tax by using an A19 form if you can demonstrate a \"reasonable belief\" that your tax affairs were being propertly handled, that HMRC was given the correct information, and that the underpayment is less than 12 months old.\n\nIf your underpayment is less than £50, then HMRC will generally write it off.\n<h3>What about tax codes for people who complete a Self Assessment?</h3>\nIf all of your income is taxed through Self Assessment, you won't recieve a tax code.\n\nFor people who are both employed and self-employed, you will have a tax code and the code you're given will depend on your overall level of earnings as well as how much you're paid from each role.\n<h3>Why is my tax code not 1257L?</h3>\nIf your tax code is not 1257L, it will be for one or more of the following reasons:\n<ul>\n \t<li>you have more than one job,</li>\n \t<li>you've never had a job before and you'll be starting one soon,</li>\n \t<li>you've not had a job for a number of years,</li>\n \t<li>you've not been living in the UK,</li>\n \t<li>you receive universal credit, child benefits, or tax credits,</li>\n \t<li>you earn more than £100,000 during a tax year,</li>\n \t<li>you are retiring or you have retired, and</li>\n \t<li>you're in receipt of employee benefits like healthcare insurance or a company car.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Check whether each job or pension you earn income from is correct</h2>\nIf you've found this page as an employee looking for advice on tax codes and to find out whether you're paying the right amount of tax, then we hope you've found the information we've shared on this page useful.\n\nIt really does pay you money to make sure that employers and pension providers have assigned you with the correct code.

      "content": "If you're new to being a shareholder and/or director of a limited company, you may be aware of the term \"dividends\" but you might not be exactly sure of what one is.\n\nFor many years up until around 2015, dividends were like a reward to business owners from HMRC and the Government for taking the risk of self-employment. With a good accountant by your side, you could use remunerate yourself through a mixture of salary and dividend payments and you'd pay far less in tax than people who worked for other companies.\n\nThat's only fair, right? Limited company owners aren't entitled to sick pay, holiday pay, parental leave, and so on. You don't have the certainty of stable regular income and, last by not least, you are part of an army of a few hundred thousand Brits whose appetite for risk and bravery has resulted in the employment of millions of your fellow countrymen and women.\n\nYou deserve recognition and that was provided in the form of dividends and the dividend voucher.\n\nHowever, these important benefits have been pared back significantly in the last few years as the Government has been on a mission to raise more money from each individual taxpayer so that they can pay down the borrowing incurred during the Great Recession of the late naughties.\n\nIt still pays to take advantage of paying yourself in dividends but dividends aren't nearly as tax efficient as they once were. So, we decided to write a piece to show you how you can maximise the benefit you receive from choosing dividend income over normal salary.\n\nIn this article, the team at Black and White Accounting cover:\n<ul>\n \t<li>What a dividend is</li>\n \t<li>The tax on dividends</li>\n \t<li>The personal tax free allowance</li>\n \t<li>Your dividend allowance</li>\n \t<li>The salary/dividend sp</li>\n \t<li>Two dividend tax case studies</li>\n \t<li>The procedures you need to follow to issue dividends</li>\n \t<li>Reporting dividends to HMRC and how to pay tax on them</li>\n \t<li>Ways to avoid paying dividend tax</li>\n</ul>\nWant to speak with one of our teams about dividend income and on how to reduce your annual tax bill? Please call our dividends specialists on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here to email us</a>.\n<h2>What is a dividend?</h2>\nA dividend is a distribution of retained profits within a limited company to its shareholders.\n\nAs a very general rule of thumb, the division of company shares between you and your fellow shareholders determines the amount that you might personally pay yourself in dividends - something called \"dividend distribution\".\n\nFor example, if you owned 75% of the shares in your company and your business partner owned 25% of the shares, then the amount you receive in dividends should be three times higher than your business partner to reflect the actual shareholding.\n\nIt's not quite as simple as that and there are perfectly legal routes around this rule however. If you get in touch with us, we'll explain how it works.\n<h2>The UK dividend tax - how much tax do I pay on dividends?</h2>\nWe can't take a look at the UK dividend tax without looking at the bigger picture with regards to personal income, specifically in relation to the personal allowance and the dividend allowance.\n<h3>Personal allowance</h3>\nEach tax year, you are entitled a personal allowance. This is the amount of money you can earn without paying income tax and/or dividend tax.\n\nThat rate is currently is £12,570.\n<h3>Dividend allowances</h3>\nEvery tax year, you're entitled to a £2,000 dividend allowance. This means that you can receive £2,000 in dividend payments without having to pay dividend tax.\n<h3>Dividend tax rates and income tax bands</h3>\nSo, in the 2021 tax year,\n<ul>\n \t<li>Your first £12,570 of salary/dividends are tax free - this is your personal allowance (check that tax code 1257L appears on your payslip)</li>\n \t<li>Your first £2,000 of dividend payments are tax free.</li>\n</ul>\nLet's look at income tax rates for someone paid exclusively via PAYE in England:\n<ul>\n \t<li>You'll pay 20% income tax on your taxable income between £12,571 and £50,270 (basic rate)</li>\n \t<li>You'll pay 40% income tax on your taxable income between £50,271 and £150,000 (higher rate)</li>\n \t<li>You'll pay 45% income tax on your taxable income over £150,000 (additional rate)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><strong><em>Black and White note</em></strong> - the personal allowance begins to disappear gradually once you start to earn over £100,000 and it disappears entirely if your taxable income is £125,141 or more. Multiply the number contained in your tax code by 10 to discover your actual personal allowance for the tax year.</blockquote>\nThe situation with the tax on dividends is different. Let's see what the dividend tax rate is depending on how much you take out of your company:\n<ul>\n \t<li>You'll pay 7.5% tax on your dividends if your taxable income between £12,571 and £50,270 (basic rate)</li>\n \t<li>You'll pay 32.5% tax on your dividends if your income between £50,271 and £150,000 (higher rate)</li>\n \t<li>You'll pay 38.1% tax on your dividends if your income over £150,000 (additional rate)</li>\n</ul>\nAs you can see, whatever your income tax band, you'll paya lot less in dividend tax than you would in income tax.\n\nSo how is this applied to the real world?\n<blockquote><strong><em>Black and White note</em></strong> - be sure to check out our dividend tax calculator by <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/resources/?op=%2Fresources%2Fonline-calculators%2Fdividend-tax-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clicking here</a>.</blockquote>\n<h2>Salary/dividend split</h2>\nLet's look at an example of someone earning £62,570 a year - that's £50,000 more than the personal allowance. For the purposes of this example, we're assuming that our subject is not saving any money into a private pension.\n\nIf paid by salary, part of their pay will be in the basic rate band and part in the higher rate band. They would pay £12,528 in income tax and £5,134 in National Insurance leaving take-home pay of £44,908.\n\nIf you paid yourself £12,570 in salary and £50,000 in dividends, you would pay nothing in income tax, £6,742.50 in dividend tax, and £360.24 in National Insurance leaving take-home pay of £55,467.26.\n<h3>Salary/dividend split case studies</h3>\n<h4>Example 1 - £8,840</h4>\nYou could choose to pay yourself £8,840 a year in salary. You won't pay any National Insurance and your company won't pay any National Insurance Employers' contributions.\n\n£8,840 is also above the Lower Earnings Limit for National Insurance you need to pay in to qualify for state benefits.\n\nYou could also declare a dividend payment of £5,730 on top of £8,840 and pay no income tax, dividend tax, or personal National Insurance. After this point, this is when you'll start to pay tax on your dividend income.\n<h4>Example 2 - £12,570</h4>\nIf your limited company employs staff, it may better to pay yourself £12,570 if you're eligible for the Employment Allowance (EA). Under the EA, HMRC refunds the first £4,000 of your National Insurance Employers' Contributions.\n\nThe £514.74 Employers’ NIC your salary attracts will be refunded and you'll save £708.70 in Corporation Tax.\n\nYou'll be better off by £348 a year paying yourself £12,570 if you qualify for EA than if you paid yourself £8,840.\n<h2>What are the procedures for issuing dividends?</h2>\nAs we've seen, on a personal level, paying yourself by dividends can be far more tax efficient. It is complicated though because there are often other factors related to what your company pays in tax which you'll need to consider - please get in touch with us for a costed personal example for your situation.\n\nTo issue a dividend, you need to hold a minuted meeting of directors (even if you are the sole owner) which comes to a resolution to issue you with a dividend voucher. The voucher contains the date on which a dividend is paid, the company name, the name of the shareholders receiving a dividend, and the amount of the dividend.\n\nPlease keep all paperwork related to dividends and remember to send them to your accountants.\n<h2>When is dividend tax payable?</h2>\nYou declare your dividend income on your self assessment tax return.\n\nIf you complete a self assessment tax return, you must declare your earnings in full as well as pay tax on dividends and all your other incomes stream by 31st January following the end of the tax year (6th April-5th April).\n\nIf you have tax to pay, you can make payment direct from your bank account, via direct debit, or on your debit card. You cannot make payment via a personal credit card although you can make payment (for a fee) by corporate credit card or corporate debit card.\n<h2>How do I avoid paying tax on dividends?</h2>\nYou can't avoid paying tax on your dividend income but there are ways you can structure the way that you pay yourself to reduce your dividend tax liability including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Using up your ISA allowance (including on the first day of the new tax year)</li>\n \t<li>Tranferring assets to your spouse to invest in a Bed &amp; Spouse &amp; ISA</li>\n \t<li>Transferring assets to your spouse which generate dividends of up to £2,000</li>\n \t<li>Using your pension allowance</li>\n</ul>\nPlease consult with your accountants before taking any of the above measures.\n<h2>Keeping as much money as possible with Black and White Accounting</h2>\nHere at Black and White Accounting, our job is to allow you keep as much of the profit you make from your businesses as possible from the taxman.\n\nTo find out more about our services, please call our dividends specialists on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here to email us</a>.",

      "content": "Do you have to wear a uniform for work? Do you have to wash it, repair it, or replace it out of your own pocket? If you do, you can claim a uniform tax rebate going back over the last five years meaning that HMRC might owe you hundreds of pounds. It doesn't matter whether you're an airline pilot, a nurse, or a police officer - you can make a claim.\n\nThere are dozens of firms out there offering to help you claim on your work uniform for a fee. We're going to show you how to do it for free.\n\nIn this article, Black and White Accounting covers:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Why you can't claim on personal protective clothing</li>\n \t<li>Who is eligible for a uniform tax rebate</li>\n \t<li>How much your uniform tax rebate could be worth</li>\n \t<li>How do you make a claim to HMRC?</li>\n \t<li>Frequently asked questions about claiming tax back on work clothing</li>\n</ul>\nTo find out more about our services, please call our tax saving team on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here to email us</a>.\n<h2>Can I claim for personal protective clothing?</h2>\nIf what you do requires you to wear personal protective equipment, you should receive that from your employer free of charge.\n\nIf you have to buy it, they should pay you back the costs. If they don't, for whatever reason, you may be able to claim tax relief on it.\n<h2>So who is eligible for a uniform tax rebate?</h2>\nTo be eligible for this tax allowance, four main criteria have to be met:\n<h3>1. You paid income tax in the relevant tax year</h3>\nThis means that you can't claim a uniform tax rebate if if's for a tax year in which you paid no income tax\n<h3>2. The uniform you have shows that you work in a particular job</h3>\nFor example, a police officer, a nurse, or a shop assistant within a retail store wearing branded a T shirt containing the company logo. HMRC's test for this is that other members of the public would recognise your profession and/or your employer if they saw you on the street. You can try to make a claim for non-branded and plain clothing but there's no guarantee that you'll receive a tax refund in these circumstances\n<h3>3. You have to buy the uniform and clean, repair, and replace it yourself</h3>\nIf your employer washes your uniform for you or provides facilities for you to clean your uniform, you can't claim.\n<h3>4. You're required to wear the uniform by your employer</h3>\nIf this is the case, you have no option but to buy your uniform and, therefore, your uniform tax rebate claim is likely to be valid.\n<h2>How much is this tax relief worth to me?</h2>\nYou can claim flat rate expenses of up to £60 for uniform maintenance. If you're a basic rate taxpayer, you'll get 20% of this sum back (£12). For higher rate taxpayers, it's 40% (£24).\n\nAs with nearly all HMRC flat rate schemes, you don't need to keep receipts for the individual amounts of money you want to claim back.\n<h3>HMRC's table of industries and occupations</h3>\nThe amount you can claim back with the flat rate scheme differs according to your occupation. Just below, you can see HMRC's latest table for claiming tax relief by specific professions.\n\nFor example:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cement works, roofing felt and asphalt labourers' allowances are £80</li>\n \t<li>Motor mechanics in a garage repair shop have an allowance of £120</li>\n \t<li>Pilots, co-pilots, helicopter pilots and uniformed flight deck crew have an allowance of £1,022, and</li>\n \t<li>In practices where everyone is required to wear the same colour or style, nurses, midwives, chiropodists, dental nurses, occupational, speech, physiotherapists and other therapists, healthcare assistants, phlebotomists and radiographers have a shoes and stockings or tights allowance of £125.</li>\n</ul>\nHere's HMRC's full table of uniform benefits and tax reliefs for other work expenses:\n<table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-left: 1px solid #000000;

If you're just claiming for the uniform tax rebate, ignore the other section.\n<h3>What about if you've claimed before?</h3>\nAs we mentioned before, if you've made a successful claim already, HMRC should have adjusted your tax code to make sure that the fact you wear a uniform and you're responsible for its cleaning, repair, and replacement is reflected in the tax you actually pay.\n\nIf they haven't and you wish to claim again for expenses totally less than £1,000, call 0300 200 3310 between 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday and between 8am to 4pm on Saturday.\n\nYou may receive a P810 form from HMRC - this is its \"Tax Review\" form which it sends out to check that your tax code is correct. You may also use the P810 to claim your uniform tax rebate although if you're claiming for more than £1,000 of expenses or you changed jobs during the tax year, the taxman will ask you to fill in an additional form.\n<h2>When do I get the money?</h2>\nWhen you've registered your claim with HMRC, your tax code will change to reflect your expenses if your tax rebate claim is for the current year. Although the amount will be very small, you'll see a slight increase in your after-tax pay from now on.\n\nIf you're claiming for previous years, HMRC will adjust your tax code or they'll issue you with a cheque or make a bank transfer for your tax refund.\n<h2>Uniform tax rebates FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Can Armed Forces personnel claim for relief?</h3>\nThe way uniform tax rebates are dealt with by the Armed Forces is different.\n\nThe difference is that your claim is dealt with through your tax code. When you make a claim, the level of your tax-free personal allowance is raised to reflect the costs you've incurred.\n<h3>Can self-employed people make a claim?</h3>\nThings are also different for the self-employed. You need to claim for tax relief on your self assessment tax return.\n\nTo do this, you should claim laundry and uniform expenses on your tax return - if in doubt, ask your accountant for advice.\n<h3>What if I only wear the uniform for part of the year?</h3>\nYou can still make a claim because the tax relief for cleaning a uniform is flat rate.\n\nThis applies even if you only wore the uniform for one or two days in a tax year.\n<h3>Can I claim for laundry costs if my employer provide laundry facilities?</h3>\nNo. Even if you don't use their laundry facilities, you can't make a claim for laundry expenses.\n<h3>Should I keep receipts?</h3>\nFor most flat rate uniform tax rebates, you won't need to keep any specific requests. As with virtually all flat rate schemes provided by the taxman, you don't really required detailed bookkeeping records to make a claim.\n<h3>Advice for specific professions</h3>\nAs long as you're personally paying to replace, repair, or clean your work clothes, you're almost certainly entitled to claim back money from the taxman.\n\nBut you may also be able to claim for the following depending on your profession:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>gambling industry</strong> - Personal Function licence fees and Security Industry Authority licences</li>\n \t<li><strong>lorry drivers</strong> -  food and accommodation bills, medical examinations, and digital tachograph smartcards</li>\n \t<li><strong>teachers</strong> - protective gear for science or metalworking lessons, union subscriptions, and subscription fees for professional bodies</li>\n \t<li><strong>healthcare</strong> - professional subscription fees and insurance costs</li>\n \t<li><strong>airline crew</strong> - sunglasses, flight cases, passports, BALPA subscriptions, visas, and vaccination costs</li>\n \t<li><strong>security </strong>- Security Industry Authority licences</li>\n \t<li><strong>police officers</strong> - Police Federation subscriptions</li>\n \t<li><strong>mechanics </strong>- purchase, repair, and replacement of your own tools, safety gear, and more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Claim tax relief for yourself or get Black and White Accounting to do it for you</h2>\nBlack and White Accounting is a growing firm of accountants in the South of England servicing personal and corporate clients in the region and across the UK.\n\nWe hope you've found the information useful in this article.\n\nIf you are an employer and you want to make sure that your staff are getting the tax relief they're entitled to, please get in touch with us.

      "content": "Launched on the 6th April 2021, the Recovery Loan Scheme is a new debt finance package backed by the government to provide businesses with the money they need to recover and grow following the restrictions imposed as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe naming is symbolic but important - the intended purpose of the scheme is not to help businesses survive. Instead, the purpose is to help improve cash flow management and to stimulate economic growth through investment.\n\nThe government sees increasing the velocity of money as the key to full and sustained recovery - in other words, they want people to spend more money faster.\n\nThe belief is that, in a short space of time, this will create a \"fly-wheel\" effect which will give business and consumers the confidence they need to purchase more goods and services. This will lead to economic growth, rising wages, and falling unemployment. The Recovery Loan was launched shortly after the Government's announcement to extended to Annual Investment Allowance temporary cap of £1 million to 1 January 2022.\n\nThis all sounds good in theory and, in this article, we'll take a deeper look at the Recovery Loan scheme and what it might mean for your business.\n\nTo find out more, please call our accounting and business team on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here to email us</a>.\n<h2>What is the new Recovery Loan Scheme?</h2>\nThe coronavirus pandemic inflicted significant financial and operational wounds on British businesses and, in some cases, entire sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Recovery Loan is a government-guaranteed loan designed to helped businesses recover and grow affected by coronavirus.\n<blockquote><strong><em>Black and White note</em></strong> - the Recovery Loan Scheme is adminstered and managed by the British Business Bank plc. Financial backing is provided by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy. The British Business Bank plc is a development bank wholly owned by HM Government. It is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.</blockquote>\n<h2>Should I be happy or concerned that the loan is \"government guaranteed\"?</h2>\nThe government will guarantee 80% of the value of the loan but the borrower - that is, your limited company - will be liable for the remainder.\n\nIn other words, the bank or financial institution will pursue your limited company for the debt in case of default. If they can't collect the entire amount from you, the government will repay up to 80% of the outstanding balance.\n\nBut it's more complicated than that as we'll explore later.\n<h2>Which types of finance are available with the Recovery Loan Scheme?</h2>\nThe Recovery Loan offers the following two types of financing:\n<ul>\n \t<li>for term loans and overdrafts, you can apply for £25,001 to £10 million and</li>\n \t<li>for invoice-backed factoring and asset-based finance, you can apply to borrow from £1,000 to £10 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Which types of businesses are eligible for the Recovery Loan Scheme?</h3>\nTo access the new scheme, your business must:\n<ul>\n \t<li>have been adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,</li>\n \t<li>must be viable or would be viable had the pandemic not occured, and</li>\n \t<li>trade in the UK.</li>\n</ul>\nThe Recovery Loan is not open to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>state-funded primary and secondary schools</li>\n \t<li>banks, insurers, or reinsurers (with the exception of insurance brokers),</li>\n \t<li>public sector organisations, and</li>\n \t<li>companies in ‘collective insolvency proceedings’.</li>\n</ul>\nAll applications will be subject to fraud checks, credit checks, and standard lending assessments.\n<h2><strong>How do you apply for a Recovery Loan?</strong></h2>\nYou need to approach a participating bank or financial institution to apply through the Recovery Loan Scheme.\n\nAt time of writing, the lenders involved in the scheme include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Adam &amp; Company,</li>\n \t<li>Aldermore,</li>\n \t<li>Arbuthnot Latham,</li>\n \t<li>Bank of Scotland,</li>\n \t<li>Barclays,</li>\n \t<li>Clydesdale Bank</li>\n \t<li>Coutts</li>\n \t<li>Danske Bank</li>\n \t<li>Ebury</li>\n \t<li>HTB</li>\n \t<li>HSBC UK</li>\n \t<li>Lloyds Bank</li>\n \t<li>NatWest</li>\n \t<li>OakNorth Bank</li>\n \t<li>Paragon</li>\n \t<li>Santander</li>\n \t<li>Scania Financial Service</li>\n \t<li>Secure Trust Bank</li>\n \t<li>Skipton Business Finance,</li>\n \t<li>RBS,</li>\n \t<li>Triodos Bank,</li>\n \t<li>Ulster Bank, and</li>\n \t<li>Yorkshire Bank.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How much can you apply to borrow?</h3>\nYou can apply to borrow up to £10m from lenders accredited by the British Business Bank. The minimum loan available is £25,001.\n<h3>What information and documentation will I need to supply?</h3>\nThe type of information and documentation you're likely to be asked for includes but is not limited to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>an up-to-date business plan</li>\n \t<li>previous year's accounts</li>\n \t<li>management accounts (including forecasts)</li>\n \t<li>your asset register</li>\n \t<li>information on other overdrafts and loans used by the business, and</li>\n \t<li>information on your personal credit card debt, overdraft, mortgage, or loans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Will I or my company be credit-checked by applying for the scheme?</h3>\nThe Recovery Loan application form requires you to provide permission to the bank or financial institution handling your request to run credit checks and fraud checks.\n\nUnlike when you applied for a CBILS, CLBILS, or BBLS facility, your application will be subject to bank's normal lending criterias.\n<h3>Will I and my other directors have to give personal guarantees?</h3>\nOn loans of £250,000 or more, you have to provide a personal guarantee. If your business goes bust and it borrowed more than £250,000, you and the other shareholders in the company will be pursued for payment of the outstanding balance.\n\nIn some cases, banks and financial institutions may look to secure the loan against business assets (property, land, equipment, vehicles, and so on) which may reduce your personal liability should your company not be able to repay the loan.\n\nPersonal guarantees do not apply on loans of £249,999 or less (with some institutions, that figure is £299,999).\n<h3>When will we have to start making repayments?</h3>\nRepayments start one month after you take out the facility.\n<h3>How long will we have to repay the loan?</h3>\nThe maximum term for loans and asset finance is up to 6 years.\n\nThere are no loan arrangement fees on facilities worth up to £2,999,999. Companies borrowing £299,999 or less will not be penalised for repaying their loan early.\n\nFor invoice finance and overdrafts, you'll have a maximum of three years to repay the loan.\n<h3>What fees and interest rates will be added to the Recovery Loan?</h3>\nThere are no upfront fees to pay to apply for the Recovery Loan Scheme and lenders' interest rates have been capped at 14.99% by the government.\n<h3>What if my company already has a CBILS or Bounce Back Loan?</h3>\nAs long as you meet the eligibility critera, you can still apply for a recovery loan even if you have taken out a facility under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (CBILS, CLBILS or BBLS).\n<h3>How long will applications for the Recovery Loan be accepted?</h3>\nApplications will no longer be accepted after 31 December 2021 subject to review by HM Government.\n<h2>Build your own coronavirus pandemic recovery plan</h2>\nWhile this funding may provide useful for some companies, the key to recovery for businesses affected by coronavirus-related government measures lies with the owners of the business.\n\nYou've got to take credit for the fact that you've steered your business through the biggest economic shock in over 300 years.\n\nThankfully, all signs point to a very quick economic recovery and there's a feeling among economists that there is a wall of pent-up demand and cash which will be spent in the coming year or two. And your business is there to take advantage of it.\n\nNow is the time to think about your own coronavirus pandemic recovery plan. We recommend that you:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Replace any expensive debt you have with cheaper Recovery Loan debt</strong> - you can pay your debt down over a long time for less money</li>\n \t<li><strong>Think about what it is you want from your business personally and professionally in the coming 12-24 months</strong> - can you afford it and, if you need external funding, how much do you need?</li>\n \t<li><strong>Look for new opportunities within your current market</strong> - carry out some research into the impact the pandemic has had on your most significant competitors and look to capitalise on getting their clients to come over to you.</li>\n</ul>\nOver the past 20 years, we have provided business planning for clients across a wide spectrum of sectors helping them to identify their strengths, shore up their weaknesses, and take advantage of growth opportunities.\n\nWe'd welcome the chance to work with you and your business.\n<h2>Working with Black and White Accounting</h2>\nEvery company was affected in some way by COVID 19. It's required all of us to think about the way we run our businesses and the way we manage what cash we have available in our business bank accounts. If you've come out the other end of it, you'll soon be trading in a marketplace similar to the size it was before the pandemic hit but with fewer competitors.\n\nBefore you take out a Recovery Loan, make sure that your business proposition is sound and it's ready for trading in a post-COVID 19 world. You've survived - now it's time to grow.\n\nTo find out more about our business growth service, please call our accounting and business team on 0800 140 464 or <a href=\"https://jon@blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here to email us</a>.",

      "content": "Self assessment tax returns! Do those words bring on a headache? As we approach the winter months and the end of the year our thoughts may be turning to more exciting things than tax returns (psst! there only 11 weekends until Christmas!). However, now is a very good time to start thinking about filing your 2018-2019 tax return (if you haven’t already); instead of spending your Christmas hols completing it.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Do You Need An Accountant To Complete Your Tax Return?</h2>\nThere is no mandatory requirement for the self-employed or small companies, to <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accountancy-enquiry-contact-page/\">use an accountant</a>. So <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/sole-traders-services/\">for sole traders</a> and small businesses with straightforward accounts, or a low income that necessitates making savings, completing your own tax return is entirely feasible. With the advent of cloud accounting systems such as <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-bookkeeping-software-implementation-training-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Xero</a>, the process is even easier with all your accounting information held in one place. But there are good reasons why <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/how-to-find-an-accountant-for-your-business/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"42\">an</a> accountant can be an asset to your business, and why you should delegate the job of filing your tax return to an expert.\n<h2>Benefits Of An Accountant</h2>\nPerhaps the major benefit is that you can pass that headache over to someone else! This also means that you can invest your time in more profitable ways, doing what you do best for your business. If you are only required to complete the short version of the self assessment tax return, then your accounts may be simple enough for you to justify spending the time on this yourself. However, if it’s likely to take you some time, consider what you could be doing instead…\n\nThe other key advantage over <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">completing tax returns</a> yourself is that an accountant should be able to spot <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/savings-calculator/\">ways you can save money</a>. In fact, even after paying the accountant’s fee you could make significant savings, especially if you have missed expenses that could be claimed for in the past.\n\nError is also a factor when you file your own tax return, and you can’t be expected to keep up-to-date with tax law and its implications, especially if your business is unrelated to finance and accounting. Naturally, a trusted accountant will know exactly where you stand in relation to tax rules and regulations, and will give you the peace of mind that your tax return has been completed correctly.\n<h2>Finding An Accountant that suits you</h2>\nIf you decide that you would like to get an expert to do your tax return, then now is the time to find an accountant. Don’t leave it until the last minute! Although many accountants offer a one off <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">service for self assessment tax returns</a>, their priority will always be with their existing clients, and therefore may not be able to fit you in if you leave it until the New Year.\n\nThere are budget options online but many of these amount to little more than data input services, by the time you’ve provided the information you may as well have filed it directly to HMRC. It’s worth shopping around to find a service that also offers advice on expenses, business use of a home, pension contributions etc. so that you can potentially reduce your taxes.\n\nOf course accountants do not just complete tax returns, they perform a multitude of other duties too, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/accounts-services/the-best-bookkeeping-accountancy-service-near-me/\">Book keeping.</a></li>\n \t<li>Setting up and <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-payroll-pensions-and-benefits-in-kind-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">running company payroll</a>.</li>\n \t<li>Registering the company with relevant tax departments –VAT,Corporation Tax, PAYE, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Dealing with company and accounting related correspondence – Companies House, HMRC etc.</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-planning-and-structuring-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">Tax planning advice</a>.</li>\n \t<li>Budgets, <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/the-best-cash-flow-planning-service-near-me/\">cash flows &amp; business plan</a> reports.</li>\n \t<li>Dividend administration</li>\n \t<li>Business mentoring.</li>\n \t<li>Providing professional references.</li>\n</ul>\nYou can find an ACCA certified accountant in your area by searching here.\n\nSo if you are a growing business it may be time to talk to an accountant about your long term plans, not just your year-end tax return. For holistic guidance tailored to your growing business, engaging with a <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/admin-services/the-best-tax-returns-service-in-surrey-hampshire/\">professional self-assessment accountant</a> can provide insights beyond year-end tax returns. At Black and White Accounting we look after clients with varying accountancy needs; from self-employed sole traders or <a href=\"https://blackandwhiteaccounting.co.uk/freelancers-services/\">freelancers</a>, to limited companies including micro businesses and SMEs.
