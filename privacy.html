            <p>Any personal information supplied to Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants by clients, employees or consultants is stored on a secure cloud content management and file sharing service for the duration of the task. Information may be supplied via email and be stored in a cloud-based email system.</p>
            <p>The computing resources managed by the cloud provider may be located outside the UK/EEA. A cloud provider may have a number of data centres, each of which could be located in a different country. This design can improve the reliability of the cloud service but also means that it can be difficult to know where data is being processed. To mitigate against risk Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants only engage with US cloud providers who participate in the Privacy Shield Scheme or have made arrangements to provide storage facilities in the UK/EEA.</p>
            <p>All information stored for invoicing purposes is held in cloud-based accounting software.</p>
            <p>All Black and White Chartered Certified Accountants computer equipment is password protected and uses anti-virus software.</p>

            <p>We do not use any form of automated decision making in our practice.</p>

            <h2>About Cookies</h2>
