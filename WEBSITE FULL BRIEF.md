## Black and White Accounting

**Locations:** Wraysbury (Middlesex) & Herriard (near Basingstoke, Hampshire)
**Primary Conversion Goal:** Enquiries (form submissions + phone calls)
**Primary CTA:**
📞 **Phone Us: 0800 140 4644**
📝 **Enquiry Forms** (short, friendly, low-friction)

---

## 1. Strategic Goals

### Core Objectives

1. **Make it instantly clear what you do** (Tax, Accounts, Advisory)
2. **Feel information-rich without feeling heavy**
3. **Guide users effortlessly to the right service**
4. **Convert visitors into enquiries at multiple touchpoints**
5. **Look premium, modern, calm, and trustworthy**
6. **Be exceptional on mobile** (not just “responsive”)

### Target Audience

* Individuals (PAYE, landlords, high earners)
* Sole traders & freelancers
* SMEs & limited companies
* Business owners needing proactive advice
* Sector-specific clients (construction, property, e-commerce, etc.)

Tone:
**Professional but human. Confident, not corporate. Helpful, not salesy.**

---

## 2. Visual & Design System

### Overall Look & Feel

* Minimalist, high-end, **white-space-led**
* Soft pastel section backgrounds
* Brighter gradients reserved for **CTA banners & navigation modules**
* Rounded corners, soft shadows, subtle motion
* Typography-first design (clarity over decoration)

---

### Colour System

#### Core Gradient Modules (CTA / Navigation Banners)

Use sparingly for **important transitions or prompts**:

1. `#fae3f0 → #fee9d9`
2. `#fce9d9 → #cae3f4`
3. `#c6e6f5 → #fae3ef`

Use these for:

* “Explore Services” blocks
* Contact banners
* Cross-page service promotion modules

#### Backgrounds

* White (#FFFFFF)
* Very light pastel tints (derived from gradient colours)
* Alternating sections for visual rhythm

---

### Logos

* **Horizontal long logo** → Header, footer, hero sections
* **Circular logo** → Cards, testimonials, badges, CTA modules

Use **placeholder image frames** for all logos:

* `LOGO_HORIZONTAL_PLACEHOLDER`
* `LOGO_CIRCLE_PLACEHOLDER`

---

### Image Placeholders (IMPORTANT)

Use **named placeholder frames throughout** so they can be swapped 1:1 later.

**Shapes**

* Circular (team, people, trust)
* Rounded rectangles (office, lifestyle, abstract)

**Naming Convention Examples**

* `IMG_HERO_TEAM_CIRCLE`
* `IMG_OFFICE_WRAYSBURY_RECT`
* `IMG_ADVISORY_ABSTRACT_RECT`
* `IMG_SECTOR_CONSTRUCTION_RECT`

---

### Header

* Logo (horizontal)
